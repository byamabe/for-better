## 7.2 DIVORCE

What, therefore, God hath joined together let not man put asunder. - Mark 10:9

Periodically American newspaper-readers have been entertained with livid accounts of the divorce orgy in Soviet Russia, where, until recently, the official fracture of the marriage vow has steadily become easier, quicker, cheaper. In the first days of the Soviet régime the average divorce required twenty-two minutes; but that was before Red authorities had profited by practical acquaintance with modern methods. Now, we are told, by substituting up-to-date files for the old cumbersome registry ledgers, a Moscow divorce is granted in twelve minutes and at proportionately reduced fees.

Before we shake our heads and draw unwarranted comparisons emphasizing our American moral superiority, let us listen to the grinding of our own divorce mills as they roll on in the creak and whirl that would delight many a Red commissariat. The following picture, drawn by A. B. MacDonald, Pulitzer-prize winner for 1931, sketches the Reno divorce debauch: "Divorces are handled here by two judges in two courts. I spent a day in those courts and saw the mill grind out many divorces. If the case is uncontested, the procedure is very simple. Suppose it is the case of Mrs. Jones against Mr. Jones. The judge calls:

"'Case No. 7,500, Jones versus Jones.'

"Lawyer Smith arises and says, 'Ready, Your Honor,' and he beckons to Mrs. Jones and a woman who accompanies her, and they step forward and are sworn. The judge asks, 'Is the defendant represented here?' and thereupon a lawyer arises and states that he represents Mr. Jones and that he does not desire to contest the case.

"Mrs. Jones takes the witness chair, and her lawyer asks her a few questions: her name, former residence, when married whether she has lived in Reno continuously for forty-two days, and if it is her intention to maintain her residence in Nevada, and 'How did your husband treat you?' 'He neglected me,' 'failed to provide,' or, 'he deserted me,' are the usual replies. Just a few short questions and answers.

"Then the plaintiff's witness is called and swears that she keeps a boarding-house or hotel or apartment at such a place and that Mrs. Jones has resided there continuously for forty-two days. It must be a 'continuous residence' for forty-two days. The applicant is not allowed to leave the jurisdiction of the court for even one day, or he or she might spend money elsewhere.

"Having heard these two witnesses, the judge gives the papers in the case a flip and smooths them out on his bench. He seizes a pen and cries out in a singsong voice the old formula: "Case No. 7,500: Jones versus Jones, decree of divorce granted, as prayed for, to the plaintiff.'

"His pen scratches as he talks; he blots the entry, tosses the paper over to the clerk of the court, and calls the next case. Generally it has all been done in two minutes."

With this two-minute rate Reno seems to have snatched the record for speedy divorces from Chicago. A newspaper reporter in that city, visiting a branch of the circuit court, saw a total of fifty divorces granted in two hours and fifteen minutes!

Not all divorces are rushed through at this high-speed rate. When impending separations involve public idols or individuals who can be counted upon for heavy head-lines, the process may be apparently more deliberative, the gestures more serious. Yet in the instance of some widely discussed divorces the judicial speedometer has registered surprisingly high. When Senator William Gibbs McAdoo, former Secretary of the Treasury, was divorced from the daughter of the late President Wilson in a hearing that lasted a little more than half an hour, Frank C. Collier, presiding judge of the Superior Court of California, announced an investigation of the speed with which this divorce was granted. Of course, no action was taken. A judicial inquiry would perhaps be more in place in the later Reno divorce of Mrs. Anna Roosevelt Dall. This was granted in ten minutes and behind closed doors, — "out of deference to the President of the United States." Barbara Hutton Mdivani, five-and-ten-cent-store heiress, was divorced from her Georgian prince after a ten-minute Reno hearing. The same evening she danced at a crowded night club with Count Kurt Haugwitz-Reventlow, whom she married two days later.

### A NATION OF HOME-BREAKERS

Not only is the legal red tape of the divorce trial snipped to a minimum, but State Legislatures have run a neck-to-neck race in the competitive effort to make the required residence shorter. In some of our Western States the divorce business in point of financial return ranks next to the most productive of the legalized industries, a prolific source of income to be cultivated and coddled with legislative protection. That is why, when Arkansas and Idaho had reduced their residence requirements and Reno, the "nation's divorce capital," was threatened with a loss of $3,000,000 annual income, the Nevada Legislature in 1931 cut the period of legal sojourn to only six weeks. The best Arkansas could do was to establish a ninety-day residence, permitting either husband or wife to petition for divorce sixty days after establishing the Arkansas residence. When the Supreme Court of that State, on November 23, 1933, finally removed all legal obstacles to this enactment, hotels of Arkansas issued a booklet entitled A New Approach to Freedom, with this introductory paragraph of propaganda: "This new measure brings freedom from marital ties within reach of thousands of people, who may at the same time enjoy benefits of Arkansas' mild, invigorating climate."

When the Montana Legislature, early in 1939, passed a bill declaring that it would be legal in that State to file divorce action after only thirty days, thus reducing by twelve days the requirements of Nevada and neighboring States, newspapers admitted: "Sponsors of the divorce measure make no effort to conceal its commercial purpose." Neither did the chief executive of Montana conceal his conviction. When Governor Roy E. Ayers vetoed the bill, he stated: "Montana does not want to profiteer on others' misfortunes. I do not believe Montana should have the stigma of commercializing on the unsuccessful and the unfortunate marriage and the domestic troubles of her sister States."

More recently Florida began to lower its bars. Under legislation passed during the spring, 1935, session at Tallahassee and signed by the governor, divorces will now be granted in any part of America's Riviera State after a ninety-day stay. Representative Frost frankly called the new code Florida's bid for the lucrative divorce trade. In the first session of its 1935 Legislature, Wyoming reduced the legal period from one year to sixty days, under the hearty approval of resort-owners, dude ranchers, and local attorneys. Not only is the divorce service in these States granted after a minimum of time, but much is done to facilitate divorce. In his report on migratory divorces, recently published by the Law School of Duke University, Rollo Bergeson declares: "If you should direct a single inquiry, you would shortly be flooded with offers of services which would take care of you from the moment you leave your own doorstep until, decked out with a new divorce, you reach whatever destination you have in mind, extras included." (New York Herald-Tribune, November 17, 1935.)

So the race is on, with three States in Mexico, Morelos, Sonora, and Chihuahua, among the latest entrées in this sordid competition. These Mexicans, it is said, are responsible for much insomnia on the part of the less reputable in our legal profession, since the trans-Rio Grande attorneys are willing to grant uncontested divorce without any legal residence. Just across from El Paso, for example, a divorce mill in Juarez advertises that for $200 a decree may be obtained even though the petitioning parties have never been within 1,000 miles of Juarez. The circulars of an El Paso lawyer, advertising his Mexican connections, claim that in 1934 more divorces were issued across the river in Juarez than in Reno. Chihuahua lawyers boasted of 5,000 trials in a single year. These Mexican "mail-order" divorces are often granted after mock trials, in which no serious effort is made to serve papers or conduct an impartial hearing. And now comes Peru, offering to foreigners divorce by "mutual consent" as soon as they set foot on Peruvian soil, Ecuador introducing quick and easy divorce laws, El Universo, the Guayaquil daily, nominating that city as the divorce mecca, and Brazilian centers lining up for a cut in these spoils. Paris used to be the scene of many American divorces; but Havana is so much nearer, and the legal procedures there are attained so much more cheaply that the Cuban capital has forged ahead of French competition. The New York Herald-Tribune, discussing these foreign divorces, declares (November 17, 1935): "Travel agencies and hotels naturally have collaborated with lawyers in making these divorce quests enjoyable where the parties appear in person. Divorce tours, with all arrangements completed in advance, have been offered."

American ingenuity will meet foreign rivalry in this field as it has in others. Even if the plan of an astute Westerner, who proposes that his State grant divorces by mail, without the inconvenience of a transcontinental trip, may prove too radical for his liberal-minded associates, somehow America will manage to maintain its unenviable leadership in divorces. When easier and quicker divorces are granted, this country will grant them. The notorious distinction of being a nation of many home-breakers will remain ours. With one divorce for almost every six American marriages, with more divorces granted in the United States within the last thirty-five years than in all the rest of Christendom combined, we are living in an age that flaunts its marriage wrecks.

Alfred Cahan has shown that, while the population of the United States increased by more than 200 per cent between 1867 and 1929, and while marriages grew by 400 per cent during this period, the divorce-rate in these sixty-two years had advanced 2,000 per cent. Similarly it is no pleasant picture of the American home which Statistician Louis I. Dublin drew in an address before a New York audience in this discouraging comparison: "In 1887 there were 5.5 divorces for every 100 marriages; in 1900 there were 7.9, and in 1930, 17" And he finished the comparison by warning: "Out of every 9 marriages now existing, 2 are likely to end in divorce."

Sir Wilfred Grenfell, internationally known medical missionary to Labrador, says, by contrast, that the natives of that country never have a divorce. "The families," he reports, stick together to the last ditch."

A bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, returning from India, protested that educated Hindus point to the riotous prevalence of divorce in our country and ask, "What has Christianity done for you?" Confucianists and Shintoists in Japan can well level the finger of scorn at us; for the divorce rate of heathen Nippon has steadily declined, while "Christian" America's just as steadily increases. In 1901 Japan had 140 divorces in every 100,000 of its population; but by 1923 this figure had been reduced to 88. We, on the other hand, had 79 divorces for every 100,000 of our population in 1901, but in 1926 we had 154, - almost the double of the Japanese figure. (American Journal of Sociology, Novem-ber, 1930, p. 35 fF.)

A cross-section of upper-crust American society, as affected by the divorce scandal, is pictured by the following item from Broadway Brevities: "James H.R. Cromwell was a member of Jimmie Walker's [now divorced and married to Betty Compton, actress] party, ... son of the late Oliver Cromwell of New York. His mother, Eva Roberts, later married Edward T. Stotesbury, Philadelphia millionaire, becoming his second wife. James Cromwell was divorced by Delphine Dodge, who later married Raymond T. Baker, former director of the Mint. Baker was previously divorced by Margaret Emerson, Baltimore heiress. Margaret first divorced Smith McKim and then became the second wife of the late Alfred G. Vanderbilt.

"After divorcing Baker, she chose as her fourth husband Charles Minot Amory, whose first wife, Gladys Munn, is now Mrs. Herbert Pulitzer. Before James Cromwell was divorced by Delphine Dodge, he had a most picturesque father-in-law. Delphine's mother, the widowed Mrs. Horace E. Dodge, who inherited many millions from the automobile industry, chose as her second husband Hugh McGaughey of Columbus, who became an actor as Hugh Dillman and was divorced by Marjorie Rambeau after she had divorced Willard Mack. James Cromwell's brother, Oliver Eaton Cromwell, was divorced by Hope Beale and married Katharine Dahlgren after she had divorced Richard Smith Emmett. The heiress sister of James and Oliver Cromwell, Louise Cromwell, divorced Walter B. Brooks, Jr., who then married Marian Rice, and Major-General Douglas MacArthur before marrying Lionel Atwill, the actor. Atwill was first divorced by Phyllis Relph, actress, and then divorced Elsie Mackay, actress."

### NO PROMISE OF IMPROVEMENT

The outlook holds little promise for future improvement. If the rate of divorce increase reached within the last decade or two continues until 1950, about one fourth of all marriages will end in divorce at that time. By 1990 one half will be similarly terminated. This specter is no hare-brain hallucination; for all symptoms, even by hasty diagnosis, point to a continued advance in domestic disruption. Almost every piece of divorce legislation rushed through our State Assemblies is designed to aid the splitting of American familiies, to "modernize domestic legislation," as the Chicago Tribune labels its support of liberalized marriage laws (April 11, 1933). The very men whose office charges them to uphold the sanctity of the American family and to execute faithfully the laws safeguarding the home are often the first to support radical divorce proposals. A Reno judge who in twelve years granted 20,000 divorces — a pronounced exponent of easy and repeated marriage and a disgrace to any American bench - invites the unhappily married: "Come, to Reno, get a divorce, and try again for the prize in the matrimonial lottery and keep on trying until you find true love." This legal ballyhoo helps account for the fact that there is no depression in Reno, where during a recent year more than one divorce for every two marriages was recorded. Not only at Reno have divorce rates increased. In the city of St. Louis, during 1935, 2,531 local couples severed their marital ties, while only seven petitions for domestic freedom were denied. Assuming that the domestic courts function eight hours a day, on the five days they convene, this figure (an increase of 37 per cent over 1933) represents an average of about one divorce each hour.

Much of present-day literature shouts its approval of the current breakdown in marriage. In 1888 a young woman wrote a letter to the etiquette editor of the Ladies' Home Journal asking about the propriety of cartying a portse usefulie ind minder. able propriety of the parasol, this feminine appendage caters to vanity and is conducive to flirtation. Fifty years later, in 1938, the same Ladies Home Journal conducted an extensive investigation and among other things showed that 69 per cent of America's women "favor divorce."

What changes in public and domestic morals will the next fifty years bring if the past five decades have leaped from questioning the parasol to favoring divorce?

If American magazines, including the home journals, continue on the course which they have taken during the past few years and keep on featuring and fondling divorce, giving their readers the impression that, while it is a necessary evil, it is to be condoned and sometimes to be applauded, the divorce rate will skyrocket to new heights. And if people in high positions of public life, like Mrs. Roosevelt, discuss divorce without definite, repeated, and systematic warnings against this domestic evil, we may see that the number of shattered families in our country will approach the toppling figures in Russia before Soviet statesmen began to put legal brakes on the divorce machinery.

Mrs. Roosevelt and other magazine writers on this subject are, of course, entitled to their opinions; but when we read head-lines like this, "First Lady for Divorce if Incompatibility Is Issue," and then in an International News dispatch notice, "Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt was on the side of divorce advocates today," who can measure the disastrous potentialities that may arise from such statements? When the mistress of the White House tells the American people that she believes divorce to be "necessary and right" if husband and wife find that they cannot live happily together, she has done irreparable damage. Thousands of selfish, misguided young couples will read this pronouncement and immediately conclude that, if Mrs. Roosevelt is for divorce and if the Ladies' Home Journal, normally a conservative magazine, features this dissolution, it must be right, proper, fashionable, and modern.

Typical by his heavy applause is Gilbert Frankau, English novelist: "It is true there is more divorce since the war, but that is because there is less concealment of lost affection and more frank-ness. Now a wife who no longer loves her husband tells him so frankly, tells him she has more affection for some one else. Then there's a divorce, and she marries again, and that is the more honest way. And it's much better than carrying on deceit." (New York Evening Post, April 21, 1926.) Theodore Dreiser admits: "When I contemplate the Russian, as opposed to our own, marriage and divorce systems, I can only wish that the Russian system could apply." (Divorce, p. 50.) Lion Feuchtwanger, novelist banned from Germany, pictures the ideal state as issuing marriage contracts that must anticipate divorce. He explains: The state "would have to provide that in all circumstances marriage contracts should contain provision for the imminent possibility of a severance. These contracts would have to contain a clause stipulating that at the wish of either of the two contracting parties the contract must be severed without delay." (L.c., p. 90.) Arnold Bennett hails this as "an elasticity by which society will assuredly profit." His own prophecy regarding marital liberality one hundred years hence follows: "I am convinced that in 2035, if one or both of a married pair demand a dissolution of the bond after having ceased to live together conjugally for a prescribed period, the bond will be dissolved on the strength of that plea alone. Such a development, when the time comes, will be generally welcomed and approved." (Southtown Economist, March 1, 1936.)

Radical sociologists, of course, have hailed easy divorce as an essential blessing for modern married life. The late Havelock Ellis candidly declared: "The greater facility of divorce aids the formation of the most satisfactory unions." (Whither Mankind, p. 209.) Beatrice Forbes-Robertson Hale insists: "The divorce and remarriage of childless couples or of those whose children are grown is a private and, racially speaking, an insignificant affair." Bertrand Russell concludes: "To sum up, where there are no chil-dren, divorce should be obtainable at the request of either party. Where there are children, the usual ground should be mutual consent." (Divorce, p. 18.)

Even less radical sociologists glorify divorce. Dr. Paul J. Zentay, president of the Social Hygiene Association of Missouri, frankly told the members of the Saint Louis Hebrew Young Men's Association: "The best interests of partners in marriage are served if divorce is made easier. The only criterion of marriage is the willingness of two people to live together. The Russian experiment in liberalizing marriage laws, after the first burst of licentiousness, has resulted in more stability for monogamy than exists in America or England." (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 9, 1935.)

### WHAT IS WRONG WITH DIVORCE?

With the endorsement of legislators, and the support of liberal church-leaders, sociologists, and men of letters, increasing multitudes are asking, "Well, what is wrong with divorce? Why should not two people who are tired of living together have the privilege of living their own lives separately and apart? Why should a husband and a wife who are unhappily married be condemned to a life sentence of mutual misery? What," they repeat, "is wrong with divorce?"

Our answer must be quick and clear: "Everything is wrong with it." Few tragedies in human experience are as devastating as this judicial separation; for it strikes, first of all, at the heart of marriage and thus at the foundations of our civil well-being. If, as the Supreme Court of the United States has de-clared, "it [marriage] is an institution in the maintenance of which in its purity the public is deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the family and of society without which there would be neither civilization nor progress," then any trend or system which attacks this institution condemns itself as hostile to public and personal welfare. Indeed, if there is one lesson that stands out with prominence on the pages of universal history, it is this: Wherever the cancer of divorce remains unchecked, this malignant growth eats its way into the vitals of national existence. During the early years of Roman history this evil was quite unknown; but when the state was cursed with vice and the softness of easy prosperity, free divorce and the resultant license were so wide-spread that legal separations could be secured by the husband or wife who expressed the desire in writing. Disintegration of the Roman empire was just as inevitable as the decay that followed the debauchery of promiscuous divorce in Islam, Greece, Persia, Babylonia.

We in the United States will do well to remind ourselves that no nation has ever been stronger than its homes. With four million people divorced in our country (more than our entire population at the time of the Declaration of Independence), we must realize that the most dangerous menace to the nation's healthy progress is to be found not in the menace of foreign coalitions or in the secret development of instruments of mass annihilation, but in the termite destruction of divorce. This leaves the veneer of our much-vaunted culture undisturbed but eats away the pillars supporting the dome of our national decency until they become hollow props swaying uncertainly before the crash of inevitable collapse.

Divorce must, evoke resentment particularly because of its blight on the lives of children; and children are affected in four of every ten divorce decrees. All boys and girls born in the United States have certain claims which their parents must respect. They have a right to the warmth and comfort of a home, to mental and religious training, and, above all, love. When the specter of divorce enters a home, the children lose either father or mother, sometimes practically both. It has been estimated that there are in this country no fewer than 500,000 of these legal half-orphans, and any one who knows these unfortunate children understands that they rarely escape without a handicap in life.

That delinquencies in crime are often the products of divorce and separation is shown by sociological investigations. Dr. William F. Lorenz, chief of the Wisconsin Psychiatric Institute, learned that 52 per cent of the inmates of the Industrial Home for Wo-men, 50 per cent of the Industrial School for Girls, 41 per cent of those in the State Reformatory for Boys, 39 per cent in the Industrial Home for Boys, and 35 per cent in the State Reformatory came from broken homes. Forty-three out of every one hundred persons sentenced to Wisconsin penal and corrective institutions have lived in disrupted homes. (Chicago Tribune, October 4, 1926).

Ernest H. Shiller of the University of Chicago tabulated the home history of nearly 8,000 boys in reformatories and corrective institutions. More than 50 per cent of the detained boys came from broken families. This shows that incidence of delinquency is several hundred per cent greater for children of divorced parents than among normal youth. A two-year study of New York criminal records reveals that 47 per cent of those convicted of major crimes likewise came from disrupted families.

Dr. Frank L. Christian, superintendent of the Elmira, New York, Reformatory, classified the 1,500 inmates of this corrective institution in this way: "About 55 per cent of them came from homes broken by death, desertion, or divorce. The responsibility for family support fell on the remaining parent, usually the mother. Desertion, bitterness, and the loss of sympathetic understanding had destroyed discipline and made home a good place to get away from." (Chicago Tribune, October 5, 1926.)

During 1933 about 500 young men, drifting down-and-outers, job-seekers, and adventurers, daily passed through Des Moines, Iowa, on the long freight trains rumbling through the portal to the West. Fred Johnson, district special agent to the Great Western Railway, who studied these migrants, asserts that "75 per cent are youths who have been deprived of home-life through divorce and death." (New York Times, July 22, 1934.)

From a survey by a University of Pittsburgh sociology student it was learned that 50 per cent of all children haled before Pittsburgh courts for theft, immorality, property damage, and similar delinquency came from broken homes. This ratio becomes especially significant when we are told that 18 per cent of the Pittsburgh homes are disrupted.

"A great majority of the delinquent girls and boys who appear in juvenile court," declares Judge McNabb of the Fort Wayne Juvenile Court, "come from homes that have been broken, principally by desertion or divorce. Therein lie some of the greatest tragedies in life.... We see too many cases in which the man cares for another woman, his wife cares for another man, and neither of them cares for their children."

The composite description of the typical American criminal made by seasoned criminologists attending the 1936 International Association of Chiefs of Police starts in this way: "A lazy, vain, moderately educated city youth whose parents have separated." And these experts in crime conclude: Broken homes contribute the bulk of new recruits for crime's vast army.

The divorced wife pays the heaviest penalty. She who previously enjoyed her husband's support frequently finds herself in a financial dilemma, from which not even a grudgingly paid alimony can completely extricate her. We have instruments to measure many of the convulsive forces of nature; but human ingenuity will never devise any meter for gaging the suffering of the divorced woman whose home is a single room in a crowded lodging-house, whose battle for existence is waged in laundries, factories, or calloused business offices. Even in cases where the wife is the innocent party and the court awards her financial support, the divorce may carry a certain stigma with it, at least in many circles, and always involves new burdens and handicaps.

Though the salary of the divorced husband continues much as before, he, too, pays a high price for his freedom. This may be exacted in the payments of the alimony by which the law of the land compels him to maintain, partially at least, the financial provision of his marriage pledge; or he may pay in that approach to social ostracism by which society in the better circles of life protests against the violation of the marriage code; or he may suffer with the disillusionment and the spiritual impoverishment which often follow divorce. Sometimes this remorse and distress drive the divorced to suicide. Dr. Frederick L. Hoffman, insurance statistician, has furnished this comparative table for New York City showing the suicide ratio for married and divorced people of both sexes:

|          | Male  | Female |
| -------- | ----- | ------ |
| Married  | 34.1  | 15.0   |
| Divorced | 113.5 | 61.2   |

\The decidedly higher suicidal tendency of the divorced is apparent. Underneath the bravado of divorce there often linger the deep ache and the numb pain of despair.

In fact, our entire social structure is penalized by divorce, particularly because of the dishonesty and connivance with which it is all too frequently associated. With the prohibition amendment erased from our Constitution, no aspect of American legal life remains in which fraud flourishes as brazenly as in our divorce litigation. A husband assumes the guilt of an erring wife. Evidence is manufactured by professional divorce detectives. The divorce is prearranged by collusion outside of court and then secured on the basis of some technicality within the court. Nine out of every ten divorce suits are uncontested.

In McCall's for May, 1936, Attorney Richard A. Knight asserts that only about 2 per cent of the divorces granted under Nevada laws at Reno have legal validity, since the Supreme Court of Massachusetts has upheld the claim, as did the United States Supreme Court, that in a contested Reno divorce Massachusetts merely for divorce purposes, was a sham.

Divorce as an invitation to fraud and perjury is denounced by jurists who preside over domestic-relations courts. Listen to Judge William E. Hirt of Erie, Pennsylvania: "By far the largest number of decrees are granted on the charge of indignities. What is meant by such indignities the law does not define but depends largely upon the circumstances of each case, though it must consist in such a course of conduct as is humiliating, degrading, and inconsistent with a spouse's position and relation as such. This last ground especially opens the door rather wide to fraud in the courts. It is a rule of law that no divorce will be granted where there is collusion between the parties. But how is the court to know that collusion is not present since most of the divorce actions are prosecuted ex parte and are uncontested? I suspect in a large percentage of cases that the respondent is just as anxious for a decree as the complainant and is willing that the complainant, in his absence, exaggerate the facts relied on, to the point of producing the minimum of proof necessary for a decree. That there is exaggeration to the point of perjury is indicated by the fact that, where the respondent does appear and where both sides are heard, a decree is not often entered. But which grounds for divorce shall be recognized as valid is not of great importance so long as people want divorces and are willing to go the required lengths to secure them. In States where infidelity constitutes the sole recognized ground for divorce, we may believe, as is reported upon good authority, that in many cases, by collusion, circumstances are arranged in advance to give the appearance of the offense, to the degree required by legal standards of proof, when in fact the offense has not been committed at all."

### THE BIBLE ON DIVORCE

With these dire consequences the position of the Bible may be anticipated. Indeed, the fundamental charge which the Church hurls against divorce is this, that it runs directly counter to Christ's plain teachings. All other indictments, striking as they are, can be only secondary.

According to the divine attitude marriage can terminate in one, and only one, way without provoking God's displeasure. That way is indicated in the marriage pledge that promises faithfulness "until death you do part." When the Creator instituted matrimony, He made no provision for the separation of husband and wife, who are to "cleave together" (Gen. 2:24), an injunction wilfully violated by divorce. Marriage, according to divine ordinance, is indissoluble, a lifelong union. No matter how, why, or by whom the marriage relation is torn apart before death, either husband or wife has sinned and broken the permanency of that first blessed institution.

This is the evident teaching of our Lord. When tempting Pharisees put this direct question to Jesus: "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?" He ruled, after directing their attention to the divine institution of marriage, "What therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder" (Mark 10:9). After the Pharisees left and His disciples, harking back to the early Hebrew divorce procedure (conceded to the Israelites because of the hardness of their heart), again brought the question to the attention of the Savior, His second answer was even more direct and compre-hensive: "Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her. And' if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another, she committeth adultery" (Mark 10:11, 12). It must be incontrovertibly evident from these passages (the truth of which is regarded as so vital that it is repeated in Matt. 19:6 and Luke 16:18) that Jesus brands divorce as diametrically opposed to the divine will.

To impress us, the divine injunction "Let not man put asunder" is restated in the epistles. In Rom. 7:2 the separation by death is the only dissolution of the marriage relation; for the apostle says: "The woman which hath an husband is bound by the Law to her husband so long as he liveth." To add surety to surety, Scripture in 1 Cor. 7:39 again states in similar language: "The wife is bound by the Law as long as her husband liveth." A careful reading of these passages must remove every suggestion of doubt as to the Bible's attitude on divorce: it is branded as a sinful repudiation or evasion of the divine will.

Is there no exception to this comprehensive, sweeping rule "Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her"? There is; for in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5:31, 32), where Jesus describes the striking contrast between His mission and that of Moses, He speaks of divorce and says: "It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement. But I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery." This is not an isolated utterance; for the Savior repeats it in the fuller account of His questioning by the Pharisees, where He reasserts: "And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery" (Matt. 19:9). No argumentation, no juggling of the text, no recourse to the manuscripts, can change this plain statement: marital unfaithfulness breaks the marriage relation and may be cited by the innocent party as a reason for a divorce which God and the Church recognize.

While adultery is the only cause for divorce admitted by the Word of God, another provision is associated with this discussion. In 1 Cor. 7:15 St. Paul states pointedly: "If the unbelieving depart, let him depart; a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases." Applying this apostolic principle to our modern marriages, it becomes apparent that, when an unfaithful husband maliciously and permanently leaves his wife and will not return, this forsaking breaks the marriage relation. The deserted wife, according to the apostle's statement, "is not under bondage"; that is, she need no longer consider herself bound to her former husband and may have the courts declare this by granting a legal divorce, which the Church recognizes. This permission is not to be abused, nor are its provisions to be stretched so that they cover quarrels and misunderstandings in consequence of which the husband or wife leaves the home temporarily. The fact of wilful and absolute desertion with sinful intent must be established. When malicious forsaking is proved, it is interpreted by the Church as a breaking of the marriage relation and not merely a cause for which divorce may be secured before legal authority.

### ANTI-SCRIPTURAL ATTITUDES

The State has not felt itself restricted by these statements of Scripture. As a result the nation has a crazy-quilt of marriage and divorce laws. A man may be a good citizen in one State and a bigamist in another. South Carolina recognizes no ground for divorce, while New Hampshire permits divorce for fourteen different causes. The Bureau of Census tells us in a bulletin on marriage and divorce that the reasons for which divorces are granted in our country are the following: 1) adultery, 2) cruelty, 3) de-sertion, 4) drunkenness, 5) neglect to provide, 6) gross neglect, 7) vagrancy, 8) conviction of crime, 9) separation, 10) bigamy, 11) incompatibility, 12) fraudulent representation, 13) misconduct, 14) other minor causes.

In reality, of course, these "other minor causes" throw open the floodgates for trivial allegations. In one of the largest ladies' journals in our country a flaunting advertisement shows a bride and groom standing before the altar and pledging themselves "till breath do us part." Below the picture the readers are asked: "Is the time coming when halitosis (unpleasant breath) will be a legal ground for separation? We hope not. There are too many grounds now. Yet halitosis has already been listed as an act of 'extreme cruelty.' In another case, tried in the Chicago courts, it was set forth as the principal cause of a woman's unhappiness with her husband."

Equally repulsive and anti-Scriptural are the reasons collected by the editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, who annually releases an assortment of divorce causes as recorded in public print. He mentions divorces granted: "to a Minneapolis woman because her husband's bridge partner struck her when he bid seven spades and found she did not hold the ace; to a Chicago man because his wife broke over his head a shaving mug which had been in the family three generations; to an Evanston woman because her husband dated the dust on the bathroom mirror with his finger; to a Memphis man because his wife 'married him for spite'; to a Bridgeport (Conn.) woman because her husband forced her to sleep in a hen-coop; to a Chesterfield (Mo.) man because his wife married him on a bet and forced him to do the family washing; to a Kansas City (Kans.) woman because her husband showered her with orchids and Paris gowns when she wanted to wear gingham and rear a family."

Advocating the extreme opposite, the Roman Catholic Church emphatically forbids divorce for any reason. In the encyclical of Pius XI, dated January 8, 1931, the Catholic doctrine is restated, declaring that marriage carries with it "a perpetual and indissoluble bond, which cannot be dissolved by civil law." Opposing the modern trend for easy divorce, this document states, "stands the unalterable Law of God, fully confirmed by Christ, a law which can never be deprived of its force by the decrees of men, the ideas of a people, or the will of any legislators: "What God hath joined together let not man put asunder." In conformity with this the Roman Church has persistently refused to grant divorce for any reason. It does not recognize divorces acknowledged by other churches or by the law.

This position, of course, ignores and rejects the definite exceptions made by our Savior in the two distinct places, Matt. 5:31 and Matt. 19:9. It is the custom of Roman Catholic scholars, as also of many Episcopal interpreters, to assert that the qualifying remark in these two passages which permits divorce on account of fornication is a later addition to the New Testament text and not an integral part of the original revelation. This stand is unwarranted, and opens the door to other wilful emendations of the text.

### THE ANNULMENT ORGY

The difficulties into which the rejection of these plain Scriptural statements plunges the Catholic opposition to divorce may be seen in the subterfuges offered by the papal Rota. This court of Catholic appeal, consisting of twelve auditors and a presiding dean, issues decrees of ecclesiastic annulments and dispensations for remarriage. Some of these are fundamentally immoral and are mere substitutes for divorce. That they are so regarded may be seen in the statements of this candid cable dispatch from Paris to the New York World, dated August 5, 1923: "The divorce wave that is sweeping Europe, especially Paris, has even affected Catholics. Their religion forbids divorce, but many are obtaining declarations that their marriages never were valid because of canonically invalidating impediments. This is commonly called 'annulment.' So many have done this that the ecclesiastical court calendars at Rome have become clogged and Pope Pius has warned Cardinal Dubois here that new, more stringent restrictions will be made."

The case of the Duke of Marlborough and the former Consuelo Vanderbilt is illuminating. Both Episcopalians, they were married in St. Thomas's Church, New York, in 1895. For twenty-five years they lived together, and two children were born to them. The duchess obtained a divorce from her husband in 1920, and both married other persons. Desirous of becoming a member of the Catholic Church, the Duke went to Rome to have the first marriage annulled, claiming that this union was the result of duress. The Holy Rota Tribunal of the Vatican heard the case and substantiated a previous judgment of the Roman Church's diocesan court of Southwick, England, which had declared the first marriage null and void from the beginning. This decree in effect says that the Duke of Marlborough and his wife lived together for a quarter of a century not as husband and wife but in illegitimate union; it implies that the Rota Romana can break any nuptual pledge if it sees fit and that marriage contracts of Protestants need not be recognized. The protest of Bishop Manning, denouncing this annulment of a union contract thirty-one years after it had been made, will be supported by every unbiased American citizen: "The tribunal of the Rota at the Vatican, described as the supreme court in such matters, presumes to declare that an American marriage, valid, duly solemnized and recorded under our law, is void and that it never existed. This assumption of jurisdiction by a Vatican court has most serious implications and will be rightly resented by great numbers of our people. Our religious liberty in this country must be uncompromisingly defended against any such interference. This incident is a sharp reminder to those who love freedom of the importance of maintaining complete separation of Church and State. If marriages are to be declared null and void on pleas so unreal as this, no marriage and no home can be regarded as safe."

If this were an isolated incident, it might be explained as an unintentional error of the Rota, which according to its dean, Monsignor Massini, "must continue to listen to the requests also of non-Catholics because the Catholic Church is the mother of all souls redeemed by the precious blood of Christ" and which, on the same authority, "must be immaculate" (New York Times, October 2, 1927). But the Rota records contain other glaring incon-sistencies. Emma Eames, opera singer, was married to Julian Story; and Emelio De Gogorza, famous baritone, was married to a Jewess, Eliza Neumann, the ceremony having been performed by a New York magistrate. Later Miss Eames and De Gogorza, tiring of their marital bonds, wished to marry each other. Appeal was made to the Roman authorities, who declared that, since Mr. Story, the husband of Miss Eames, was not a Catholic, in the eyes of the Church they had not truly been married. Therefore, since De Go-gorza's wedding was a police-court ceremony, it was not recognized by the Church, and both of these marriages could be annulled when Miss Eames became a Catholic and married De Gogorza.

Quite parallel was the marital freedom extended to Marconi by "the Church that never divorces." A special copyright cable to the Chicago Daily News, November 24, 1926, featured this incredible report: "Senator Guglielmo Marconi, the radio inventor, is seeking ecclesiastical annulment of his marriage, it has been dis-closed, in connection with his audience with the Pope. Senator Marconi married the Honorable Beatrice O'Brien, daughter of the fourteenth Baron Inchiquin, in 1905 and was divorced from her in the civil courts a few years ago. Although both are Protestants, application was made recently to the Catholic curia of Westminster for annulment of marriage on the ground of defective legality. The annulment was provisionally granted. It is reported Senator Marconi desires to marry a woman in Rome whose name has not been disclosed. This would explain his desire to obtain an annulment of his former marriage, though he is a Protestant The technical reason for annulment of the marriage by the curia of Westminster was a condition agreed upon by the bridegroom at the insistence of the bride. This agreement was to the effect that the marriage should be dissolved if the couple were unable to agree."

When Mme. Maria Jeritza, opera singer, had to face the charge of her Austrian fellow-countrymen that her marriage to an American motion-picture director was "irregular," she answered pointedly: "I received the Catholic Church's approval of my second marriage. Born a Catholic, I became a Protestant to marry Baron Popper in Vienna in 1929 at a Protestant ceremony. That was ended by my Arkansas divorce, but I am still an Austrian citizen under the new Austrian law, and my Protestant marriage to the baron does not count. I returned to the Catholic Church to marry Mr. Sheehan, and competent church authorities assured me that all was regular."

These annulments may not justify the editorial comment that "marriage standards in Rome and Soviet Russia appear to be approaching a common plane"; but at least they show that the Roman doctrines of marriage are characterized by extreme flexibility. While this Church repudiates divorce, it just as insistently grants annulments, even under the most amazing circumstances.

In general it may be said that declarations of nullity are recognized by that Church, as Lynch (This Is Christian Marriage, p. 142 ff.) shows, when the prescribed Roman Catholic form of marriage is not observed; or when bride and groom were married against their will; or when they are married with conditions which that Church does not recognize; or finally, when the contracting parties were not free to marry, i.e., when they were within the forbidden degrees. In such cases Catholic or non-Catholics can appeal to the prescribed ecclesiastical authorities and finally even to the Rota for a declaration of nullity. This procedure means ultimately that all marriages performed by civil officiants or by non-Catholic clergymen may be declared altogether void (Lynch, l.c., p. 146) and that the parties to these annulled marriages are free to marry again.

The Scriptures make no specific provision for annulment; but the churches recognize all those nullifying legal procedures which are based on evident fraud or intimidation. It should be observed that annulments usually deal with premarriage conditions, while divorce concerns postmarriage reasons. For instance, when actual coercion has been employed in a ceremony performed at the point of a gun, when the evidence of concealed bigamy is shown, or when the marriage has united two who are within the forbidden degrees of relationship, these are not lawful, binding unions and may be revoked. This does not mean, however, that there can be any endorsement for the present wave of annulment, in which technical-ities, many of them premeditated, are seized upon months after the wedding to show the illegal nature of the ceremony. While the State has repeatedly granted annulments on the basis of age misrepresentation, the Church may not feel bound to recognize these revocations, particularly when they are palpably collusive attempts to break unpleasant marriage bonds. Judge Frank McDonough, Sr., of Denver protests against the many annulments following in the wake of gin marriages. Answering the petition of a Colorado young man twenty-one years old who claimed that he was too much intoxicated to know what he was doing when he married, Judge McDonough sounded a warning note: "If people voluntarily enter into a state of intoxication-and then in a careless manner go through a marriage ceremony, I just wonder if the law shouldn't leave them where they put themselves. Every time you dissolve a marriage of this type, you only encourage other people to go and do likewise." (New York Times, October 4, 1935.) However justifiable the grounds for annulment may be in such cases, once these are definitely known, the relationship of husband and wife must immediately cease if there is to be any legal nullification. Continued living together after the evidence of fraud or coercion precludes any possibility for later action.

### REMARRIAGE AFTER DIVORCE

A disturbing consequence of divorce has come into undeserved prominence. It is the multiple weddings of those who flippantly discard their husbands or wives to take a second chance or, in this age of extremes, even third or fourth chances. Our files not only reveal head-line after head-line recounting the divorce orgies of players on the stage and screen, but they also show a steadily rising tide of repeated marriages, well styled "progressive polygamy," among those in less intensely publicized walks of life. Some of these notorious contemporaries are not far at least from the spirit of the domestic debauches by Hassan Ibn Ali, the grandson of Mohammed, who rejoiced in the sobriquet "the Divorcer." The Persian Mirat-ul-Kainat summarizes his marital adventures thus: "During his father's lifetime he successively married ninety or one hundred ladies, and notwithstanding his extreme good nature divorced again, for trifling reasons, every one he had taken."

The Church's position on remarriage is definite. If a divorce has been granted because of fornication or on the basis of actual malicious desertion, the innocent party may enter a new marriage. The Church will of course try to secure a reconciliation, and in many cases the Christian husband or wife suffering from unfaithfulness and disloyalty is ready to forgive and refuses to take recourse to divorce. When children are involved, their good name makes a reconciliation highly advisable. But if in these cases the outraged party insists on a divorce, this must be granted and with it the privilege of remarriage. 1 Cor. 7:15 states that the deserted spouse "is not under bondage." The marriage tie is broken. The innocent husband or wive may remarry. And the words of Jesus in Matt. 19:9, "I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another committeth adultery," imply that if a man puts his wife away for fornication and then marries another, no condemnation attaches to his actions if he, as the innocent party, remarries.

On the guilty husband or wife (in divorces granted for adultery) certain restrictions are imposed for remarriage. Because the adulterous husband is still bound to his wife, if she will have him, he cannot, so the Scriptures imply, marry any one else as long as she is alive, not remarried, and willing to live with him again. If the innocent wife marries some one else, she has definitely shown her un-willingness, and the guilty spouse may remarry. If she dies, the erring husband is, of course, free. In other words, as long as the innocent party is unmarried and the possibility of reconciliation remains, a Christian pastor should not perform the remarriage of the guilty party.

In 1 Cor. 7:10, 11 the apostle speaks of malicious desertion and says: "Let not the wife depart from her husband. But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her hus-band." Here St. Paul first of all forbids this wicked forsaking and then declares that those who desert their husbands cannot marry some one else. They must "remain unmarried," although the apostle hopes that they will "be reconciled" to their husbands. Thus in the case of malicious desertion, too, the Church will not remarry the deserting party as long as the innocent spouse is alive and unmarried, and there is a possibility of reacceptance of the offender.

In the instance of church-members who have been divorced by a civil decree which the Scriptures do not recognize the Church takes a firm position in regard to their remarriage. In Matt. 5:32 the Savior, preaching on the mount, declares that "whosoever shall marry her that is divorced" (that is, divorced, as the preceding words show, without Scriptural sanction) "committeth adultery.' And in Matt. 19:9 Jesus asserts: "Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another com-mitteth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery." A concrete instance will help to illustrate these passages. For example, if a man and a woman are divorced by prearrangement and collusion, simply because they do not care to live with each other, they have first of all broken the marriage vow. If either one remarries or both of them, they have committed adultery, and those with whom they are living in this new relationship have also committed adultery. These individuals may have been legally divorced and legally remarried, they may live as husband and wife in the eyes of the law; but in the eyes of the Church they have broken the Sixth Commandment and are living in an illicit relation. They cannot be retained in church-membership if they persist in maintaining these objectionable relations. They must express their true repentance and normally show this by their willingness to dissolve the adulterous union.

In these questions of remarriage many complicated situations may arise. These intricate problem cases should be carefully examined and judged according to the statements of God's Word.

Legal loopholes in our divorce legislation make remarriage possible in practically all cases where the guilty party has money or influence; but no social or financial prestige can purchase exemptions from the demands of God's Law. The willingness of many clergymen to officiate at socially important marriages involving guilty husbands or wives has helped to increase the notorious multiple marriage careers and unfairly heaped disgrace on the Church as a whole.

Until American churches sternly set their face against this slump in ecclesiastical morals and many sectarian clergymen refuse to officiate at the nuptials of these multiple-chancers in marriage, there can be no successful check on indiscriminate divorce and re-marriage. Never before have the leaders of American Christendom been under more serious obligation to proclaim the indissolubility of the marriage vow, to restrict divorce to infidelity and malicious desertion; and never before has outward Christianity so dismally failed in a crisis.

These concise Scriptural regulations will find no sympathetic response among young people who view marriage as a chance or at best as a problematical uncertainty. They tell us that it is immoral to bind two people together when they realize that their affections have been misplaced or when love dies. They picture divorce as a remedy, caustic but necessary, for unhappy marriages. They glorify the new freedom and in the same breath charge the Church with strait-laced tyranny and indifference to the happiness of its members.

This is a libel upon the solicitous interest with which the Church regards the ultimate welfare of its children. When pointed but usually hypothetical questions are raised, asking whether the Church sentences to lifelong punishment the wives who have suffered from the brutality of inhuman husbands, we have always replied that, when the aggravation is so serious that a Christian wife cannot live with her unbelieving husband without suffering physical harm, endangering her life, being compelled to deny her Savior or suffering intolerable indignities, there may be, first of all, a temporary separation. This is not divorce; for both parties remain married and are not free to contract new alliances. Nor should such separation be adopted except as a last expedient, just as it should be terminated as soon as the provocative conditions have been removed, for example, as soon as a husband shows that he will not harm his wife. The Church does not give a carte-blanche recommendation of such separations; for too often they are merely impulsive selfish actions, and frequently they may be the prelude to a divorce which the Church cannot recognize.

Under given conditions the Church has held that, if separation proves futile and a drunken sot, for example, persists in beating his helpless wife and threatening her life, this brutality may produce a condition tantamount to malicious desertion.

### COMPANIONATE MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE

Notable for its advocacy of quick and easy divorce has been the agitation in recent years for companionate marriage.

This is a very definite theory. Its former high priest, Judge Benjamin Barr Lindsey, gives us this definition: "Companionate marriage is legal marriage, with legalized birth control and with the right to divorce by mutual consent for childless couples, without payment of alimony." (The Companionate Marriage, p. V.) Three factors are essential to its program: the dissemination of birth-control information, the establishment of divorce commissions, and the elimination or regulation of alimony payments. This program has been reduced to a series of legal proposals described by Mr. Lindsey in this synopsis: "Here is a brief outline of the three essential legislative enactments or bills I have in mind:

"1) A bill for an act to repeal the present stupid laws against birth-control clinics to carry on and give advice to married women, who might make use of the information or not, as they choose, leaving it to their personal judgment as to whether they should remain childless or not, and if so, how long. . ..

"2) A second bill to amend the laws relating to divorce. This bill would add a clause providing that, where couples are childless and where the efforts of the magistrate to bring about a reconcile-ment have failed and where the couple mutually desires a divorce, the divorce shall be granted without further expense or needless delay.' This would require no lawyer, no more than getting married requires a lawyer. A judge can marry people and by this law he could under the prescribed conditions unmarry them.

"3) A third bill to regulate the property status of the divorced. It would deal with the right of the wife to support and alimony. It would withhold or grant such support and alimony according to the conditions of the case. For instance, if a woman were in good health and able to work and to support herself, there would ordinarily be no alimony. — Such a bill might provide that the property rights of childless couples should, at the discretion of the court, ordinarily be the same as the property rights of single per-sons." (L. c., pp. 245, 246.)

In the final analysis little fundamental difference can be found between the companionate marriage and the trial marriage. However strenuous may be the protest against this identification, it is admitted that the two have certain features in common (I.c., p. VI) : "Both would normally avail themselves of birth control and divorce by mutual consent. Both would place a minimum of obstruction in the way of childless couples wishing a divorce. And both recognize the fact that, when men and women marry, they can never be perfectly certain that their marriage will turn out to be a permanent success." The distinction Lindsey makes between the two is that, while a trial marriage emphasizes the trial element and establishes the psychology of impermanence, the companionate marriage differs in the adjective and more strongly emphasizes the desirability of permanence, although always conceding a line of retreat.

Positive blessings, it is asserted, will result from this easy divorce. Companionate marriage, we are told, entirely removes the tragedies of loveless unions; for when both husband and wife realize that they are not compatible on several scores, the companionate relation may be ended by mutual consent without cumbersome formalities and prohibitive expenses. The couple simply appears before a special domestic-relations judge, and if he is unable to convince them of the advisability of staying together, the divorce follows, with the participants free to seek new fields of marital adventure.

This plan starts from the wrong principle. The bitterness of loveless marriage is to be averted before the wedding and not after. The days of courtship should form the trying and testing period when two young people become well acquainted. The procedure of the companionate theory would prove absurd in the ordinary affairs of every-day life, where no one is admitted to a responsible position without having presented credentials as to ability. Why, then, in the incomparably more personal issue of marriage should young people be told, in effect, that they can decide after the wedding whether they are well mated, and if not, that their relationship can easily be broken by recourse to a companionate divorce?

Volubly do the companionists assert that their mode of marriage is more honorable and less deceitful and that for this reason it will destroy the double standard in marriage, with one procedure open to the wealthy and the same legal loophole closed to the poor. Mr. Lindsey emphasizes this in the third paragraph of his preface: "My thought is that we should put an end to this hypocritical pretense under which we profess one thing and do another, that the companionate marriage, now largely monopolized by educated people who understand scientific contraception and who can employ skilled lawyers in the obtaining of collusive divorces, ought to be made legally and openly available to all people, particularly to the poor and socially unfit, who need it most."

All this is further evidence of twisted morality. Instead of thundering out their denunciation against prearranged divorce and birth control, particularly among cultured families, champions of companionism first condone these obnoxious evils and then insist that the poor and uneducated are entitled to employ the same sordid methods. If anything smacks of hypocrisy and collusion, it is this idea of entering a marriage relation, supposedly a permanent union, but which, as both participants well know, may be dissolved at the slightest mutual inclination.

The advocates of this companionate relation do not minimize the conflict between their claims and the demands of the Bible. Mr. Lindsey gives a good example of intellectual honesty to many modernist preachers when he admits: "I have been receiving a good many letters of late asking me how I reconcile some of the views I am expressing in this book with the Bible. I have one short and conclusive answer to that question. I don't reconcile it with the Bible. Moreover, I don't see why I should. Those of my views which are in accord with Holy Writ speak for themselves. Those which are not have to be classed with evolution, the roundness of the earth, and other matters which were not factors in the speculative thought of the ancient Jews. To say that modern sociology must deal with modern facts is not to flout or discount the Bible. It is to interpret that book in the corrective light of changing conditions." (L. c., p. 323.)

For the Christian this admission invalidates the entire theory. The Bible condemns birth control as popularly understood; companionate marriage endorses it. The Bible denounces divorce and restricts its occurrence; companionate marriage champions divorce and advocates recourse to its emancipation. The Bible upholds the lifelong union of one man and one woman through sunshine and sorrow as God's ideal; companionate marriage offers a series of temporary unions, "until convenience do you part." As every plan that violates God's institution cultivates dangerous trends, so the spread of the companionate-marriage idea will promote debacle. It degrades marriage, breaks down the sanctity of the home, legalizes the violations of the marriage union, minimizes or destroys the blessings of family life, and grips our national wellbeing in a stranglehold.

The last argument in the Church's case against companionism finds in this overriding of marriage institutions only the first step in a program of revolt. After The Companionate Marriage's 395 pages of gratuitous vulgarity and innuendo the yellow journalistic style of Lindsey's collaborator, Wainwright Evans, comes to a significant climax on the last page. Lindsey admits that what he demands is but a minimum, and he concludes: "I am not asking much. These are the foot-hills of achievement. Beyond lie the mountains." The thoughtful reader asks: "What mountains?" If easy, quick, and repeated divorce, indoctrinated birth control, degradation of wifehood, — if these be but the foot-hills, can the mountains be anything else than the heights of free love, unmarried unions, and the debauch of animal lust?

Like other fads, this has run its course, and after a decade the agitation for its enactment is silently slipping away. How-ever, we cannot eliminate the discussion of companionism under the claim that it is outmoded after a few years of spectacular notoriety. While campaigning for election to the Superior Court of California, Lindsey was confronted by opposing slogans that appealed: "Defeat Lindsey and free love!" Probably more than political prudence directed him to declare: "Companionate marriage is a dead issue, which I dislike discussing since it has been thoroughly misunderstood and is apparently unexplainable." (Time Letters Supplement, July 23, 1934.) For certainly there is a genuine ring in the statement he issued almost a year later (March 18, 1935), declaring: "I am supposed to be an advanced thinker in this field, but nevertheless I am for a good old-fashioned marriage until death do us part. The problem is to get it that way. I believe our grandparents were happier and spiritually more successful than we are."

Yet while the support has subsided, the theory lingers, because companionism, regardless of the name it may assume, is endorsed by growing numbers. Judge Lindsey declares: "Companionate marriage is already an established social fact in this country. It is conventionally respectable. Sophisticated people are, without incurring social reproach, everywhere practicing birth control and are also obtaining collusive divorce, outside the law, whenever they want it. They will continue to practice, and no amount of prohibitive legislation can stop them." (The Companionate Marriage, p. V.)

### ANTIDOTES TO DIVORCE

The reduction of the divorce rate has been the object of prolonged concern. Even those not moved by religious convictions recognize this sabotage of American morals and have sought effective remedies. These cures have frequently stressed the physical side and found the cause for divorce in such evidently remote defects as flat feet. Others have taken the psychological approach and have featured away-from-the-husband or away-from-the-wife vacations, moratoria on family meals, the maintenance of separate residences, and similar arrangements designed to provide regular furloughs from married life and prevent monotony. At the same time much counsel for the more practical issues of married life has been published in late years.

In keeping with the social-study trends of our day, however, the fundamental, character-building contributions of true Christianity and the emphasis on Scriptural marriage ideals have been ignored. Yet these principles offer the only powerful antidote to the divorce orgy. Christians know that divorce, far from being a convenient exit from the consequences of faulty judgment, is a heinous crime in the sight of their God and in its effects upon their fellow-men. Instead of minimizing the necessity of painstaking care in the choice of a life companion, they, believing that for God's children marriages are made in heaven, still should be guided by intelligent selection. They refuse to risk the happiness of a lifetime on the impulses of a fortnight's courtship. They deny that true love is blind.

When these high-souled ideals are supplemented by a married life in which spiritual claims are not disregarded, the possibilities of permanent misunderstanding are remote. If Christ rules, divorce remains a distant, ugly Caliban. Judge John Rooney of the Chicago Court of Domestic Relations has stated "that three out of four domestic troubles that have come before him have been the result of the neglect of either husband or wife or both to attend any church services." It has been shown that most Christians stay away from divorce tribunals. They are guided by the spirit of Christian forbearance, the willingness to sacrifice, and the readiness to find the best possible interpretation for all actions. They have the comradeship of their Savior, the direction of His Word, the strength of prayet, and the support of the Sacraments.

Convincing evidence of Christian faith and life as a divorce antidote is found in John A. Goodwin's The Pilgrim Republic (p. 596.) Here the following divorces are listed:

1661 Elizabeth Burge was divorced from Thomas, Jr., on Scriptural grounds.
1668 William Tubbs, of Scituate, was granted a divorce from Mercy Sprague, she having eloped trom the colony.
1663 Ensign John Williams of Barnstable was fined ten pounds for slandering his wife, Sarah, and John Bayley; but ten years later was granted a divorce on Scriptural grounds.
1675 Edward Jenkins of Taunton petitioned that his daughter Mary be divorced from Marmaduke Atkinson, who had been out of the colony for seven years. The decision was a singular one, namely, that, while the court "sees no cause to grant a divorce, yet they do apprehend her to be no longer bound, but do leave her to her liberty to marry if she please."
1680 Elizabeth Wade was regularly divorced from Thomas Stevens for his bigamy.
1686 John Glover of Barnstable was divorced from Mary for Scriptural cause.

Goodwin then concludes: "These six cases include all the divorces granted during the Colony's existence." Between 1620 and 1691 the Plymouth Colony, with a population that grew into the thou-sands, recorded only these divorces, each one granted on grounds of patent immorality or desertion. The sturdy Christian character of these pioneers expressed itself in firm family ties.

If the dynamics of Christian faith, coupled with the same kind of common sense and caution exerted otherwise in important contract obligations, were applied before and after the ceremony, the vast majority of divorces would never occur. The residue, caused by that cropping out of human nature which persists despite all scientific advancement, could be dealt with in an effective and stigmatizing manner.
