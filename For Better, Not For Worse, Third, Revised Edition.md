# A Manual of Christian Matrimony

Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. - Col. 3:17

## Preface

When [[Vera Britain]], in her [[Testament of Youth]] (a volume which stirred at least one university campus "as no other book in recent years"), admits that, while fifteen years ago she would have turned to a prayer-book for solace in the bereavement of her fiancé, today she would find comfort in Bertrand Russell's philosophies, her confession typifies the wide revolt against the morality of our Christian faith.

The following pages have been written to record a protest against this growing disparagement of Scriptural ethics and to help stem the onrushing tide which champions the pagan, despiritualized interpretation of courtship, mar-riage, and family relations.

We find a host of counselors today who "look at marriage." The doctor, the psychologist, the psychiatrist, the psychoanalyst, the biologist, the anthropologist, the sociologist, the Communist, the radical novelist, the Hollywood strategist — all have beheld marriage with a professional scrutiny; but they have given no trustworthy direction for the attainment of genuine and permanent marital happiness. Too often their overemphasis of the physical, their bias, skepticism, or venom, have remained utterly un-disguised.

More than ever before, then, the Church must look at marriage and in the spirit of its Lord and Savior offer as the basis for all family felicity the truths of divine revelation found within the covers of our Bible. The application of Biblical principles is not only highly concordant with the best results of sociological research, but has been demonstrated in unnumbered homes; for our Christian faith, with its eminently practical endowments, bestows those definite helps for the attainment of the higher happiness in married life: the presence of the redeeming Christ and His renewing Spirit, the strength of His purifying Word, the power of His sustaining Sacrament, and His pledge of answered prayer.

This volume is essentially a code of Christian mar-riage, drawn from the Scriptures, which would help to make marriage "for better, not for worse"; and it is offered particularly to the mature young people of the Christian Church, those alert, eager young men and women who after their high-school or college years may find themselves confronted by some of the problems which these pages would help solve. For fifteen years it has been my privilege to edit the Walther League Messenger, the young people's organ of my Church. Many of the personal questions that have been repeatedly voiced in the extended editorial correspondence of this decade and a half have not only suggested this volume, but have also helped to formulate its presentation. From contact with youth groups throughout the land, from private consultation with students, and from personal inquiries that have been submitted in connection with chain broadcasts I believe that the problems discussed in these chapters are among the major perplexities which confront our young people, and I have endeavored to give the Church's answer in a non-technical, practical manner.

Sometimes, it seems, the study of marriage is restricted to snatched bits of hazy theories or guided by conventions and eclipsed by absorbing, but momentary issues. In other, less complicated days, when Christian marital ideals were uncontested, this neglect may have produced no serious consequences; but today, when every major claim for Christian morality has been fiercely assailed, ignorance of the Scriptural injunctions and disregard of Christ's sustaining power become doubly hazardous. I am convinced that in the broad educational outlines for young people there should be adequate room for the constructive study of marriage blessings and problems. For what is young woman profited if she cn speak authoritatively on Byzantine art, yet has no definite understanding of the high principles of Christian home-life? Or what advantage does a young man enjoy who can quote Homer and Vergil in the original and still is woefully unprepared for the personal issues of the family? The increasing frequency with which courses on marriage appear in the curricula of American colleges shows that even worldly wisdom has been aroused to the necessity of premarital preparation. But since the Church offers more than academic information when it presents the divine will and the help of Heaven, its guidance along the pathway to domestic happiness is doubly im-perative. The future of our Church and of our country depends, under God, upon stalwart, Christian homes, consecrated Christian families, the exaltation of the Christian doctrines concerning marriage, parenthood, and home. And how can these truths be more effectively inculcated than by a systematic program, designed to make these truths vital, decisive forces in the hearts and lives of our young people?

I gratefully acknowledge the assistance rendered by two members of the Concordia Seminary Faculty, Prof. Th. Engelder, D. D., and Prof. E. J. Friedrich, who read the book in manuscript and offered helpful suggestions and improvements. Pastor Alfred Doerffler reviewed the manu-script, and Miss Harriet Schwenk offered generous assistance in the preparation for printing. The cooperation of Concordia Publishing House deserves recognition.

To the pastors who have answered questionnaires and to all those whose opinions have been sought and generously given I herewith extend my thanks.

I ask no greater blessing for these pages than that, by the grace of God, they may lead some of tomorrow's fathers and mothers to resolve in their marital relations that whatsoever they do in word or deed they "do all in the name of the Lord Jesus."

## Preface to the Third Edition

It has been a distinct pleasure to be able to prepare these pages for the third time. The entire book is reworked.

The presentation is frequently expanded and in some cases emphasized; much new material has been added as additional illustration; wherever possible, the references have been brought up to date.

So that the new edition would not become appreciably larger, some of the material of the previous printings has been condensed.

Comments from readers are particularly welcome.

We ask God to bless the new edition, so that it may help bring Christ into many homes and assist our young people in planning their married lives for better with Him, instead of for worse without Him!

## The Code of Christian Marriage Ethics

### The Church Submits a Marriage Code

Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord – Luke 1:6

"Is marriage worth while?" "Dare we hope for permanent happiness after the honeymoon?"

"How can we help to build a home partnership in which love, camaraderie, and mutual respect will be sustained?"

"Is wedded bliss, the theme on which the serene minds of yesteryear lingered lovingly, an outworn delusion?"

These are questions which keen-minded youth has insistently asked in our days of sagging domestic morals. Surrounded by discouraging influences, - frequent divorce, marital unfaithfulness, many unhappy marriages, and the rankling bitterness of domestic discord, - young men and women pause in survey; and their reaction often betrays a degree of hesitation and uncertainty.

Young people are assaulted by a ridicule of matrimony; they are barraged by appeals for a revolt against marriage; they hear catch-phrases promising a new freedom for a new age. the radio, the stage, the screen, — this quadruple alliance which often helps mold their thoughts, — are often confederated in attacking home ideals. And youth cannot altogether escape the impact of newspaper head-lines nor the panderings of erotic novels, which, banned by a wiser generation, are now offered in unexpurgated editions at a few pennies for daily rentals.

#### YOUTH CONSULTS ITS COUNSELORS

Bewildered young people are putting their questions concerning marriage in the present social order to a host of highly reputed counselors. They have turned to sociologists and demanded a workable code for courtship and married life, achievable principles by which the dreams of romance can be woven into the firmer texture of happy reality; but they have found that Harry Barnes and Havelock Ellis, Schmalhausen and Calverton, and other radicals have advocated extremes which stand self-condemned.

They remember the emphasis which the past years laid upon the physical side of marriage, and they hear persuasive voices arguing that physiologists and biologists can outline a clear course to avoid domestic disruption. But with life now concealing few mysteries for our young people, they must come to the realization that a mere knowledge of the body and its functions cannot provide any degree of stability for the inner life.

They have investigated the claims of psychoanalysis, only to conclude that Freudian psychology reduces emotional and spiritual life to a sensual basis.

The faddists of the hour have bid for their support, and youth watches the legislative and congressional battles in behalf of birth control with unusual interest; yet in their hearts they know that Mrs. Sanger's system is anything but the open-sesame to marital enchantment.

With six times as many students enrolled in our colleges as in 1900, the intellectual leaders of tomorrow's America have directed their inquiries to the wisdom enthroned on college campuses. The repeated answers of university radicalism show that the ideals of our intelligentsia are often surcharged with the liberalism of free love.

The promises of radical Socialism have recruited sizable brigades from an anticapitalistic youth; but Marxism, as it betrays its true identity in the debacle of Sovietism, is revealed as a bleeding delusion.

Professional counselors of the home — and their number is legion — have been approached in this quest of final truth; but too often their theories lead to the quicksands.

Youth has stood face to face with its parents and elders, the divinely constituted mentors of their morality; but with their own disheartening example twentieth-century fathers and mothers have often handed their children the stones of stolid indifference or the scorpions of cynicism.

Disillusioned, they have sought the solution of their problems by taking counsel with themselves. Yet at the First American Youth Congress, held at New York University, August 15—17, 1934, the more conservative element at this convention was radical enough to adopt an official platform declaring birth control desirable from a special point of view and asking for divorce by mutual consent. (Report, p. 17.)

In a final appeal, enlightenment has been sought at the altar of God. Youth has knocked at the doors of the Church and said: "In the name of religion tell us, Is marriage worth while?" "Where can we realize our ideals?" "How are we to lay lasting home foundations?" The replies are bewildering; for an ominous list of divorces among the clergy, the attacks on marriage from liberal pulpits, the degradation of wedded life by groups for whom marriage is a less holy and desirable state, have combined to emphasize that even the last prop, religion, has often given way.

Not all religion, however; for as youth stands at the cross-roads, Christ's code insists that every pale of pessimism be removed; that we must have done with the carping against marriage. As youth in this second quarter of the twentieth century, analytical in its judgments, challenging its discussions, repeats its questions and demands: "Is the joy of marriage mere myth? If not, how can we find its full happiness?" it becomes the sacred duty of the Church of Jesus Christ to speak with divine authority. Conscious of its everlasting truth it must answer these questions definitely and with constructive solution. It must ceaselessly declare: Holy wedlock, when appraised in the light of Christ's estimate and regulated by His code of marital ethics, is still one of the highest and holiest of all earthly joys.

#### THE CHURCH'S MARRIAGE CODE

What are these Christian pronouncements on marriage? A large library of conflicting interpretations clamors for recogni-tion; but if the clear statements of the Scriptures are accepted, the code which the Church gives its young people demands the definite endorsement of these basic truths:

1.  Marriage is a divine institution, established by God Him-self. It is not a social evolution or a heritage from any alleged brute ancestry. As the gift of God, sex, marriage, and family life are holy; and even though disfigured by sin, they should be honored by all men as divine bestowals.
2.  Christian marriage is a blessed ordinance, which leads to multiplied benedictions both for those in wedlock and for the race in general. Faithfulness to its requirements, under God, promotes individual and national well-being and progress.
3.  Marriage is ultimately the normal state for most people. To exalt intentional abstinence from marriage as more holy and God-pleasing, wilfully to spurn wedded life in the pursuit of self-centered ambitions, is to contradict God's wisdom.

4) Christian marriage is monogamous, the union of one man and one woman. Forsaking all others, the Christian husband and wife are to cleave only and always to each other.
5) Christian marriage is established only by free will and mutual consent. Christian children must not be forced to marry any one whom they cannot love. Yet young people are bound to consult their parents and to respect their advice, provided this does not overrule divine will.

6.  The marriage union is lifelong, and termination, except by death, always involves a transgression of the divine Law by either husband or wife or both. Divorce is permitted only in the case of marital unfaithfulness. Malicious desertion breaks the marriage relation.
7.  In the choice of a companion for life the decisive factor should not be wealth, physical attraction, higher education, and social position, but common devotion to the one Lord and Savior, the harmony of religious oneness. With the exception of the close degrees of relationship within which a Christian may not marry, there are no restrictions in the choice of husband or wife. A general compatibility of age, culture, and race is normally essential for sustained happiness.
8.  In the Christian family the husband is the representative head before God and man; the wife is the helping companion. The sphere of her highest activity is the home.
9.  An avowed purpose of Christian matrimony is the procreation of children. Where this first injunction, "Be fruitful and multiply," is wilfully disregarded and artificial means are employed to evade the responsibilities and privileges of parenthood, the full blessings of marriage will be sacrificed.
10. Christian marriage must have a spiritual basis in the reverent acknowledgment of Jesus Christ, the Savior of all men, and in the abiding presence of His comforting and sustaining Spirit. The family altar is to be the effective pledge against shattered promises and broken hearts.
11. Christian marriage must be marked by an intensity of self-sacrificing love. Wedded life characterized by frigid aloofness is not only greatly displeasing to God, but also soon becomes a caricature of the true conjugal devotion.
12. To prepare themselves for these blessings and to meet these high requirements, young people should ask the help of God in leading clean, courageous lives and avoiding all concessions to impurity. Sin poisons their happiness and will rise up later as a specter of reproach. Only after a careful and prayerful selection of the future helpmate, when all uncertainty has disappeared, should the mutual promise be given in engagement.

These principles are the foundation upon which young people should enter marriage and build their homes. Remove any one of these specifications, and an essential element of happiness is sacrificed. True, every statement in this marriage code has been fiercely attacked, hotly denied, mercilessly criticized, or serenely disregarded by our modern sophistication. Attempts to amend and to broaden are being made every day; but the only standards that have been weighed without being found wanting and that prove their abiding power even in the swift rush of the passing moment are God's ordinances.

The following pages seek to describe the constructive contributions which Christianity makes to married happiness. They have been written from the basic conviction that the mounting marital perplexities of our day can find solution only in remedies that conform to Christ's teachings. The remarkable harmony which exists between these principles and reliable social data will receive conspicuous attention. Contradictory, antichristian influences will be discussed and rejected. And with this double appeal — a plea for an appreciation of matrimony, from both the Christian and the social point of view — youth is asked to look at marriage and, revaluating its sacredness and blessing, to discover the tried and true pathway to individual and family happiness.

### TRIED AND TESTED

Behold, I make all things new – Rev. 21:5

This code is practicable. Its provisions are no hazy generalities, incapable of application. The history of matrimony offers continued demonstrations by which the power of Christ-inspired ideals may be measured. Particularly convincing are the radical changes in marital standards during the transition from paganism to Christianity in the cradle days of the Church.

Roman historians have left sordid pictures of the degeneracy into which domestic relations dropped during the softness and luxury of the empire. The perversions openly practiced were so revolting that St. Paul, in his letter to the congregation at Rome, can speak only broadly of these unnatural lusts. Yet it is possible to measure that wantonness by other standards which permit discussion. Divorce steadily became more frequent and was granted on trivial claims. Seneca's soliloquy is frequently quoted: "Does any woman now blush on account of a divorce, since the time when certain distinguished women of noble family reckoned their years not by the number of the [annual] consuls, but by that of their husbands and go forth [from their husbands] for the sake of being married, and married for the sake of being divorced?

Modesty is a demonstration of deformity." (De Benef., III:16.) Juvenal, flinging his barbed sarcasm against a woman who habitually remarried before the previous nuptial garlands were faded, concludes: "So the number [of husbands] increases; so eight husbands have become hers in five autumns, a worthy fact for the inscription on her tomb." (Satires, VI: 227-30.) Martial recorded the almost unbelievable experience of one Thelesina, who married her tenth husband within less than a month. (Epigrams, VI:7.)

The zest for licentiousness was shown by the sneering avoidance of marriage ties. Augustus placed heavy taxes on those who refused to enter matrimony; but legislation could not check debauchery. Wives were interchanged. The austere Cato honored his friend Hortensius by giving him his wife and then marrying her again after Hortensius died. Wives were borrowed or lent. Daughters of patrician lineage became professional devotees of lust, and in such numbers that the senate passed resolutions disenfranchising them. Sanctuaries dedicated to the worship of the gods, particularly of Isis, were transformed into dens of vice. A contemporary observer declares that the temple officials of his day saw more debauchery than those who made their livelihood from immorality.

The curse placed on childhood was one of the most frightful barbarities. Cicero indicts those who assert that the death of a child "is to be borne with an undisturbed mind; that, if indeed an infant in the cradle dies, there is to be no complaint whatever." (Tusc. Disp., I:39.) This unconcern darkens to an uglier hue in the case of crippled or deformed infants. Seneca maintains: "We destroy rabid dogs, we kill the fierce and unmanageable ox, and on sick sheep we let the iron drive lest they should infect the flock; we deprive of life unnatural offspring; likewise we drown children if they are born disabled and monstrous. It is not wrath, but reason, to separate things useless from those that are sound." (De Ira, I: 15.) The brutality practiced against unwanted children was exposure, which left new-born infants victims of wild beasts and vultures, or murder, which crushed and strangled them to death. One of the best-known of the many intimate letters discovered among the papyri is an autograph missive from Egypt in which Hilarion demands of his wife, Alis, that, if the child which they expect proves to be a girl, she must destroy it at once. Tertullian raises his voice against his heathen contemporaries: "How many among you, even in the magistracy, destroy your children! You drown them or expose them to die of cold or hunger or to be eaten by the dogs!"

#### THE TEST OF CHRISTIAN MARITAL MORALITY

Here, then, was a testing-ground where the power of the Christian morality could be gaged. With no social prestige, no political influence, no popular support in their behalf, Christian standards achieved the most radical revolution in morals that history has ever seen. Women were torn from the clutches of sensuality. "What women these Christians have!" exclaimed Libanius, the pagan teacher of Chrysostom. In the ennobling influences exerted by Anthusa on Chrysostom, Monica on Augustine, as well as by less known Christian mothers on their families a new womanhood and a glorified motherhood arose.

Matrimony itself was dignified by the Christian doctrine of its holiness, its blessing, its permanence. Children, exalted by the precepts and examples of Jesus, could no longer be exposed or murdered; they were welcomed with a new love and guarded as divine heritages. "Christians," admits an early writer whose identity has been lost, "take part in everything as citizens and submit to everything as strangers. Every strange land is native to them, and every native land is strange. They marry and have children like every one else, — but they do not expose their children. They have meals in common, but not wives. They are in the flesh, but they do not live after the flesh." (Auctor ad Diognetum, pp. 5, 6, in T.R. Glover, The Conflict of Religions in the Early Roman Empire.)

In short, out of the decay of a heathen society, steeped in its own vice, came a Christian code of marital ethics by which all subsequent progress has been regulated. While imperial legislation, framed to curb licentiousness, failed, the impulses radiated by a persecuted Christianity brought about the dawn of a happier day in the morals of marriage.

These refining powers of early Christianity have been challenged only by a few eccentric atheists. In his hot-headed attack on Christianity, entitled Has Religion Made Useful Contributions to Civilization? (p. 7 ff.), Bertrand Russell sinks to these depths: "The worst feature of the Christian religion, however, is its attitude toward sex, an attitude so morbid and so unnatural that it can be understood only when taken in relation to the sickness of the civilized world at the time when the Roman Empire was decaying. We sometimes hear talk to the effect that Christianity improved the status of women. This is one of the grossest perversions of history that it is possible to make." But history remains history, Russell notwithstanding. Only bigotry can fly into the face of facts.

#### THE DEMONSTRATION CONTINUES

The purifying power of the Gospel is shown in the chapters of modern missionary history. A section of Dr. Keyser's book on the Lutheran missions in New Guinea, translated in the Lutheran Standard (June 17, 1933), pictures in distressing detail the burden-bearing of native women there and continues: "The fact is that Christianity has given the Papuan women a vast freedom. Before God and in the Church they are on a par with the men; and their standing in society has likewise been raised very greatly. When men from neighboring villages came to visit, they were most deeply impressed with the respect and courtesy which the Christian women enjoyed. In genuinely heathen fashion they 'ran down' their own wives. 'They are not worth a shot of gunpowder? But they praised the Christian women: 'They are diligent, clean, faithful?

"One heathen whose wife had died tried his best to obtain a widow from a near-by Christian clan, who herself had not yet been baptized. He offered twice, yes, three times the amount of the regular price, but did not receive her in spite of all his efforts. ... A comparison of present-day social conditions among the Kate and Hube tribes with those obtaining during the time of paganism reveals the astounding progress that has been made in every direction. Everywhere it becomes evident that womanhood has been lifted to a much higher plane — a fruit of Christianity."

Probably 40,000,000 women in India are the secluded inmates of the zenanas (the private, restricted quarters of the women) ; 27,000,000 are destitute widows, with shaved heads and coarse garments, who do penance for an imaginary sin; 288 women out of every 10,000 of the total population of India are dancing-girls or priestesses, who live lives of prostitution in the temples. (R. H. Glover, The Progress of World-wide Missions, p. 112.) All doctrines and rituals of hoary creeds have not been able to relieve the multiform misery that shackles India's wives and mothers. Only the purifying teaching of Christianity can produce a Pandita Ramabai (one of India's greatest women, a convert to Christianity, who championed the cause of her caste-ridden sisters) or that new type of womanhood which towers over the pretenses of paganism wherever the recreating power of Christ's Gospel is exerted.

#### BEFORE OUR EYES

The demonstration of these Christian dynamics is also decisive in our own country. In the matter of divorce, for example, statistical material shows the effective power of the Church. George Walter Fiske, professor of religious education, Graduate School of The-ology, Oberlin College, in The Christian Family, presents this significant survey (pp. 33,34): "The writer has gathered data from sixty-one parishes in fifteen States in different parts of the country covering the family histories of 22,001 churchgoing white families, including 16,940 communicant families. The ministers reporting these cases were known to the writer as men of high standing and long service in the ministry, mostly in long pastorates, with a reputation for pastoral faithfulness. They know their people and the family histories of their people. We may accept their testimony as fairly accurate when they report that they can find only 196 cases of divorce among all these families, which is only one divorce to 113 marriages. And of this number only 117 divorces were among church-members or where either husband or wife was a church-member. This makes one divorce in 145 Protestant church-member families, or two thirds of 1 per cent. To allow for a wide margin of error in our data, multiply by two, and even then it is quite safe to say that less than 2 per cent of church-attending white families in America, and perhaps 1 per cent of communicant families, are ever divorced. These data give us two significant facts: Divorces in America are mostly among non-religious people. And religion, the Christian religion, is our best possible insurance against divorce."

Professor Fiske's claims are supported by other convincing testimony. Judge Carl V. Weygant of Cleveland, speaking to the Marriage and Home Conference in that city, showed that of the 7,000 cases which had come before his court only an insignificant number were church-members. (Homiletical Review, 1932, p. 132.)

Dr. Z. Barney Phillip, rector of Epiphany Episcopal Church of Washington, D.C., told the Conference on the Conservation of Home Life that of the 2,000 couples he had married in twenty-five years of his ministry only seven had sought divorce.

An investigation undertaken by the Lutheran, national weekly organ of the United Lutheran Church, showed on the basis of 527 replies to a questionnaire that of 68,559 marriage ceremonies only 1,073 ended in divorce. This suggests a ratio of one divorce to more than sixty marriages and shows that the church weddings are broken with only one tenth the frequency of our national divorce rate. The editor concludes: "The data gathered seem to indicate that, where young people's entrance into matrimony is by way of meeting one another on such decent and orderly occasions as the church furnishes and when their knowledge of the marriage covenant has been gained in catechetical classes and among religious folk, they generally stay married. They do not go to the divorce courts except for due cause." (New York Times, March 7, 1927.)

Even more extensive was the survey conducted by the Protestant Episcopal Joint Commission to Study the Whole Problem of Divorce — Its Conditions and Causes. A questionnaire submitted to groups of 800 selected ministers in the Episcopal, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Congregational churches brought interesting tabulations like these:

Of the 787 Episcopal clergymen reporting 77 percent did not recall a single divorce, 10 per cent more reporting only one; altogether, 346 divorces were enumerated.

Of the 520 Congregational clergymen 82.8 percent listed no divorces.

Of the 694 Presbyterian churches responding 83 percent mentioned no divorce. In 92 per cent there was but one divorce or less, where both the husband and wife attended church regularly.

Of 682 Baptist ministers 84.3 per cent could recall no divorce, and 7.6 percent recorded but one.

Of the Methodist churches 88.2 per cent reported no divorces, while 5.7 percent listed but one divorce among the regular church attendants.

#### A DECISIVE DEMONSTRATION

A marriage questionnaire was sent to a representative group of pastors in my own Church. Two hundred replies were received from various sections of the country and Canada, from rural and urban groups, small missions and large churches, wealthy congregations and poor, churches which employ only the English language and others that feature services in foreign languages. In this way a typical, cross-sectional view was obtained from approximately 5 per cent of the entire pastorate.

The answers revealed that 87 percent of these churches had not a single case of divorce during the year 1933. In the few churches reporting divorces the most prevalent domestic discord occurred in families in which only husband or wife was a member of the Church or in which both were indifferent members. Altogether these 200 pastors married 1,900 couples during the year 1933. For the same time they reported 37 divorces, making the divorce ratio in these 200 typical congregations 1 to 51 instead of the prevalent rate for the entire country, 1 to approximately 6. But of these 37 divorces only 14 were granted in which both husband and wife were members of the Church; and some of these 14 couples were indifferent church attendants.

In some of these divorces the Christian faith worked successfully for the reconciliation of the estranged parties. A New Or-leans magistrate, a non-Lutheran, is quoted to this effect: "I have found that very few Lutheran people ever get into the divorce court, and when they do, they are more easily handled if it comes to a question of reconciliation than any other cases of my experience."

Supplementary statements on the communications from these clergymen present illuminating comment like this:

"In the twenty-four years that I have been pastor here in Buffalo I have performed 202 marriages. In all these years but one couple has been divorced, and there has been only one separation. Of these two couples, in one instance the wife, in the other instance the husband, None of any member of the congregation"

"None of my members in Vinton, Iowa, was divorced during the ten years of our existence as a congregation."

"During my eleven years in Parkersburg, W. Va., we have had only one divorce case in the congregation."

"As to the marriages covering the entire twenty-three years of my present ministry in Elmhurst, Ill., there were three divorces and one separation. In the three divorce cases one pair was not affiliated with our Church, while the other two were mixed marriages."

"I am happy to report that there has been no divorce case in my congregation in Buffalo during the entire seventeen years of its existence"

"There has been no divorce in the history of my congregation in Stratford, Ont., in twenty-one years."

"From 1919 to 1933 I performed 162 marriages in Chicago, and according to the best information I have, there were two divorces. In only one case, against which marriage I protested, were both husband and wife members of our Church."

"Within the history of this congregation in Athens, Ill., which dates back to 1877, I have knowledge of only one divorce. case the wife was not a member of our Church."

"In all my twenty-one years in Los Angeles I have had no divorces"

"To my knowledge there is not a single case of divorce in the thirty years' existence of my congregation at Chicago Park, Cal."

"Of the 97 couples I have married during the past ten years in Madison, Wis., only one has come before the divorce court."

"During the past ten years I have married some 75 couples here in Elmhurst, N. Y., and to my knowledge not one of these marriages has proved an unhappy one."

"In my church, during its twelve and a half years of existence, 169 marriages were performed, and of these 2 ended in divorce. Both were marriages between Lutherans and non-Lutherans."

"In my twenty-seven years of ministerial work, during which I ministered to approximately 1,400 souls, I cannot recall having had a single divorce case."

"There has been no divorce in my congregation at Howell, Nebr., so far. My congregation was organized in 1893"

"Throughout my ministry of almost twelve years here in Duluth, Minn., we have not had a single case of divorce."

"In the ten years of this congregation's existence in Brentwood, Pa., there have been no divorces at all."

Multiplied statements to the same effect come from thousands of Christian pastors throughout the land and emphasize this basic truth: the tie which binds is the Christian marriage, and the safest guide to marital happiness is the Scriptural code of marriage.

There is no corresponding precision by which the constructive forces of Christianity can be tabulated for other aspects of family life. In the very nature of the case no statistics are available for the relative occurrence of family quarrels within and without the Church. Neither are there any tabulations covering desertions, separations, and annulments, or the mutual attitudes of parents and children as these are influenced by church affiliation. No one except the rabid exponents of atheistic upheaval can be blind to the fact that Christianity is the most successful power in preventing the disorganization of the family. It is one of the tragedies of present-day social science that, while detailed consideration is accorded the multiplied influences of heredity and environment, of health and vocational factors, sociology quite completely discounts the sustaining forces of Christianity and minimizes the pivotal importance of a spiritually regenerated heart and life.

Young people will make no mistake by heeding the clear voice of repeated and harmonious experience. Recently the people of Longview, Texas, gathered with Mr. and Mrs. William F. Kelley to celebrate their eighty-first wedding anniversary. Mr. Kelley, aged 109, and Mrs. Kelley, aged 105, were married four years before the Civil War. The young husband tried to enlist in the Confederate Army, but medical examiners rejected him, asserting that his health was so poor that he could not live long; yet Mr. Kelley survived these dire prophecies by seventy-seven years, — so healthful has his wedded life proved itself. This unique marriage brought both husband and wife much blessing; and believing that eighty-one years of happy matrimony give a father and mother reason to speak with authority, newspaper men asked the Kelleys for formulae summarizing their requisites for a long and happy marriage. The answer of these two Texans, whose marriage experience embraces more than four fifths of a century, was short, direct, unmistakable. "For a long and happy marriage," they declared, "we need have unwavering faith in God, hard work, and moderation in all things."

In a day of easy and quick divorces it is refreshing to read almost identical counsel from others who have been similarly blessed by many joyous years of matrimony. When townspeople of Wyckoff, New Jersey, met to congratulate "Uncle Johnny" Demarest, age ninety-eight, and his wife, "Auntie Susan," age ninety-six, on their seventy-sixth wedding anniversary, the couple gave this recipe for wedded bliss: "Hard work, forgiving faults, home-cooking, and going to church." Again, when Mr. and Mrs. Gennung of Horseheads, New York, celebrated their sixtieth anniversary, they attributed their marital harmony to music (Mr. Gennung is a musician, and his wife accompanies him), hard work, good cooking, and especially regular attendance at divine worship.

Read the current advertisements, and you will believe that a happy marriage depends on the avoidance of dishpan hands, bad breath, perspiration odors, gray laundry, pink toothbrush. Whatever of practical physical prudence and cure may lurk in these prescriptions by these self-appointed domestic doctors, the fact remains that for protracted and increasing happiness in marriage, young people need Christ, first of all.

To offer a concise, workable, every-day help for the attainment of the high ideals of Christian marriage, I give this prescription for wedded happiness:

1.  "Whatever ye do [in courtship and in marriage] in word and deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus!"
2.  Make Christ the Counselor in your wedding plans by invoking His help through prayer!
3.  Focus home ideals on this central, pivotal point: "My partner in life must be of my faith, my Church. We must both worship the same Christ in the same sincerity and devotion!"
4.  Resolve: Every Sunday, with only those exceptions which necessity demands, will find me with my beloved one in church!
5.  Resolve: From the first day of our wedded life, in sunshine and shadow, in health and sickness, in prosperity and poverty, our home will be a Church of Christ where the Savior will be worshiped in the study of His Word and in prayer!
6.  Resolve: Christ will be the ennobling, uplifting, refining, selfishness-destroying power in my life, so that, instead of insisting upon rights, I will live in and by the spirit of the humble, self-giving Savior!
7.  Resolve: All problems and perplexities that may arise in my household will be decided not by the dictates of popular opinion and wide-spread practice but by clear statements of the Word of God!

### THE PLEDGE OF MULTIPLIED BLESSINGS

And God blessed them - Gen. 1:28

When a man and a woman wed, they enter upon a relationship which in its origin and attendant blessings bears the stamp of divine approval. God, having created His living, breathing masterpiece, the first man, laid down this universal truth for all subsequent ages: "It is not good that the man should be alone" (Gen. 2:18); that is, it is not compatible with his highest happiness, his complete usefulness, to remain unmarried. This declaration of divine wisdom was then translated into divine action; God created for man a helpmate who corresponded to him physically, mentally, and spiritually. And when the first bride of all history was presented to the first groom, "the voice that breathed o'er Eden that earliest wedding-day" pronounced its primal blessing. This divine benediction, the majestic "And God blessed them," has become the sacred pledge of happiness in Christian marriage.

Marriage is not merely a civil, economic, or social arrangement and institution; it is, as the first pages of the Bible emphasize, God's great gift to humanity. To speak disdainfully of married life, to invoke sarcasm upon it, is to exalt the puny errors of pigmy minds over the eternal truth of Heaven — to blaspheme God.

This radiant blessing is so deep-rooted that it shines through the barrage with which sin has beclouded the luster of holy matrimony. In all the hideous array of sins the most degenerate and destructive are those exhibitions of human perversity which cling to sex and marriage. Yet, though marred by these ugly gashes, blasphemed by unnatural sins, and betrayed by the inconsistencies that remain even in a Christ-centered life, marriage can still have much of its divine heritage and reflect part of the Edenic blessings.

#### MARRIAGE AND HEALTH

The practical benefits of marriage, evident in many aspects of life, are particularly noteworthy in their promotion of personal well-being. The Health Department of the City of Chicago compiled these statistics to show the comparative health and longevity of men who are unmarried, married, or divorced:

Of every 1,000 divorced men in that city between the ages of 25 and 34, 15 died during a twelve-month period. Of a similar number of single men 5 died, and of 1,000 married men in parallel group only 4 died.

Taking the group between the ages of 35 and 44, of 1,000 in each class, 18 divorced, 14 single, and 7 married men died.

Next comes the age between 45 and 54. Whereas 37 divorced and 23 single men died in each 1,000 of this class, only 14 married men succumbed.

After middle age, between 55 and 64, in their respective groups of 1,000, 56 divorced, 49 bachelors, and only 29 married men died.

Of 1,000 men over 65 years old, 116 divorced, 112 single, but only 80 married men passed away.

Remarkable corroboration for these figures is furnished by vital statistics of England and Germany. In Great Britain, Prof. G. M. Robertson, president of the College of Physicians at Edin-burgh, shows that married men between 25 and 55 on the average live four years longer than their unmarried brothers. Recent German health records grant a statistical five years more of life to the average married man and woman.

It is part of the professional duty of Dr. Eugene Lyman Fiske, medical director of the Life Extension Institute, New York, to establish the ratios of longevity in different occupations, sexes, and classes. His findings, like the following, are therefore of special significance: "The lives of married women are on the average a good deal longer than the lives of spinsters. The lives of married men are on the average longer than those of bachelors. ... The death-rate of bachelors in middle life is twice that of married men. In the case of married women and spinsters we have this: The vast majority of married women are mothers. The spinsters represent a class of non-mothers. The function of maternity seems to involve a general bodily quickening, which is a help to health and longevity."

A 1936 publication of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company concludes "that the relatively staid and regular course of married life is healthier than the comparatively free and easy ways of the unmarried." This investigation shows that "among males over fifteen years of age the standardized death-rate for bachelors is 1,218.2 per 100,000 as compared with 855.9 for married men. Among females the standardized death-rate for spinsters is 1,039.1, as against 856.6 for the married of all ages."

In Suicide Problems, Dr. Friedrich Hoffmann summarizes (p. 17): "It would seem that the single are more liable to suicide than the married, while the rate is apparently highest among the divorced."

The well-ordered life in a normal marriage, together with the obvious physical benefits which accrue from regular and carefully prepared meals, the supervision of personal habits, and the physical benefits of home-life give the husband and wife a well-sustained basis for health which the unmarried often forfeit. When the city of Weinsberg was besieged in December of 1140 and the brave women had finally secured permission from Conrad III to leave the city together with their most precious possession, they marched out in one of the strangest parades history has witnessed: each wife carried her husband to life and liberty. In a less dramatic manner many self-effacing wives have borne their husbands out of the siege of prolonged illness and chronic indisposition. Katherine Luther is reported to have said that she was very happy to cook for her distinguished husband herself, because almost every time he left Wittenberg on one of his numerous trips, he took sick.

#### MARRIAGE AND MORALS

Again, when the Scriptures denounce the wilful abstinence from marriage they have the support of sociological research in the field of morals. The investigation of 200,000 arrests in Detroit covering a seven-year period reveals, according to Solon H. Rose of the Detroit Bureau of Governmental Research, that the "rate of arrest of single men for vagrancy is eleven times that of married men; robbery by violence, six times greater; drunkenness, three and a half times greater; gambling, three times greater; disorderly conduct, three times greater; simple larceny, three times greater; immorality, two and a half times greater." Similarly, Prof. William Fielding Ogburn of Columbia University testifies that married men are less liable to commit crimes than bachelors. Prison statistics and the census of penitentiaries have consistently shown a preponderance of unmarried criminals in both sexes.

We need not search far afield for an explanation; the stabilizing influences of Christian marriage are all too evident. The man whose life is blessed with the love of a trusting wife and dependent children, or the woman who is concerned about meeting her duties as wife and mother, will find that marriage offers both a constant check on wrong and a powerful incentive for right. In addition, the moral vigilance of a solicitous husband or wife, the more permanent ties of a home, the more responsible position that marriage commands in society, — these factors inevitably tend to restrict crime.

The French writer and liberalist De Tocqueville confessed to a friend: "I cannot describe to you the happiness yielded in the long run by the habitual society of a woman in whose soul all that is good in your own is reflected naturally and even improved. When I say or do a thing which seems to me to be perfectly right, I read immediately in Marie's countenance an expression of proud satisfaction which elevates me; and so when my conscience reproaches me, her face instantly clouds over. Although I have great power on her mind, I see with pleasure that she awes me; and so long as I love her as I do now, I am sure that I shall never allow myself to be drawn into anything that is wrong."

History shows that every age of national immorality has been marked by a breakdown of marriage ideals. In Greece, with the collapse of decency in the fourth century, marriage was spurned by many as a cumbersome restriction. In the Augustan age of Rome, despite legal enactments designed to lead people into matrimony, devious methods of escape were invented, and it was only with utmost disdain that the upper social castes in the corrupted empire regarded family life. Is it not profoundly significant that the greatest crime wave in American history is inundating our country at a time when marital ideals have dropped to their lowest level? There must be a deep and direct connection between marriage and morality; for as soon as marriage and home-life crumble and col-lapse, crime rides high.

#### MARRIAGE AND MENTALITY

Count Keyserling, hailed by many as one of the world's greatest thinkers, repeating Cicero's famous maxim that a man cannot devote himself both to a wife and to philosophy, charged that marriage is a check on mental progress. He declared: "The man who aspires to greatness must never marry; for marriage overwhelmingly defeats all individuality in a man, makes his thoughts subservient to those of his wife, and precludes all possibility of the exercise of genius." "During eight hundred years of the world's history," he told an American audience, "no man of spirit ever married. a monastery instead. Marriage makes man a slave..." When accosted by the paradox of his own life (Count Keyserling married the granddaughter of Germany's Iron Chancellor, Bismarck), he explained: "True, I am married, but I married late in life. I had an opportunity to think, to give vent to my ideas, unhampered by a woman's meager intelligence. Has there ever been a great woman thinker — a really great one? No."

In a similar vein Blanche Colton Williams, Ph.D., of the English Department, Hunter College, New York City, is quoted as asserting: "I am a spinster, and I'm glad of it. All my life I've been dodging love and working my head off. ... I know several famous writers who have deliberately sidestepped motherhood because they wanted to keep their creative energy for mental work."

These claims, attributing a superior ability to the unmarried, are contradicted by decisive facts. Prof. G. M. Robertson has compiled evidence to show that between the ages of 25 and 55 disordered minds are almost three times as common among single people as among the married. He summarizes: "One may conclude from this low incidence of insanity that the condition of marriage is the most favorable mode of existence for both men and women." A 1936 report by Dr. James Paige of Columbia University and Dr. Carney Landis of the New York Psychiatric Institute, based on the records of mental hospitals in New York State and Massachusetts, concludes that the insanity rate among divorced people is four times as high as among the married, among the widowed three times as high, and among the unmarried twice as high as among the married.

In imposing array, men of eminence have acknowledged the mental stimulation of marriage. Thomas Hood, the English poet, wrote these words of tribute to his wife: "I never was anything, Dearest, till I knew you, and I have been a better, happier, and more prosperous man ever since. Lay by that truth ir. lavender, Sweetest, and remind me of it when I fail. I am writing warmly and fondly, but not without good cause. ... Perhaps there is an afterthought that, whatever may befall me, the wife of my bosom will have the acknowledgment of her tenderness, worth, excellence, — all that is wifely or womanly, — from my pen." Huber, the Swiss naturalist, blinded from his early youth, conducted his observations on the study of bees through the eyes of his wife. Dr. Edwin Brant Frost, director of Yerkes Observatory for twenty-seven years when he retired in 1932, was known as the "blind astronomer." For fifteen years after he lost his eyesight he continued to sweep the heavens and survey celestial bodies with an exactness that attracted wide attention. His wife assisted him in these studies, and it was largely through her eyes that he could continue to observe the stars and the planets. In many more instances than the world knows, a devoted, far-sighted wife has brought out latent talents, released and promoted the progress of her husband.

In short, take any list of humans greatness, the Hall of Fame in New York City, Who's Who in America, a list of the preeminent American statesmen, patriots, inventors, authors, scientists, and others who have contributed to the physical, moral, or intellectual progress of the nation, and the overwhelming preponderance of those who are married will utterly refute any theory of special genius development outside wedded life.

#### MARRIAGE AND SPIRITUALITY

If it were possible to make a roster of the converts brought into the Church through the prayers and the example of a Christian husband or wife, the total would be amazing. This guidance is one of the most helpful missionary agencies. Frequently of course a Christian husband does not influence his unbelieving wife in this way, and St. Paul warns explicitly against any overconfidence in postmarital conversions: "For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?" (1 Cor. 7:16.) But St. Peter recognizes the importance of Christian conduct in marital relations and explicitly instructs believing wives throughout the Church to walk in humility and obedience, so that unbelieving husbands may "be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear." (1 Pet. 3:1, 2.)

Typical of those who have been shown the mercies of Heaven through the devotion of a Christian wife is John Bunyan. To his life-mate he pays this tribute: "My mercy was to light upon a wife whose father and mother were accounted godly. This woman and I, though we came together as poor as poor might be (not having so much household stuff as a dish or a spoon betwixt us both), yet she had for her part The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven and The Practice of Piety, which her father had left her when he died."

Spurgeon wrote to his wife: "I have served the Lord for more and never less for your sweet companionship! ... You are as an angel of God to me.... Bravest of women, strong in the faith, you have ministered unto me. ... God bless thee out of the seventh heaven!"

Once when George Whitefield was preaching in the open air, he was attacked by a gang of ruffians, who approached him with threats and began to pick up stones. "Then," so Whitefield himself describes the scene, "my wife, who was standing beside me, pulled my coat and said, 'George, play the man for your God!' My confidence returned. I again spoke to the multitude with boldness and affection. They became still, and many were affected."

Alexander Maclaren, illustrious British preacher, who died in 1910 at the age of eighty-four, enshrined his wife in this glorious memorial: "In 1856 Marion Maclaren became my wife. God allowed us to be together till 1884. Others could speak of her charm, her beauty, her gifts, and her goodness. Most of what she was to me is forever locked in my heart. But I would fain that it should be told that the best part of what I have been able to do all came and comes from her."

Every assault on marriage is a direct arraignment of the Christian religion, just as any assault on Christianity stretches the line of attack to the home sector. The immediate consequence of the atheistic revolt in Russia against God and His Anointed was the attempt to demolish Christian home-life. Not one of the anti-marriage agitators is distinguished for Christian faith.

On the other hand, it can be shown that the conservative principles of marriage make for deeper spirituality. It is not the childless family that forms the backbone of the Church, nor are men and women who have been divorced for reasons not recognized by the Scriptures distinguished for their sense of religious responsibility.

#### MARRIAGE AND SUCCESS

Marriage has also served as a stimulus to progress and advancement in business. The second edition of America's Young Men, published in 1936, may be cited as authority for this state-ment. From a list of more than 20,000 young men under forty-five years, 6,010 distinguished biographies were selected for inclusion in that volume. The publishers' statement declares: "Those whose biographies appear were chosen because their records were ones of achievement and deserving of national recognition. Our established policy, rigidly adhered to, makes it impossible for any one to purchase a listing."

This new biographical record of outstanding young men in America embraces such public figures as Robert M. Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago; Milton E. Lord, librarian, Boston Public Library; Robert La Follette, Jr., U.S. Senator from Wisconsin; Philip La Follette, ex-governor of Wisconsin; Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Secretary of the Treasury; Henry R. Luce, president and editor of Time and Fortune.

A statistical investigation of the names found in this Who's Who of the younger generation shows that 87 per cent (or 5,229) of the men listed are married, — a remarkable preponderance, in view of the large number of younger men among the 781 unmarried who, we may reasonably expect, will sooner or later establish their own homes.

Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain does not hesitate to acknowledge the indebtedness which he owed to his wife for his successful diplomatic career. Back in 1933, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he said of Mrs. Chamberlain, at whose urgent request he had left his business in Birmingham to enter the diplomatic service of his country: "She has shared all my plans; she has been privy to all my secrets; she has never divulged one, she never will. She has rejoiced in my success. She has encouraged me in my disappointments. She has warned me of dangerous courses, and she has never allowed me to forget that humanity underlies all of politics."

The help on the pathway of achievement which comes through the love of a far-sighted wife is acknowledged by the tribute which the late President Ripley of the Santa Fe Railroad paid to Mrs. Ripley at a testimonial dinner on his seventieth birthday. "It was a notable gathering of men," an eye-witness tells us; "I think every large railroad in the United States was represented, and it was evident that the praise bestowed upon Mr. Ripley, although well deserved, was causing him much embarrassment, as he was essentially a modest man. I was sitting next to his son, Robert M. Ripley, and he was about as much embarrassed as his father. 'Father will break down under this; he cannot stand much praise,' he remarked to me several times during the dinner.

"When it came time for Mr. Ripley to respond, — and he was not given to public speaking, — much concern was felt for him; but instead of breaking down, referring to his own work or to the compliments which had been paid to him, he began his remarks as follows:

" 'Before proceeding, I desire here to pay tribute to her who forty-four years ago joined her fortunes to mine and who ever since has provided the comforts and rest of a quiet home; who twice has accompanied me through the valley of the shadow of death; who has watched over me mentally, morally, and physically; and who is mainly responsible for such success as I have had in conserving mind and body. I ask you, friends, to join in drinking the health of my wife?'

"The effect on his hearers was electric. You could have heard a pin drop in the room. Up to that time nobody had noticed Mrs. Ripley, who was sitting alone in a box, evidently more concerned with her husband's health than anything else. All eyes of course were turned upon her, and at the close of his tribute the audience rose and drank to her health and happiness."

#### MARRIAGE AND HAPPINESS

By the general consent of men of all races, colors, and climes, marriage is normally regarded as an effective pledge for human happiness. Many have affected a superior sophistication, it is true, and have confidently boasted that their independence would never be marred by family duties. The Greeks told of Stratocles, that bitter misogynist, who hated all women with such a perfect hatred that, "if thou hadst heard him, thou wouldst have loathed thine own mother and sister." Yet along came Myrilla, the daughter of Anticles, the gardener, and Stratocles shaved off his patriarchal beard and donned a laurel crown to camouflage a hairless head.

"Pagan history!" some one objects. Yet Livingstone, at the outset of his Odyssey into equatorial Africa, was firm in his resolution to remain a celibate. He insisted: "Although I was at first inclined to be foolish, there is nobody worth taking off one's hat to. Daughters of missionaries have miserably contracted minds. Colonial ladies are worse and worse." However, he changed his verdict on missionaries' girls when he met Mary, daughter of Dr. Moffat, the great South African missionary. She was only "a matter-of-fact lady, a little thick, black-haired girl, yet," he added,"one that I want."

"But," it is argued, "modern marriage does not bring happiness." And there are many unhappy unions; for wherever the ennobling power of the Savior's faith is neglected, the selfishness of sin can provoke friction and invite discord. Yet entirely apart from the religious issues involved, it can be demonstrated that there is normally much human happiness in marriage. Dr. Katherine B. Davis (Factors in the Sex Life of 2,200 Women) tells us that among 1,000 married women questioned, 876 classified themselves as happy. Studies among the 1,200 unmarried women showed that a considerable portion felt the desire for marriage and its happiness.

History is replete with notable examples of the happiness that marriage has brought. The statesman Burke declared: "Every care vanishes the moment I enter under my own roof," while Washington Irving, a bachelor, admitted that he regarded himself as less fitted to bear the ills of life's misfortunes.

J. Ramsay MacDonald, former British Premier, penned this glowing tribute to his wife: "To turn to her in stress and storm was like going into a sheltered haven where waters were at rest. ... Weary and worn, buffeted and discouraged, thinking of giving up the thankless strife,... I would flee with her to my Buckingham-shire home, and my lady would heal and soothe me with her cheery faith and steady conviction and send me forth to smite and be smitten. No one, not even I, can tell with accuracy how much of the steadiness there is in the labor movement in this country is due to her."

While the outcome of an election was pending, Theodore Roosevelt wrote to his sister these lines (quoted in Dahlberg: Youth and the Homes of Tomorrow), which portray the source of happiness he found in his home and family: "As I went up the White House steps, Edith came to meet me at the door, and I suddenly realized that, after all, no matter what the outcome of the election was, that, even though my ambition to have the seal of approval put upon my administration might not be gratified, my happiness was assured; for my life with Edith and my children constitutes my happiness."

When David Lloyd George and his wife returned to Wales after celebrating their golden wedding in the south of France, Welsh friends gathered to honor their distinguished countryman. At this time the noted statesman said, first humorously, but then in all seriousness:

"Marriage is the greatest and oldest partnership in the world. It is the best and truest friendship in the world; it carries one through the troubles, bothers, and worries of the world, and it is one of the very few institutions which enable people whose dispositions or temperaments are exactly the opposite to live in perfect harmony for fifty years.

"I need hardly say that my wife and I are of different temperaments. One of us is contentious, combative, and stormy. [Laughter.] That is my wife. Then there is the other partner, placid, calm, peaceful, and patient. That is I. [Laughter.]

"But in spite of the fundamental differences in our dispositions we have lived in perfect harmony for fifty years."

The Evangelical Christian of Toronto, Canada, explaining that the fundamental basis of this union is Christian faith, states: "During the hectic days of the war, when the responsibility rested on this man, he was never unduly perturbed by the course of events but found strength and comfort in divine things and in the singing of old Gospel hymns. His home-life was happy, and in the Christian fellowship and help of his wife he could bear such burdens as few men are ever called upon to carry."

"Her price is far above rubies," is the Scriptural estimate of a virtuous wife (Prov. 31:10), and as an understandable pride comes with the possession of precious rubies, so the joy of marriage, "honorable in all," reaches to incomparable heights.

#### IS THERE A HIGHER HAPPINESS?

With all these multiplied blessings it comes as a distinct shock to realize that the Roman Catholic Church and certain groups within the Church of England, still insist that the deeper spiritual life and the higher happiness is found in the unmarried state. The Roman Church, by misinterpretation of Eph. 5:32, has given matrimony the dignity of a sacrament; but in misinterpretation of other passages it permits the Council of Trent to anathematize all who insist "that it is not better and more blessed to remain in virginity or in celibacy than to be united in matrimony" (Sess. 14, c. 10).

In support of these claims, reference is constantly made to certain statements of St. Paul, notably this advice given "by permission and not of commandment": "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I." (1 Cor. 7:8.) To find in these words a general endorsement of the unmarried state as a superior holiness is entirely unfounded; for the apostle's general, normal rule has already been stated: "Let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own hus-band." (1 Cor. 7:2.) Now, "by permission," he added a personal, qualifying remark, in which, because of the extraordinary dangers of his day, he expressed the wish that those who had not entered wedlock remain unmarried, so that they could engage wholly in the work of the Church. But the apostle realized that this complete dedication was possible only in exceptional individuals, and he hastened to add for the benefit of those who do not share this continence, "Let them marry." (L.c., 9.) To distort the personal opinion of the apostle, permitted by the Spirit (words which he regards as applicable only to the restricted class of humanity capable of the same forbearance), into a sweeping endorsement of the unmarried state is to do violence to the plain meaning of the text. Today, too, we may repeat the apostle's suggestion as our opinion and say that it is good for those who have this degree of continence to sacrifice the pleasures of home-life in complete dedication to the higher interests of the Church. But we must also ask, How many can qualify under these requirements? It takes the all-consuming heroism of a spiritual Titan like St. Paul. Remember the pronouncement of our Lord in Matt. 19:11.

On the contrary, celibacy is condemned by that sweeping, all-comprehensive verdict which the divine Creator immortalized in the opening records of human history: "It is not good that the man should be alone." (Gen. 2:18.) No limitations, no qualifications, no restrictions, in this all-embracing statement of divine wisdom! Even more specifically, as though the Holy Spirit had anticipated the belittling of marriage, does St. Paul declare (1 Tim. 3:2) "A bishop... must be blameless, the husband of one wife." And to brand contrary teachings with divine disapproval, St. Paul tells us "that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, ... having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from Roman and High Church doctrines.

In harmony with these plain Scriptural statements we find that Peter, hailed as the first Pope, was married (Matt. 8:14). Early bishops were likewise married; early church councils refused to demand or even endorse celibacy; and before the admixture of paganized survivals, in which nuns were to take the place of vestal virgins and monks the position of the celibate priests of Apollo, Christianity, with the exception of some heretical teachers, upheld with one voice the sanctity and the blessing of marriage.

On moral grounds likewise celibacy deserves condemnation. This glorification of the unmarried life has been responsible for more misery, bodily and spiritual suffering, and clerical obscenity than can be estimated. It submerged the clergy under a flood of unspeakable sins, so that a careful historian, whose technical accuracy is commended even by the Encyclopedia Britannica, writes: "The records of the Middle Ages are accordingly full of the evidences that indiscriminate license of the worst kind prevailed throughout every rank of the hierarchy." (Henry Chase Lea, History of Sacerdotal Celibacy, V: 1, 423.)

The clerical rejection of marriage spread its destructive in-fuences among the laity. The judgment of careful historical investigation is this: "In thus reviewing the influences which a nominally celibate clergy exercised over those entrusted to their care, it is perhaps scarcely too much to conclude that they were largely responsible for the laxity of morals which is a characteristic of medieval society. No one who has attentively examined the records left to us of that society can call in question the extreme prevalence of the licentiousness which everywhere infected it." (Lea, I.c., p. 440.)

In addition to weakening the morals of both the clergy and the laity, this vilification of marriage explains much of the retardation of the Dark Ages. The repression of natural impulses and the glorification of asceticism, the repudiation of the blessings of family life, and the corresponding tolerance of brazen vileness, - all these combined to establish a code of conduct which of necessity blasted away the benefits of progress and intellectual development. Celibacy helped to mold a philosophy expressed in the life of a monk in the Carthusian order in Normandy who cultivated lice and maggots in the filth of his hairy garments and who, in priding himself on his unmarried holiness, often permitted the vermin to crawl over his face.

No wonder that all clear-thinking men agree with sentiments like those expressed by Theodore Roosevelt in his American Ideals (p. 320): "All religions and all forms of religion in which the principle of asceticism receives any marked development are positively antagonistic to the development of the social organism." No wonder that from time to time enlightened minds within the Catholic Church have risen up to petition the abolition of compulsory celibacy. For long periods the Uniat churches of the Greek rite enjoyed the privilege of having a married clergy. The Uniat congregations recognize the papacy and subscribe to all Roman Catholic doctrines and are an integral part of that Church; but by the Treaty of Unghvar, 1646, its clergy was accorded the right to marry before ordination.

A modern contrast instructively emphasizes the blessings of a married clergy. From facts secured by the publishers of Who's Who in America it appears that of all the distinguished Americans listed in this roster of contemporaneous distinction one out of every nine is the son of a clergyman. This does not include those cases — and they were not inconsiderable in number — in which the father was described as "farmer and preacher" or "teacher and preacher." Applying this ratio to the general population and to specific groups, it is seen that "clergymen fathered fully twenty-eight times the average number of notables," as Who's Who computes notability. Clergymen of the last generation contributed proportionately 2,400 times as many eminent sons as did unskilled la-borers, thirty-five times as many as farmers, four times as many as business men, and over twice as many as the average of other professional men.

Dr. Clarence G. Campbell, president of the Eugenics Research Association, in his address at the 1930 annual meeting in New York City, declared: "We know from reliable, factual data that the best quality of leaders rises, and rises in the greatest frequency, from the progeny of the clergy." The Boston Herald, upholding this claim, brings the following compilation: "Three of the Presidents of the United States came from the homes of clergymen, and seven daughters of clergymen have held the proud position of mistress of the White House. Of Senators and Representatives the parsonage has fathered a multitude. John Hancock and eight other 'signers' were born of clergymen fathers. More sons of ministers than any other class have become the heads of colleges and schools in America. The Wright brothers of airplane fame were sons of a United Brethren bishop. Charles Evans Hughes, Cyrus W. Field, Henry James, the novelist, and William James, the psychologist, Lyman Abbott, Edward Everett Hale, Stephen J. Field, and David J. Brewer of the Supreme Court Bench, all were sons of clergymen.

"Inscribed in the Hall of Fame in New York are now sixty-five names, and of these ten are the names of sons of the clergy, and one was a daughter of the manse. Ralph Waldo Emerson came from a long line of clergymen; Jonathan Edwards was the founder of one of the most remarkable families in the history of the United States; Henry Clay was the son of a Baptist clergy-man; James Russell Lowell was the son of the Rev. Charles Lowell; the father of Samuel F. B. Morse was a minister in Charlestown; the father of George Bancroft was the son of the Rev. Aaron Bancroft; Henry Ward Beecher was the son, and Harriet Beecher Stowe the daughter, of 'old Lyman Beecher'; Francis Parkman's father was a Boston clergyman; Oliver Wendell Holmes was the son of the Rev. Abiel Holmes; and Louis Agassiz was the son of a Protestant pastor of a parish in Switzerland. Eleven in sixty-five is 17 per cent. Can scions of any other occupation surpass it?" The English roster of distinguished children of the parsonage includes in the British literary circles Ben Jonson, Oliver Goldsmith, Joseph Addison, William Cowper, Samuel Coleridge, Henry Hal-lam, James A. Froude, William Hazlitt, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, and the three Bronte sisters. Other notable Englishmen who are the offspring of clergymen are Sir Christopher Wren, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Cecil Rhodes, Dr. Edward Jenner, Sir Wilfred Grenfell.

When Rudyard Kipling died on January 17, 1936, press biographers took front-page space to tell us that both of his grandfathers were ministers and to furnish this account of the close association of this clerical family with the cultural life of England: "His mother was one of four daughters of the Rev. George B. Macdonald, all destined to marriages which brought them roles in the cultural history of England. Georgiana married Sir Edward Burne-Jones when that noted painter's possessions totaled about $150; Agnes became the wife of Edward Poynter, just as impecunious then as Burne-Jones, but who later achieved the presidency of the Royal Academy and became a baronet; Louise, herself an etcher, married Alfred Baldwin, ironmaster, and her son, Stanley Baldwin, became the second man in British history to hold the prime ministership four times. The fourth sister, Alice, fell in love with John Lockwood Kipling, a designer of terra-cotta and a student in the art schools at Kensington."

No lengthy comment is thus required to emphasize the sound home influences radiated from Christian parsonages. The contributions to human advancement made by the children of clergymen are telling blows against celibacy.

#### MARRIAGE BLESSINGS - BY CONTRAST

Suppose for a moment that the ideals of celibacy were carried through to their logical extremes, that a program of matrimonial anarchism could be enforced and that in revolt against Bible standards Christian marriage were utterly obliterated. The resultant picture would be hideous beyond imagination. The ties of patriotism that have always bound men and women to their native land would be broken; for the adoption of theories tending toward laxity in private life are frequently accompanied by agitations for inter-nationalism, pacifism, and parallel flare-ups. (Witness Bertrand Russell's repeated invectives against pure patriotism.) In the temple of national ideals marital purity is fundamental. Tear it down, and the whole structure, with all its healthy emotions, topples into ruins; for when selfish materialism becomes the dominating factor in any philosophy of life, it immediately bans all benevolent or patriotic aspirations.

The further recoil from the paganized pursuit of lust, which would eliminate marriage, is the stifling of the emotions of true love. If God has rested His blessings on the ordinance of holy matrimony, His vindictive judgment has placed its stabbing curse on those who in word and deed assail its holiness. The scavenger who paws about in the sewage loses his capacity for the appreciation of the clean and the beautiful. Ears that have been perpetually tuned to foul-mouthed blasphemies and profanity will fail to respond to the melodies of dulcet harmony. The sensualist, whose norm is not the Law of God, but the pandering to animal impulses, may speak glibly of his new freedom and the happiness which gratification affords; in truth his jaded outlook on life is so saturated by lust that he is utterly incapable of experiencing the thrill of purity, truth, and beauty.

As we survey this nightmare of lust conjured up by the picture of a world arrayed against the Scriptural family ethics, we turn with grateful relief to the divine benediction embodied in Christian marriage. "And He blessed them!" Let this truth guide the Church's youth as it looks at marriage in a confused day.

## PATHWAYS TO PURITY

### THE CHRIST WHO CLEANSES

If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature - 2 Cor. 5:17

In the multiplied questions of courtship and married life one of the strongest assets is the purity demanded by the Christian marriage code. Unshackled apostles of "the new marital morality" (as though true morals could ever change!) may rise up to contradict and preach devotion to instincts rather than to ideals. But they have helped produce the cynical, world-worn young person for whom life offers no mysteries and few genuine thrills - parodies of the finer existence. They may champion the pursuit of the forbidden; but what of the bitter after-taste, the repulsive memories, the nightmare of regret, and the dawn of delusion? There may be a beckoning invitation in this alluring appeal of the ages, "Your eyes shall be opened," but youth that has focused its gaze on the flares of forbidden fire will find that its vision has become blurred.

#### THE APPEAL FOR PURITY

In concise terms does Christ's faith demand stainlessness in thought and life. "Keep thyself pure" (1 Tim. 5:22) is the plea of the fatherly apostle to his young assistant Timothy; and the Savior Himself, summing up the contents of a hundred Scriptural statements, lays this high premium on chastity: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (Matt. 5:8) .

The temptations to impurity are the most insistent and alluring of all enticements. Young people who repudiate the very suggestion of stealing, who shrink from the mere thought of injuring their fellow-men, to whom slander and profanity are repul-sive; leaders who zealously guard a loyal interest in their homes and in their Church, often find that the lure of lust has a tremendous persistence. The powers of morbid memory sharpen the imprint of attractive sins. The fare-back of an inflamed imagination conjures up sensual pictures. The baser impulses beat their enchanting tattoo against all too human hearts. And the cry goes out from every Christian soul: "How can I keep pure?"

#### "THY SINS ARE FORGIVEN"

Jesus answers this appeal, first of all, by removing the sins of impurity. In the midst of His busy ministry our Savior once dined with a Pharisee, unidentified except by the not uncommon name Simon. The welcome which our Lord received at the hands of His host was not marked by any noteworthy warmth; for the usual conventions of hospitality, the washing of the feet, the anointing of the head, and the kiss of salutation, were omitted. During the progress of the dinner, while the Pharisees conversed with Christ, an unwelcome intrusion suddenly interrupted the table-talk. An abandoned woman, notorious even for the none too squeamish in erupted morals of her community, has gained access to the dining-room and fallen to the Savior's feet. Almost desperate in her shame, but repentant, she entreats Him for forgiveness — a scarlet woman before the stainless Christ. Pharisaical pride and prejudices object. "If He were a prophet," self-righteous Simon remonstrates within himself, "He would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth Him." Yet Christ, who reads the innermost thoughts, does not shrink back when the penitent begins to perform the neglected rites of footwashing and anointing; and after a protest to Simon in the form of a pointed parable He turns to the prostrate woman and speaks peace to her harassed soul. He does not overlook her moral lapses nor minimize the depth of her fall. Unfailing Friend of sinners that He is, He rejoices at her repen-tance, and with a divine pardon He declares: "Thy sins are for-given... Thy faith hath saved thee."

The name of the penitent has not been immortalized in the records of the gospel. Perhaps delicate restraint has kept her identity secret. Yet an early tradition of the Church, one of several, designates her as Mary of Magdala, and, whether warranted or not, this identification has found popular perpetuation in the name Magdalene. No doubt remains, however, concerning the glorious comfort of this record. Jesus' benediction "Thy sins are forgiven" still breathes pardon and peace into souls distracted by sin.

The keystone of the Christians' creed, without which its arching beauties collapse into shapeless ruins, is the unhesitant acknowledgment of the Savior's suffering and death, by which our multiplied sins are forgiven and removed. Let us guard against the delusion that sin can be removed by a few spoken words. To give His promise of pardon everlasting validity, our Savior died the atoning death on the cross. Thus, our pardon comes from a righteous and merciful God: righteous, because His divine holiness would not. permit sin to remain unpunished; merciful, because of the un-fathomable love of Christ, who took upon Himself all the sins of all lands and all ages of all history, so that "He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities."

Let no young man or woman recall any fracture of the moral code in their own lives, however serious and repulsive it may be, without the positive, Heaven-blessed assurance: "Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound" (Rom. 5:20). No ugly sin in your private life is too loathsome to be forgiven by the all-comprehensive mercy of Christ. He who in the days of His flesh offered His grace to those of impure hearts and stained lives calls out to His wavering, sinful children as they approach Him with contrite, trusting hearts: "Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out" (John 6:37).

This forgiveness, offered to all sinners and for all sins, is not acquired, earned, or merited by the best that we can do or say, by an interminable series of good resolutions, by a lifetime of regrets. In the most exalted love which the omnipotence of Heaven could bestow this release from sin is granted us fully, freely, and for all times without any merit or worthiness on our part, without any cooperation from human agencies, — solely by the eternal mercies of God, through faith in the priceless blood of our Savior. More positive in its power than thousands of the accepted verities of science is this fundamental truth of pure and divine revelation that "the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all sin" (1 John 1:7)

Hold fast to this sacred promise! When the pangs of remorse shake our souls; when the accusing voice of our conscience indicts us on distressing charges; when the inexorable Law, demanding a clean, holy life, confronts us and by contrast we survey our own favorite follies and vices, let us cling to the cross more closely and, beholding our wounded, bleeding, dying Savior, find in Him the fulfillment of the prophet's ancient pledge: "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool" (Is. 1:18).

#### "NEW CREATURES"

There is an added glory. The depth of the Savior's love is not exhausted by the removal of sin. This is the essential prelude to a consecrated life; for there can be no successful program of purity before impurity is removed. Yet in addition to this forgiving mercy Christ also bestows a dynamic power for the attainment of a clean, moral life, the basic foundation for marital joy. It is an axiom of God's Word that, "if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new" (2 Cor. 5:17). As soon as we accept the redemp tion of Christ and trust our lives to His leadership, we have the sanctifying guidance which comes from the indwelling of His Spirit. Ours becomes a directed destiny, which continually presses forward "toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 3:14).

Now, this is not theological theory; it is rather a truth that may be shown by personal analysis and statistical evidence. Why is it that the purest souls on God's earth are twice-born, Spirit-filled men and women? Why has the Church of Jesus Christ been the foremost of the forces contending for the virtues of purity, honor in marriage, happiness in home-life? Why is it that the exemplary modesty of Christian women has elicited expressions of recognition even from pagan scoffers; that Christian homes have become the solid foundation of our best national life, with babies welcomed as the heritage of the heavenly Father, children brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and parents loved, honored, and obeyed? How else can we explain all this unless the Scriptural truth is conceded that the abiding presence of God's Spirit in the heart or home of any Christian is the only influence that can permanently mold lives for a lasting appreciation of the truest, purest, and best?

Church history is written with close lines to accommodate records in which youth, swayed by the lustful philosophies of heathen life, became paragons of purity through the miraculous rebirth in Christian faith. And these miracles are not restricted to the records of a hoary past. Christ's pledge "Behold, I make all things new" (Rev. 21:5) was never more potent than it is today; for Jesus, not by any trial-and-error method nor by vague suggestion but by the hallowed pledge of His own holiness, offers the victorious life to all who believe in His Saviorhood and leadership.

If these pages meet the eyes of young men and women who have never accepted the free mercy of Christ for their souls, may they pause at this place and, directing their gaze to this Savior's cross, pray the prayer: "If Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean." Then, by Jesus' own promise, they can rise with the assurance which once blessed a tormented leper (Matt. 8:3) that Christ is not only able to forgive iniquity, but that He also has the power to create and stimulate purity and chastity.

#### "WITHOUT ME YE CAN DO NOTHING"

Now, it is an axiom of our faith that without Christ there can be no permanent, achieving impulse to purity. "Without Me," He warns, "ye can do nothing"; for "I am the Vine, ye are the branches" (John 15:5). We have tried to legislate purity; indeed the code of laws framed to promote individual and organized decency was never so large as it is today. But multiplied laws mean multiplied transgressions. When the circuit, superior, and appellate courts of Chicago tabulated their calendar for 1938, it was found that 24,771 cases were filed during these twelve months. Of these, about 5,300 (more than one fifth) were docketed for divorce hearings, while in 1934 divorce litigation assumed a smaller proportion, slightly more than one sixth of the total. Because legal decrees cannot permanently elevate the soul but at best can exert only a negative, restraining force, the young man who sets out to capture the stronghold of sin guided only by a battle plan of "Thou shalt nots" will face surrender sooner than he knows.

Nor can education and culture be substitutes for Christ's soul-sanctifying teachings. It is true that even a shrewd, worldly-wise attitude recognizes the advantages of living up to a high moral code. Pagan philosophers have preached that cleanness and honesty bring unmistakable rewards. But how many have followed their own teachings? Our high schools and colleges have stressed ethics; but in contradiction we are forced to admit that there has been little advance in applied ethics. While we develop minds and train intellects, our modern processes of Christless enlightenment have not bridged the gap between the brain and the heart or at best have left our higher impulses untouched.

Only the Christian religion, no creed of any other kind, is a guarantee for moral strength. Can Buddhism show a single transformed soul and an advance toward chastity? Did the temples and convents that crowded Asshur's capital raise the morality, of that metropolis? Has the modern apostasy from fundamental Christianity, with its belittling of sin and magnifying of self, made men and women cleaner and truer? Travelers in the Orient refer in veiled terms to the filth and the nasty perversions depicted on the walls of pagan shrines. Translators of the so-called sacred writings of ancient religions are forced to omit entire sections of these "holy" books because of their glorified vileness. Modernism confesses its own failure. Harry Emerson Fosdick admits: "You see, we Modernists... pare down and dim our faith by negative abstractions until we have left only the remainder of what was once a great religion. Then, seeing how few our positive convictions are and how little they matter, we grow easy-going about every one else's convictions and end in a mush of general con-cessions." Thomas Huxley, British Liberalist, concedes: "The doctrines of predestination, of original sin, of the innate depravity of man, and the evil fate of the greater part of the race, . faulty as they are, appear to me to be vastly nearer the truth than the 'liberal' popular illusions that babies are all born good; ... that it is given to everybody to reach the ethical ideal if he will only try; that all partial evil is universal good, and other optimistic figments." Paul Elmer More, humanist, professor of philosophy at Princeton University and once a Liberal leader, confessed that the social sermon "leaves me often wondering whether I am listening to a sermon or a political harangue. The call of religion is, first of all and last of all, to a soul conscious of its own guilt. The function of religion is, first and last of all, to offer to a despairing soul the promise of eternal life. When under the shadow of an atrocious death Christ said to His disciples: "These things I have spoken unto you that in Me ye might have peace,' ... He was not announcing a gospel of social regeneration or postponing the hope of peace until the iniquities of capitalism should be overcome."

Because Modernism rejects the conviction that in the Scriptures we have divine authority, it surrenders the basis for true morality. Candidly does Walter Lippmann admit (A Preface to Morals, p. 50): "The sanction of a divine morality is the certainty of the believer that it originated with God. But if he has once come to think that the rule of conduct has a purely human, local, and temporal origin, its sanction is gone. His obedience is transformed, as ours has been by knowledge of that sort, from conviction to conformity or calculated expediency."

#### "WE WOULD SEE JESUS"

While there may be a hundred smaller, incidental forces in a young person's resolution to uphold honor and to defeat the encroachments of uncleanness, there is, the Church repeats, only one fountainhead from which the crystal-clear waters of purification flow, and that is Christ. The foundation upon which every pure and Christian life must be built is the heart-deep faith in Christ, the confession clothed in the immortal words of the great Reformer:

"I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord, who has redeemed me, a lost and condemned creature, purchased and won me from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil, not with gold or silver, but with His holy, precious blood and with His innocent suffering and death, that I may be His own and live under Him in His kingdom and serve Him in everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessedness, even as He is risen from the dead, lives and reigns to all eternity. This is most certainly true."

It follows as the day the dawn that every life which prizes purity for its profound blessings should be Christ-centered; that our faith must continually be deepened. As the followers of the Savior in Antioch were called Christians because they bore the imprint of the Crucified in their lives, so we, too, must live in evident companionship with the Savior. Worship at church should be esteemed an opportunity for strengthening the mystic union between Christ and our souls. Our homes should radiate the purifying Christ even externally by banning the voluptuous, nude pictures and statuary and the graceless, Christless literature which sometimes abounds in church-members' homes. Our individual lives must be marked by a restless ambition to learn more about Christ, to appropriate the blessings of His power, to see Him more clearly day by day.

When men cry, as did certain Greeks in the days of our Lord's earthly pilgrimage, "We would see Jesus," through the constant vision of His love and His holiness, our heavenly Father offers us eminently practical helps for the preserving of constant companionship with the Lord Jesus Christ. We have the purifying Word, the inspired with the Lord Jesus Christ. We have the purifying Word, the inspired utterances of a holy God, which will guide us to a purer Life. We have the purifying Sacrament, the mysterious, but divine bestowal of the very body and blood of our Savior, offered to seal the forgiveness of our sins and to energize our ideals of moral honesty and chastity. We have prayer and with it the vast resources of Heaven's omnipotence, placed in the means of grace, which will help us overcome our baser passions, defeat temptations, and rise to the higher, purer levels of the consecrated life.

### SANCTIFIED BY THE WORD

Now are ye clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you. - John 15:3

Some years ago a British editor wrote to the hundred reputedly greatest men in England, submitting this question: "If for any reason you were to spend a year absolutely alone, in a prison, for instance, and you could select from your library three volumes to be with you as your companion in your period of retirement, please inform us what those three books would be." In the answers that came from peers, jurists, statesmen, authors, manufacturers, men representing the successful life, ninety-eight of the hundred chose the Bible as one of these preferred volumes.

More recently the parallel question was asked throughout our country: "What ten books would you take with you if you were exiled on a desert island?" In a group of university professors, for example, some preferred Huckleberry Finn, The Psychology of Insanity, The White House Cook Book, and even The Arabian Nights to the Scriptures. On the other hand, when the readers of the Walther League Messenger, Lutheran young people's paper, were asked to designate the volumes they would include in this library for the marooned, although a total of 171 different books were suggested, every single list included the Bible.

These young people showed a superior thought. For there is within the covers of our Bible a divine uplifting force. When the psalmist (Ps. 119:9) proposes this age-old, yet ever-recurrent, ques-tion: "Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?" he answers by exalting the Bible. With one sweeping statement he sidetracks a long list of human remedies. He places no great store in scientific methods, he knows nothing of ethical self-culture. He estimates the full folly of directing us to fight the legions of lust with out own strength. We can find the path to clean living, he insists, by taking heed thereto according to the Word of God The text-book on personal purity from which we are to learn the every-day lessons of chastity, the inspired writer reminds us, is the Bible.

#### THE ASSAULT ON BIBLICAL MORALITY

It may appear as a flare-back to a discarded creed, this exaltation of the purifying power of the Bible in a day when much of modern thought regards the Scriptures with amused indifference. While the Bible is still the best seller, no book has ever been published against which the barbed spears of unbelief have been flung with greater vehemence.

Baldur von Shirach, youthful Nazi leader, who has been entrusted with the care of the 6,000,000 boys and girls in the Hitler Youth and the Federation of the German Girls, when interviewed in March, 1935, regarding his religious ideals and ambitions, first of all denied that he was interested in reintroducing the Wotan cult into Germany. He continued, however, by denouncing the Old Testament. "Let me say," he asserted, "that my attitude toward the Old Testament coincides with Goethe's as laid down in his Dichtung und Wahrheit. I am frank to say that as leader of the youth I have some misgivings concerning certain portions of the Old Testament, portions in which unchaste and immoral things are told in a way that might prove dangerous to the youthful mind." Equally rabid are the pronouncements of the German Christian Party. This group attacks the Old Testament chiefly because of its Semitic background and seeks to substitute a "pure Aryan spirit" in the worship of the German people.

It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that this hatred of the Old Testament is peculiarly German or specifically Nazi. It has long been championed in our own country. The Living Church, organ of the Episcopal High Church tendencies, refers to the song of Moses and Miriam as "a wild, barbaric folk-tale." A New York publishing house issues a volume entitled A Modern View of the Old Testament for high-school students in which Jacob is pictured as "a contemptible cheat," Samson as "a gigantic, sensual boor," David as "a daring bandit," and Amos as "a lumberjack from the country."

In 1934 a Lansdowne, Maryland, pastor of a Methodist Episcopal church desecrated an Easter service by hurling his gilt-edge Bible across the church auditorium with the challenge: "As I see it, then, the Bible is not the Word of God. The Bible is men's interpretation of the Word of God. Anything reduced to words is imperfect; for language itself is imperfect.... As I look about me and see the institution we call the Church and the book we call the Bible used to restrict man's growth, mentally, morally, and spiritually, to create in him a prejudice against any new revelations of truth, or to enslave human beings in any manner, shape, or form, I feel like saying with all my heart,.. 'Cursed be the Church and cursed be the Bible when used to enslave God's highest creation on earth, to enslave man created in the image of God!'" About the same time an Italian priest in Anticoli Corrado incited his parishioners to gather the Bibles which American missionaries had distributed and to burn them publicly in a flaming auto da fé.

Less brutal, but more insidious is the attack engineered by the high priests of our neopaganism. John Haynes Holmes, pastor of a New York City Community Church, who baptized with rose petals, sneers: "Why should we be satisfied with the damaged goods of the New Testament? After you have rescued a few pages from it, the New Testament is useless. Its psychology is useless, its morals are outworn." The former president of William Jewell Baptist College at Liberty, Missouri, told a Kansas City audience: "The Bible is immoral and a pernicious guide to human behavior of the present day." When a Unitarian preacher agreed that the ethics of the Scriptures "are fortunately not the ethics of today" and that "we have no business dragging them into modern religious educa-tion," he simply repeated the threadbare argument raised in monotonous repetition by the princes of anti-Biblical prejudice.

With essentially the same objective, though with deceptive phraseology, modern pulpiteers continue to reject the Scriptures. They quote the Bible, it is true, but with crossed fingers, as they pull down the Savior's cross on Calvary to raise the double cross of deceit. This assault on Biblical morality is steadily becoming more outspoken. When the Free Thought Press Association belches forth "disclosures" that allegedly will unmask the Bible, we estimate this scurrility by remembering its source. But when the Tuft College Weekly endorses one of these atheistic publications and in its review exults: "The Bible and its teachings have not maintained their hold,.. the hoary book is found not only wanting, but pernicious in some of its teachings," we can understand why some young people are taught to smile at Bible morals.

Let any author so far outrage public judgment that attempts are made to bar his book from circulation, and immediately he will voice loud protests and claim that for the same reason the King James Version should be banned. Read the court record of any book dealer indicted for selling erotic, lust-laden novels of debauch and unnatural sin (if you can still find a court that labels filth by its right name), and you will not proceed far in the defense until you come across gloating references to Potiphar's wife, Lot's incest, or Solomon's multiple marriages.

#### NO CONDONED IMMORALITY IN THE SCRIPTURES

Now, the Bible contains isolated records of seduction, adultery, and unnatural perversions, it is true; but so does the police blotter. Occasionally the Scriptures refer to intimate questions of life; but in fulsome detail professional medical books feature the same in-formation. If issues of the Congressional Record and scientific reports cannot be accused of immorality when they present discussions of subjects never meant for popular audiences or immature minds, on what grounds can the Bible be indicted when at rare intervals it refuses to pass by scarlet, sordid sins without naming them?

It is also a fundamental fact that the Scriptures never glorify crime or delineate it with lines of seductive charm. Libertines keep their distance from the books of Holy Writ because they know that they can find no endorsement on its pages. The Bible not only refuses to place a halo on the sensualist or to laugh away the transgressions of the purity commandment, but it also insists upon condemning impurity without exception or reservation. In not one of the 31,173 verses of Scripture is there any semblance of compromise with lust, but almost one out of every ten of these verses deals with the temporal or future punishment of evil-doers. In not one of the 1,189 chapters does a single episode suggest or encourage immorality, or condone impurity. Even in the few passages which, in historical accuracy, picture moral lapses or ugly sin the constructive purpose is unmistakable. Hence the Bible's outspoken denunciation of impurity has often acted as a powerful restraint. A clergyman of long, intimate acquaintance with the frailties of his parishioners writes: "Beyond doubt many have been kept back from the practice of these sins by the plain things the Bible has said about them. Many others who had already fallen into these sins have been led by the Bible-stories to see their enormity and their frightful consequences and have thus been led to forsake them by what the Bible has said about them. I am not speculating about this, but I speak from a large experience with men and women." (Torry, Difficulties and Alleged Errors and Contradictions of the Bible, p. 60.)

#### A DIVINE IMPULSE TO PURITY

It is no poetic exaggeration, then, when David exclaims: "The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times." The Bible must be pure because it is God's Word; but besides, it is divinely powerful. The Bible not only teaches purity, it actually helps to create purity.

This is the plain assertion of Jesus. On the night of His betrayal, when, as humanity's High Priest, He poured out His soul in prayer to His heavenly Father, He asked this blessing for His followers: "Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy Word is truth" (John 17:17). The Bible, this prayer of the Savior implies, is the means of sanctifying, purifying, cleansing. Before that night of all destiny, when speaking to His twice-born disciples, He de-clared: "Now ye are clean, through the Word which I have spoken unto you" (John 15:3). There are, then, according to the repeated emphasis of our Savior, divine impulses for purity mysteriously inherent in the Word of God.

Experience has shown the penetrating power of this Word, which is sharper than any two-edged sword. A dissolute, sin-bound young man of the fourth century comes under the conviction of sin after he has heard, by chance, a disquieting sermon from the lips of the great Ambrose. As he kneels in a garden, convulsed in the agony of despair, a child's voice calls to him, "Take, read! Take, read!" He rushes off to a friend, takes a manuscript of St. Paul's epistles and reads: "Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof" (Rom. 13:13). He sees his Savior in a new, personal light. Faith is born. In an instant the sun of grace pierces the black clouds of anguish; the stranglehold of sin is broken. The Word has proved its sacred impulses to purity. A servant of sin has become a servant of God. A sensualist has died, but a saint has arisen, and Augustine strides forward in his career for Christ.

In the year 1789 mutineers from the English government ship Bounty, together with a group of Polynesian men and women, settled on lonely Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific. A ten-year orgy of drunkenness and debauchery, supplemented by continued bloodshed, left only one white man with a group of natives. Isolated on that tiny speck in the vast Pacific, his thoughts turned to the Bible salvaged from the wreck of the Bounty. In the study of this Book both the sins of the past and the promise of the future were vividly impressed on his disquieted mind. That was the beginning of a remarkable transformation. Nineteen years later, when a whaling-ship accidentally reached Pitcairn Island, its astonished sailors found a community of thirty-five English-speaking people of high morality. Marriage vows had been introduced and faithfulness to these vows was rigidly observed. Where lust had reigned, virtue was now enthroned. The power of the Book had once more prevailed.

This divine endowment of the Bible is just as potent today in the battle which Christian young people wage in behalf of moral cleanness. Bible-reading exerts a purifying influence upon the soul.

It has been shown that a dozen evil thoughts are capable of reappearing in 479,001,600 combinations and permutations. No human process of mental hygiene can successfully counteract this intricate persistency. There must be a source of superhuman energy — the purifying Word, which first cleanses and then proposes this ideal: "Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things" (Phil. 4:8)

The will to resist evil is likewise strengthened by this refining, energizing Word. When the shock troops of impurity assail the citadel of their high resolve, all normal young people know the treachery of their flesh and the attachments of a seductive environment. The repeated failure of their firmest resolution is summarized in St. Paul's confession: "The good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not, that. I do" (Rom. 7:19). Again it is the Word that reenforces Christian determination; and high-minded, strong-willed young people who have faced temptation and reiected the overtures to impurity will testity that this conquest came not by cool judgment but by some warning, pleading, strengthening passage of Scripture. The symbolism of Holy Writ does not play with meaningless pictures when it represents the Bible as a sword; for as no other weapon it can cut down the forces that would weaken the Christian warrior's will.

More: the Scriptures not only help to check evil impulses; their impressive building power also bestows a divine impetus for the purest attainments of life. Within the covers of our Bible we meet not only a select group of the cleanest minds of all ages, not only the noblest maxims of morality, not only the most consistent praise of chastity and the appeal for its preservation, but also the stimulating power of the Holy Spirit and His divine support for high-souled morality. Besides its warnings and its pleadings, its denunciation of vice and its exaltation of purity, "the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up" (Acts 20:32), offers itself to the youth of our country as the power of God unto their moral salvation.

#### THE CHURCH'S PLAIN COUNSEL

Now, since these claims for the purifying energies of Scripture are valid, — and being the sacred pledges of God, they are always true, — this divine Book should be read with reverent appreciation. Let it not be said in this day, when changed conditions have reduced the number of working hours to an all-time low level, that the Church's youth has not been able to budget its leisure so that there is time for systematic study of God's Book. A Bible kept at the bedside will remind us of Scripture-reading at night and in the early morning. A Testament carried in the pocket will be a constant companion on journeys, vacations, and social visits. A chapter or two a day — and this usually means from five to ten minutes — will add resistance to our moral fiber. The reading of an entire book of Scripture — and many of its books can be read thoughtfully in a half hour or less —will often lift youthful morale to new heights. Regular attendance at Bible class — and Christian congregations should strive to make Scripture study attractive, congenial, and profitable — will strengthen stamina. The reading of the Word in the family circle, by which the home can receive daily guidance and instruction, will help to encircle our lives with courageous trust.

The Church's plain counsel in this search after purity is, then, first of all, the direction which the Scriptures themselves offer.

Read your Bible with a prayer for enlightenment, for the in-dwelling of God's Spirit in your heart and soul, so that you may understand the high mercies of your God.

Read it with reverence; for it offers you God's plan both for the redemption of your soul and the hallowing of you life. Approach this divine truth not in any faultfinding, condescending spirit, but with the acute consciousness that you are in communion with your God, translated into His holy presence.

Read it in solitude. The quiet, contemplative mood that is free from distraction is often required for the fullest blessings.

Read it attentively, remembering that with every word God speaks to you and that the common courtesies which we extend to those who address us must be deepened into alertness when God speaks to our souls. Many have found that by reading the Scriptures aloud they have been able to focus their thoughts more completely on the rich contents of every verse.

Read your Bible intelligently, with the aid of approved notes and commentary helps, so that you will miss none of its sacred treasures and spiritual riches. Acquaint yourself with a concor-dance, with Bible dictionaries, with standard helps. Far better than Marathon races through the Bible, which aim at speed, en-durance, and quantity, is the absorbed, methodical searching of verse after verse.

Read the Bible daily and continually. The sin it helps overcome and the problems it solves are perpetual issues. If you finish a chapter a day, you will have completed the entire Bible in three years. If every day you read three columns of the Old Testament, two of the New Testament, and one of the Psalms, you can complete the entire Bible in a single year and annually find the whole counsel of God for your ransomed and consecrated life.

Read your Bible with personal application, believing that every syllable has been spoken out of the Father's heart of mercy and written in letters of everlasting love for your increase in the stature of purity and holiness. If any open or subtle force seeks to prevent you from applying God's counsel for your problems of purity, tear them out of your heart, no matter how attractive they may appear. Jenny Lind, whose voice enchanted millions, retired from public life at the very height of her concert career and lived almost secluded until the day of her death. When a friend, vacationing with her at the seashore, once put the pointed question, "O Madame, how is it that you abandoned the stage at the very height of your success?" the Swedish Nightingale thoughtfully spoke these words, "When every day made me think less of this," pointing to her Bible, "what else could I do?" If in your life persistent forces seek to entice you from the strength and help of God's Word, cut yourself yourself loose from them, even though there be agony in the severance!

### THE PURIFYING SACRAMENT

This do ye ... in remembrance of Me - 1 Cor. 11:25

It is said that Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, who himself died a martyr's death, always devoted his last moments with Christian disciples about to be martyred to the celebration of the Lord's Supper. At the conclusion of the sacred rite he regularly dismissed his doomed friends with this valedictory: "Now you are strengthened for torture. Depart in the name of God. This food will sustain you so completely that you can endure all martyrdom and suffering for Jesus' sake with patience and rejoicing."

If only for the brunt of battle against the flesh and for victory over temptation young people would find reserve courage and heavenly power in this purifying Sacrament! We lament the neglect of our acres of diamonds, those close, intimate opportunities of life, which are heedlessly sacrificed in the pursuit of some distant will-o'-the-wisp; but Christian short-sightedness never appears more glaring than in the disregard of the sacramental blessings. We read of shipwrecked passengers who drown though life-belts are attached to their bodies; of airplane pilots who crash to terrifying destruction with the ripcord of their unopened parachutes clutched in fear-frozen grip; of derelicts who die of thirst and starvation only a few feet from stores of nourishment and water. Yet all these pictures of defeat with victory at close reach are not as tragic as the frequent surrender to besetting forces of impurity while the sustaining Sacrament, as close to us as our altars, remains ignored or neglected

In the first Church, when men were almost nineteen centuries closer to the impress of our Savior, the Lord's Supper was more thoroughly esteemed in its essential benediction upon Christian life than it is today. We remember the record that the three thousand souls, the harvest of the first Pentecost, "continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread" (Acts 2:42) ; and to emphasize their reverent regard for the sacred Supper, Luke records that they continued "daily with one accord in the Temple, ... breaking bread from house to house" (v. 46). In the face of divergent interpretation these passages seem to imply that the faith of the first converts found daily strength in the grace and power conveyed by the Sacrament.

From documents of the first and second Christian centuries we learn that the Lord's Supper was commemorated every Sunday. As we read these ancient records, we are impressed with the joy and simplicity that marked the Eucharist in those cradle days of Christianity. Those early Christians were eager to receive the seal of the forgiveness of their sins every time they heard the preaching of the Gospel.

This emphasis on the sacramental grace helps to explain the astonishing loyalty, the thrilling fortitude, the exemplary purity, that marked the conquests of the first Church. Their faith deepened by Word and Sacrament, their lives hallowed, after baptism, by Scripture and reenforced.by the Lord's Supper, the members of those first congregations, in spite of evident weaknesses, often attained to a spiritual life that challenges the best and noblest of our age. If we seek an explanation for our dwarfed Christian zeal, the readiness to compromise with the reigning spirit of carnal in-difference, must we not discover an element of this decline in the disregard of the Lord's Supper, in the neglect of sacramental grace, or the unworthy eating and drinking of the body and blood of Christ?

#### "MY BODY ... MY BLOOD"

The profound holiness of the Sacrament serves to emphasize the far-reaching hazards of its neglect and abuse; for Holy Communion is a sacred rite instituted by Christ Himself. On the night of the Passover festival, commemorating the exodus from Egyptian bondage, the slaying of the paschal lamb in every Israelite home and the sprinkling of its blood on the lintel of every Israelite door, Jesus instituted this Sacrament of the New Testament, which was to offer deliverance incomparably greater than that release from Egypt by the hand of the avenging angel of death. In an upper room at Jerusalem, that unmarked sanctuary which will forever be enshrined in the reverent memory of His followers, our Savior gathered His disciples for the Last Supper and their first Com-munion, the sacred meal to be perpetuated through long and aging centuries. Dark presagings agitated His soul. On that last, fateful night of His earthly life, while His intimates and followers were wrangling for future honors, Jesus, anticipating the crushing nature of His Passion, the God-forsakenness of His crucifixion, and the black agony of His death, prepared His legacy to the Church. In this hush of foreboding death He takes the bread on the table before Him, pronounces a benediction, breaks it, and passes it to His disciples with the startling announcement: "Take, eat; this is My body." A moment later He lifts a goblet filled with wine, offers a prayer, and passes it from one disciple to the other as He speaks these solemn words: "Drink ye all of it; this is My blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins."

Bitter disputes have been waged over the interpretation of these short words. Contradictory opinions have split the Christian Church into opposing factions, torn Protestantism apart, and divided families. Yet the words of Christ in this hallowed valedictory of His last hours with His disciples are clear and pointed. They tell us that in this hour of leave-taking our Savior gave to His disciples, and through them to His Church, not merely a beautiful ceremony or a memorial ritual, not simply bread and wine as a symbol or reminder of His body and blood; they assure us rather that with earthly elements, bread and wine, He bequeathed His body and His blood "for the remission of sins."

Do unbelieving minds ask, "How can these things be?" Have logical, analytical churchmen risen up to deny the literal force and the effectiveness of this divine legacy? How tragic if the truths of life were conditioned by our limited powers of perception! A thousand miracles that beggar all attempts at explanation surround us on every path of life; yet we regard them as commonplaces. If unbelief challenges, "Explain this Sacrament, and we will accept it," we can counter, "Explain any spiritual mystery of life if you can. Or, descending to physical phenomena, explain the growth of the seed and the flower. Prove our own personal existence. Account intelligibly for the precision of the stars or, as the Savior Himself challenged, for the movement of the winds." If in all these verities of life we are confronted by inexplicable mysteries, should we not even more readily accept the impenetrable truth of God in the spiritual domain? Above the contradictions of short-sighted doubt and unbelief the serene voice of our Savior calls out to soothe a fretful world: "Marvel not; only believe." And the answer of trusting faith echoes, "We believe, Lord, that here in this Sacrament." As four separate and distinct accounts of the Scriptures assure us, every time we approach the altar for this sacred rite, we receive, above all power of penetration, that most sacred bestowal — Christ's own divine body and His holy blood. In the full confidence of faith, how trivial are all the repeated denials of the Real Presence!

#### CLEANSING GRACE

Our acceptance of the sacramental gift that brings Christ to us must be complete and fervent; for this spiritual cleansing does what all the chlorides, alkalis, and antiseptics cannot do: it removes the stain of guilt and seals the forgiveness of these sins. The implicit, unreserved trust in the Savior's promise that this Sacrament is "for the remission of sins," takes away the curse of unforgiven iniquities from our lives and permits us to depart from His table strengthened and preserved in our faith, and with a benediction of divine peace.

But the Lord's Supper is not only the seal of removed iniquity, it is also the pledge for a sanctified life. Luther exults: "In the Sacrament forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation are given us...; for where there is forgiveness of sins, there is also life and salvation. Whenever Christ is united with us in the mystery of this sacramental union, the divine energy within us, the heavenly incentive to the purer, finer life, is strengthened. Too often the Sacrament is associated with death, though its potency is never stronger than in an active, achieving life. Too often it is reserved for beds of sickness and dying hours, while it should be a constant help in the healthiest and happiest lives.

Those who wilfully despise the Sacrament are never noteworthy for their exemplary lives or for the excellency of their character. Yet those who take God at His word and in grateful faith receive the cleansing, strengthening power of this Sacrament, feel the demonstration of its efficacy in their own lives. The truest and purest lives have been fortified by the cleansing Sacrament; and today the Church promises its young people the approach to the God-pleasing higher levels of life through frequent and worshipful partaking of the Sacrament. Pastors tell us that the record of attendance at the Lord's Table is often a barometer of spirituality. Show us the clean, happy young woman who commands the respect of every one in the congregation or the young man whose straightforwardness is outstanding, and we shall be able to show you young people who know and experience the blessing of the Sacrament. But go to the outer fringe of the Church, where the line dividing the congregation and the Christless world fades away uncertainly, and there you will find the majority of those who come to Communion once a year.

The sacredness of the Sacrament must be recognized in the worshipful preparation for its blessing. The free-and-easy attitude toward sacramental religion has often helped to relegate Communion to the commonplaces of life. The guides for Holy Communion which fifty years ago were conscientiously studied before the approach to the Lord's Table and the questions of self-examination which listed the transgressions of the Ten Commandments with the intent of recalling all sins, — these spiritual precommunion examinations are often neglected. Time was when those who would partake of the Sacrament found opportunity for private, spiritual discussion with their pastor; when Saturday night and Sunday morning were set aside as hours of personal preparation; when breakfast was omitted before the Sacrament; when even the dress of the communicants conformed to the solemn occasion. It may be that the sincerity of our young people, even without this external preparation, is just as strong and genuine as it was in the last century; but those who can trace modern trends will devoutly wish for at least a partial reemphasis of these time-honored preparations for the holy Sacrament.

Above all these externals there must be in the heart of every communicant the prime and essential requisite — faith. Only unbelief and impenitence disqualify us from receiving the blessing of the Lord's Supper, and those who take the Sacrament in unbelief blaspheme the holy Christ. St. Paul's words ring out in clear-cut warning: "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body" (1 Cor. 11:29). But he who knows the precious ransom and redemption of his soul, who is conscious of his own sin and unworthi-ness, repentant of his weakness and shortcomings, but resolved with the help of the Holy Spirit to amend his ways and to live the clean, Christian life, receives in this Sacrament Heaven's strength for earth's conflicts.

#### "THIS DO"

The attack that unbelief has directed against the Sacrament should call forth a higher appreciation of its sacred power. Atheists have stooped to satanic depths, forcing animals to partake of the sacramental elements as mock clergymen read the Savior's words of institution. Clerical apostates have advertised Communion services with soda water or have officiated at sacrilegious rites over the radio. Almost three hundred and fifty million worshipers have had the cup of which Jesus said, "Drink ye all of it," removed from them by spiritual tyranny. In large Protestant denominations sacramental blessings are accorded only incidental regard, and then fundamentally misinterpreted, as men have followed human reason rather than divine revelation. In our own circles we behold evidences of that spiritual lukewarmness toward the Lord's Supper which St. Paul reproved among the Corinthians.

In the face of this ridicule the young men and young women of the Church are asked to show the reverence which the holiness of the Sacrament should inspire. When Frederick the Great, royal
scoffer and imperial cynic that he was, invited his field-marshal, General von Ziethen, to a diplomatic dinner on Good Friday, this veteran of many campaigns asked for permission to decline the invitation, explaining that it had been his custom to partake of Holy Communion on Good Friday and to spend the day in meditation upon his Savior's suffering. At the next dinner, when von Ziethen appeared at Sans Souci, his monarch's first words sarcastically demanded, "Well, Ziethen, how did you fare with your Communion on Good Friday?" a taunt that provoked the smiles of the royal guests. Imperturbed, the field-marshal shook his gray head, bowed respectfully before Frederick, and then with a firm voice spoke these words: "Your Majesty knows that I have never feared any danger on the battle-field or at any other place where the situation demanded that I risk my life for you and for my country.
This resolution guides me even now. But there is One above us who is greater than you and I, stronger that all men. He is the Savior and the Redeemer of the world, who died for you and who has redeemed all of us with His precious blood. I will not permit this Holy One to be violated or ridiculed; for my faith, my com-fort, my hope in life and death, rests upon Him." Frederick was visibly moved by this heroic confession. He rose, offered von Ziethen his right hand, put the left on his shoulder, and declared:
"Happy Ziethen! Oh, that I could believe as you do! I have every respect for your faith. Hold it fast. This will never happen again."

The ridicule that may surround us will die away, too, if our devotion to Christ and our loyalty to the Sacrament is expressed in open and unreserved acknowledgment. We are not called upon to justify the Sacrament, and we owe no one an apology for our faith in its power. Confidently believing that in this sacred act we are granted a means of purifying grace, how can we more genuinely express our heart's gratitude to our Savior for cleansing than by praying for a larger appreciation of this sacramental grace, frequently accepting its benedictions upon our lives?

### CHASTITY THROUGH PRAYER

If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it - John 14:14

One day when Martin Luther found himself burdened with a particularly pressing responsibility, he rose early in the morning with the resolution: "Today I have so much to do I need to spend three hours in prayer." Would to God that young people today would pause in the heat of their battle against the treachery of lust and fortify themselves with purifying prayer! When youth has learned to employ the resources of soul energy stored in the reservoirs of prayer, it has discovered the divine power before which the legions of lust must fall prostrate.

While God comes to us in the Word and in the Sacraments, we come to Him in prayer and, taking Him at His promise: "All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive" (Matt. 21:22), we find that our earnest pleas for strength to resist temptation are answered by His love. To disregard prayer and fight the insidious forces of the flesh without its reenforcement; to be so preoccupied that prayer degenerates into hurried formalism or empty word-making; to stunt our spiritual life by limiting our petitions to childhood rimes, never experiencing a spontaneous outpouring of the heart to our Father above, — this sacrifice of Heaven's promised help means surrender and defeat.

#### PRAYER ASSAILED

As every other part of our Christian hope, this conviction that God answers prayers has been subjected to bitter ridicule. Psychologists claim that what we call prayer is only a superstitious label for autosuggestion and that whatever value may be in prayer — and little it is, they assure us — lies in the energetic, aggressive mentality it may create. The young man who persistently pleads for a pure heart, a pure mind, a pure life begins to apply, they tell us, every day, in every way, better and better psychology. He focuses all his energies on this consuming objective; by oral repetition or mental fixation he convinces himself that he can acquire the victory over vice; and before long he has overcome his temptation and conquered impurity.

This reduction of prayer to the principles of the Coué formula is contradicted by the heaped experiences in every Christian life. In the battle between the soul and the body the spirit is often willing, but the flesh is weak. No psychological innovation can ever remove this basic human weakness. Let the unhappy wayfarer trapped in the treacherous bed of quicksand pull himself out by his own bootstraps if he will; let the becalmed mariner, locked in the doldrums of the breathless Saragossa Sea, set his ship into motion by blowing against the sail; but do not ever make the mistake of believing that you can save yourself from the clutches of sinful desires only by a program of high resolve and strong-willed intention.

Quite modern, too, is the rejection of prayer under the charge that the habit of asking God for blessings robs the individual of his own assurance. The wife of an Eastern professor protested against an illustration in a juvenile book depicting a little boy and girl at their bedside in prayer. She insisted: "To introduce a small child to the idea of an omnipotent Father may easily rob him of his self-dependence. He may form the habit of leaning on some person or power instead of growing up in the belief that he alone must meet and solve his problems. One might jeopardize the whole future happiness of a child by telling him that he is accountable to God for what he does."

At first glance we are tempted to explain away this unnatural criticism by assuming that it comes from a deranged mentality. We are told, however, that the publishers were deluged with so many letters from parents and librarians, likewise averse to the possibility of having little ones exposed to thoughts of prayer, that the book was published without the picture.

This startling attitude is of course nothing more than a modern American version of Nietzsche's superman complex, the echo of Henley's overbearing Invictus:

I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.

As all other philosophies of life that eliminate God and prayer, this doctrine of self-dependence, too, falls into the fatal error of inflating human strength to false proportions. Van Loon's picture of the earth's total population, 2,000,000,000, stored in a huge packing-box coffin, only one half mile in each dimension, should symbolize the frailty of all flesh. The rebukes of an uncontrollable destiny should illustrate how impotent this atheism is that idealizes youth, with a "bleeding head but unbowed," sullenly raising its clenched fist toward the high heavens and challenging God to prove His existence with a stab of swift lightning. Harrowing tales of disaster, eye-witness accounts of sudden catastrophes, death-bed records, and dying-hour good-bys to life, — all show graphically the utter futility of every effort to emancipate mankind from God and to live victoriously without prayer. As long as young people feel the relentless assaults of sin; as long as they realize by personal and painful experience that they can gain the permanent ascendency over animal desires by no endeavor of their own, as intense as it may be; as long as they see that in spite of high-souled resolve the pure life continually slips beyond their grasp, Christian young men and women will be impressed with the unalterable force of Jesus' ultimatum: "Without Me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5). Instead of branding prayer the effeminate resort of a weakling, they will everlastingly thank God for the privilege of securing heavenly support for their earthly problems through their personal communion with Him.

Other objections to prayer are often repeated. Skeptical science insists that many prayers would require God to break the laws of nature; and the very thought of God interrupting His own ordinances to intervene in the private affairs of an individual is frowned upon as preposterous. Summarizing this attitude, Sir J. Arthur Thomson, British biologist, in his book Science and Religion (p. 20), avers: "A well-educated, modern man has the conception of the Order of Nature, from which any providential interference for his own sake is excluded. ... We do not any longer pray for rain." Applying this positior to prayer as a personal purity aid, we are assured with smiling condescension that no young person, however earnestly and persistently he may pray for a clean life, can ever trust in the efficacy of these petitions. For instance, they insist that a prayer for purity requests God to push aside all temptations, to eliminate contact with treacherous friends, immoral entertainment, sexy literature, sordid environment, and to direct in detail the more intimate affairs of the petitioner's life. All this is utterly unthinkable in their fatalistic philosophy, which makes man an accidental cosmic blotch or a chance combination of atoms, and God either a vague, impersonal force or a benign, patriarchal spirit, hopelessly remote from the weal and woe of an individual life.

Every Christian knows with a deep-rooted conviction that he is descended from no haphazard blob of primeval protoplasm; that life is no puppet-show in which men like marionettes are jerked about by the whims of fate; that God, far from being unconcerned about our individual problems, is able to intervene in answer to our personal prayers. He who created the unmeasured universe and made man as His masterpiece can effectually deliver the creations of His love, if necessary even by suspending natural forces.

Would our holy God command us to pray and promise us His attention and answer if prayer were but a vain gesture, an empty ritual, a deceptive superstition? Read sacred pledges like these that come not from the vacillating claims of men but from God's own Word of Truth:

"The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon Him, to all that call upon Him in truth. He also He will fulfil the desire of them that fear Him: He also will hear their cry and will save them" (Ps. 145:18, 19).

"What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them" (Mark 11:24).

"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive" (Matt. 21:22).

As you study the full content of these passages, selected at random from scores of similar promises, you are driven to the conclusion that, if prayer be anything less than that which our Bible and our Savior repeatedly assure us it is, we may surrender forever any and all other Scriptural pledges of our Lord. But because God has commanded us to pray; because Christ has taught us how to pray; because the divine Word promises an answer when we pray; because every young Christian who has been a faithful student in the prayer school knows from personal experience the benefits of this intimate communion with the Father, our chief concern lies not in the endeavor to explain prayer, to analyze it, to defend it, but to believe it and employ it with all our hearts.

#### ARE OUR PRAYERS ANSWERED?

Infidel taunts persist in challenging: "How can you prove that prayer is answered?" "How can you show that petitions for purity and decency will be actually granted?" For decades proposals have been advanced suggesting that the power of prayer be put to a statistical test and subjected to practical experimentation. The British scientist Tyndale, for example, proposes a prayer clinic. Two hospital wards are to be chosen, with the same number of patients in each. A group of collaborators will pray very earnestly for the recovery of the patients in the one ward and remain completely silent concerning those in the other. The specifications of recovery are to be noted in each ward, and scientific deductions made from the data. A different test has been outlined by Dr. David E. Brinton, American anthropologist. He asks that a group of infants afflicted with admittedly incurable diseases be made the object of prayer. If a number of babies recover, the improvement can be attributed to these petitions.

While the force of prayer cannot be measured by laboratory tests, we remember that God has accepted challenges to answer supplication. Once on the summit of Mount Carmel, when the rote of pagan pleas to the Baalim remained unanswered, Jehovah sent fire from heaven in response to the brief petition of His prophet. Today, too, for those who have eyes to see, there are wide-spread demonstrations of the same power. Reviewing his thirty years' pastorate at the temple in Philadelphia, Russell H. Conwell presented this convincing testimony to the blessings attendant upon prayer for marital happiness: "Through those thirty years of the record-keeping there was an average of sixteen marriages a month, or 5,100 in thirty years. The same pastor who officiated at the marriage of the parents in many cases officiated at the weddings also of the children. Not one case of divorce can be discovered and only two cases of estrangement. The records of many praying churches probably show the same conditions." (Effective Prayer, p. 55.)

The assurance that God will grant the entreaties of His young people for purity and chastity, is shown in individual experience. Those who have found self-discipline or psychological approach disappointing or even futile as aids to chastity and have taken this problem to their God in prayer, know beyond all argument that our heavenly Father hears the petitions of His children for the purifying of their souls.

God must answer prayer, for His Word abounds with repeated holy pledges like these:

"If ye abide in Me and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you" (John 15:7).

"Verily, verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name He will give it you" (John 16:23).

"Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son" (John 14:13).

"If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven" (Matt. 18:19).

"If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it" (John 14:14).

These promises come from the lips of our Lord and Savior and are as unchangeable as His divine love. Together with the hosts of other prayer texts from the Old Covenant and combined with the large company of witnesses in the New Testament, these hundreds of verses constitute the arsenal of divine weapons with which we can rebuke puny skeptics and repel the assaults of impurity.

Yes, God answers prayer, and particularly the sincerity of those appeals that beg for strength in maintaining morality. Those who have tried prayer and felt its refining power will agree with this conviction penned by B. R. Haydon to his friend Keats: "Trust in God with all your might, my dear Keats. From my soul I de clare to you that I never applied for help or for consolation or for strength but I found it. I always rose up from my knees with a refreshed fury, an iron-clenched firmness, a crystal piety of feeling, that sent me streaming on with a repulsive power against the troubles of life." (Correspondence, Vol. II, p. 2.)

In his Autobiography (p. 520) H. M. Stanley relates how the answers to his petitions sustained him during the perils of the African-jungle search for Livingstone. He recalls: "On all my expeditions, prayer made me stronger, morally and mentally, than my non-praying companions. It did not blind my eyes or dull my mind or close my ears, but, on the contrary, it gave me confidence. It did more; it gave me joy and pride in my work and lifted me hopefully over the one thousand five hundred miles of forest tracks, eager to face the day's perils and fatigues. You may know when prayer is answered by that glow of content which fills one who has flung his cause before God as he rises to his feet." And in the journey through the lurking jungles of life young explorers forging steadily ahead in their great adventure will similarly discover the uplifting force of constant prayer. They will be able to say with Luther: "I see plainly that God answers prayer. The whole world proclaims the fact.... Whatever aspect matters may assume, we can achieve all through prayer.... Therewith we can accomplish everything and thus maintain what already exists, amend what is defective, patiently put up with the inevitable, overcome what is evil, and preserve all that is good." (Letters of Martin Luther, ed. by M. A. Currie, pp. 231, 384.)

In addition to its answer, unflagging prayer brings marked blessings. The concentration of one's thought on God, the contact with His love, His purity, His holiness; the protest true prayer directs against everything evil, — all this cooperates to strengthen the Christian morale. Well does Sir Walter Scott comment on the prayer of his heroine in The Heart of Midlothian (chapter XIV): "One thing is plain; namely, that the person who lays open his doubts and distresses in prayer with feeling and sincerity must necessarily, in the act of doing so, purify his mind from the dross of worldly passions and interests and bring it into that state when the resolutions adopted are likely to be selected rather from a sense of duty than from any inferior motive." Those who have prayed best have lived best.

#### WHY IS PRAYER NEGLECTED?

If these miracles are wrought through prayer, why is its molding force neglected? Why does the reservoir of this divine energy remain untapped? If a scientist develops a new form of electric or atomic energy, immediately men seek to commercialize the discovery. Yet the energizing resources of prayer often lie unused, with the depressing consequence indicated in the divine rebuke "Ye have not because ye ask not" (Jas. 4:2). Let any faddist break upon the world with a program of mental sanitation that is based on exotic diet, that speculates on the fantastic symbols of Rosicrucianism, or that thrives on the psychical, and he will be acclaimed by regiments of enthusiastic followers. But when in prayer God's own antidote to immorality is offered without enrolment fees, correspondence courses, or Oxford house parties, its soul-strengthening power is often dishonored by neglect, or cast away with scornful disdain.

What prevents young people from acquiring this spiritual subsidy for the purity of their soul? We hardly require the professional opinion of Arthur Holmes, professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, who offers this diagnosis of the first cause: "In this busy age we have no time." It is doubly distressing that in the greatest age of leisure the nation has ever known there seems to be less time for prayer than in the ten-hour work-days and the six-day week of the last generation. An Eastern organization advertises publications offering "700 ways to kill time." Yet in spite of this lavish time excess, prayer often remains restricted to a few conventionalized phrases, quickly spoken and hastily, sometimes thoughtlessly, flung before the almighty God, as though there were some magic power of incantation in the mere recitation of empty syllables.

Still do we not find time for many whims that appeal to shal-low, unworthy interests? There is no time for prayer in many modern lives because often there is no desire for prayer, no consciousness of its necessity. Spiritual indifference always breeds a stubborn disregard of prayer. The drone of dynamos, the whirl of our efficient machines, the slogans of competitive marketing, the siren song of pleasure, the crashing cymbals of men's favorite follies, combine to muffle Christ's solicitous plea "Come unto Me" and His gracious promise "I will give you rest."

There are other hindrances to prayer. John Bunyan writes: "Prayer will make a man cease from sin, as sin will entice a man to cease from prayer" (Works, Vol. 1, p. 65); and it is simply the unwillingness to tear entirely away from the lust of the flesh and the desire for its gratification that drives many young people away from prayers for purity. Because the very act of petitioning the almighty God for a clean heart implies the protest against unclean desires, those who are enticed by sin either refuse to pray or speak half-hearted petitions. In his Confessions (Book 7:2), in which he writes of his unregenerate life, Augustine admits: "I had said, 'Give me chastity and self-control, but not just yet.' For I was afraid that that should assail me in a moment and in a moment heal that disease of lust which I wanted to be faded, not eradicated." In prayer the pure gold of faith shines forth from the impure dross of an impoverished Christian life. Since the litany of an anxious soul beseeching God for cleanness demands a disavowal of uncleanness, we often hesitate to approach God for the removal of the sin we wish to retain.

#### PRAYER THAT PREVAILS

Petitions with the promise of blessing must of course be the free and sincere outpouring of believing hearts. It is true, we start the day and close it with praise and appeal to our heavenly Father, but we need have no canonical hours in which the angelus summons us to prayer. Scores of times during each busy day our thoughts should fly heavenward, and particularly when we feel temptation, we should remember the apostle's emphasis on perpetual prayer: "Praying always with all prayer" (Eph. 6:18).

Our petitions should not be limited to the reading of printed intercessions. Human problems are never exactly the same in two lives, and in the exclusive use of prayer-books there is a danger that we sacrifice some of the personal elements of prevailing prayer. In his protest against book prayer, Luther went as far as to say: "You will never pray anything good out of a [prayer-] book. You may indeed read it and learn how you are to pray and what you are to ask and be urged on; but prayer must come spontaneously from the heart, without any printed and prescribed word. It must find its own expressions in accord with the burning desires of the heart." (Vol. XII, p. 346.)

That Luther did not brand the use of printed prayer with unqualified disapproval is clearly evident from his other writings. In his impulsive way he spurned stereotyped prayer to emphasize the confidential communion with God that is as essential to a pure, abundant Christian life as the free course of warm blood is to physical welfare. One of the reasons many of the prayers for i dean beat fail to being down a full an swiet sobi chem Almi any wording distant from the personal questions of the present day, they are not actually the prayers for the problems of the petitioner. Lost power, miniature ideals, dwarfed achievements, are often to be traced to the diminutive faith that remains inarticulate before God and can only read what others have prayed in situations which may be fundamentally different.

Nor can the mighty rush of prayer that overcomes a hell filled with temptations be found in the swift, smooth, repetition of merely formal prayers. We should certainly never forget our childhood prayers, these full-confident appeals to our Father in heaven which we learned to lisp at our mother's breast. They must be the inalienable treasures which age and advance cannot destroy. For the battles of life, for that personal wrestling with our own baser selves and an enticing world, we must, however, grow in prayer, learning to speak to our God in phrases of our own individual experience and particular needs.

Altogether, then, our prayer for purity must be an evidence of that free access to the Father granted us through the Savior's reconciliation. It must be an echo of the heroic prayer we find in the lives of God's mightiest men, the prayer restricted to no particular place, time, manner, or ceremony, but which, like the confident requests addressed by children to their father, pushes its way to the mercy throne, there to be blessed by answer.

Vitus Dietrich gives this account of Luther's fervor in prayer: "Once I happened to hear him in prayer.... What spirit and what faith is there in his expression! He petitions God with as much reverence as if he were in the divine presence and yet with as firm a hope and confidence as though he were addressing a father or a friend. ... While I was listening to Luther praying in this manner at a distance, my soul seemed on fire within me to hear the man address God so like a friend, yet with so much gravity and reverence, and also to hear him in the course of his prayer insisting on the promises contained in the Psalms, as if he were sure his petitions would be granted." (E. M. Bounds, Purpose in Prayer, page 37.)

When our heart pleas for purifying grace are marked by undaunted assurance of divine answer, we, too, can face the ridicule of chastity and with the triumphant challenge of the great Reformer advance as he did — on bended knees.

## THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST CHRISTIAN MORALITY

### MARRIAGE FROM GOD - NOT FROM THE GORILLA

And God brought her unto the man - Gen. 2:22

Close your eyes and picture a sultry, humid jungle "some 100,000 years ago." Imagine a horde of gorillas, long-armed, slinking anthropoid apes, crashing through a Post-Tertiary thicket in search of food or on the paths of conquest. Look closely, and you will see that this herd moves under the leadership of a big male, the chief of many females, parent of a prolific band of little anthropoids. Look long enough, we are told by many scientists, and you will witness a tragedy which, in the none too modest statistics of present-day anthropology, is said to have occurred "millions and millions of times." As the simian parade moves on, two young males cautiously rise up behind a barricade of the dense thicket and peer with animal alarm at the disappearing horde, - their gorilla father and mothers, their little brothers and sisters! They are outcasts from their own family, banished by the law of the jungle. Depressed by the cruelty of this exile, the pair of ostracized apes lingers too long; for in a fatal moment the patriarch stops suddenly in his lurching, lumbering course. He has caught the scent of the two fugitives, and turning in his tracks, he hurls himself in their direction with a hideous snarl. One of the two, more agile and alert, escapes into the safety of the entangling over-growth, while his hapless brother braces his hairy body to grapple with the clutches of paternal fury. A death-struggle ensues, an elemental, bestial battle between father and son. The outcome is never in doubt; and after a gory, shrieking moment the young gorilla, his receding skull battered, his ribs crushed by sinuous, bone-crunching constriction, collapses into lifeless pulp.

#### THE THEORY OF BRUTE BEGINNING

In the savagery of this gorilla carnage, we have witnessed, the same scientists insist, one of the most important stages in the evolution of marriage. Not the earliest and primal stage, of course, because Westermarck claims that the first traces of marriage "are found in the chelonia reptiles (turtles, tortoises, etc.)," and the Right Hon. Lord Avebury (whose degrees, titles, and distinctions, as listed in his Marriage, Totemism, and Religion, require nineteen finely printed lines) chides Westermarck for his conservatism and contends (o. c., 2): "He might have gone farther and included insects (white ants, etc.)." But the family feuds of these giant gorillas, in which a jealous father kills or exiles his own sons as potential rivals, are scenes from the evolutionists' history of marriage beginnings and have been accepted as truisms by Darwin and his disciples. The "Father of Evolution" declares very pointedly: "Man, as I have attempted to show, is certainly descended from some apelike creature. [Misguided apologists of man's brute ancestry who repeatedly declare that Darwin never taught the simian origin of humanity should reread this pointed statement as well as a group of emphatic parallels.] ... He may not have been a social animal and yet have lived with several wives, like the gorilla; for all the natives agree that but one adult male is seen in a band; when the young male grows up, a contest takes place for the mastery, and the strongest, by killing or driving out the others, establishes himself as head of the community." (Descent of Man, Vol. 2, p. 361.)

The same claim is elaborately presented in a more recent monument to the brute origin of man and his institutions, the prodigious two volumes of The Science of Life, by H. G. Wells, Julian H. Huxley, and G. P. Wells. They picture a more advanced stage in the history of marriage evolution and describe the convention-alizing of these gorilla clashes in the approach to the human. We are now required to go back only some 70,000 or 80,000 years. Instead of imagining the gorilla pack, we are asked to assume a horde of hominidae, our almost human ancestors, hairy (prob-ably black hair, though red is a possibility, we are informed), long-armed, lengthy-fingered, slinking creatures with bent legs, feet turned inward, "a head still set well forward on the neck instead of pillared erect upon it, and a brain of ape standard." Again we see that this family group moves under the leadership of a gangling male, followed by prehuman women and their offspring. Again all mature males are absent; for, the reader is assured in all serious-ness, "the ruling Old Man" is guided by such a fierce jealousy that as soon as male children approach maturity, he drives them away.

Now — and this is the new stage of progress — the hominidae mothers, "after the fashion of most mammals, were disposed to protect and cherish their male quite as much as their female offspring. ... In order to keep their young sons by them, then, it was necessary for the mothers to inspire their young with awe for their seniors, and particularly for the ruling Old Man, and to make the juniors chary of infringing his rights and rousing his jealousy. By example and crude precept the natural awe of the young male for his father's strength and possible rage was given form and direction." And here comes the outcropping of that uncouth blasphemy which all too frequently disfigures modern theorization and reveals the depths to which the evolutionary philosophies invariably lead, the burlesquing of the Scriptures. Composing a studied parody on the Old Testament apothegm "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Ps. 111:10), these Three Musketeers of Materialism summarize: "The fear of the Old Man was the beginning of all wisdom and decency [our italics]... The younger male deferred to the older male; so ... men learned the elements of self-suppression and the idea of sin, and particularly the sin of incest was born in the human mind. So, say the psychoanalysts, the first repressed complexes arose." (The Science of Life, II: 1442,)

From this stage, which, they maintain, must be regarded as the beginning of society ("human society became possible through this primary suppression, and it is hard to imagine how it could have become possible in any other way," l.c.), successive developments followed with inevitable sequence. "As the young man, growing in strength and desire, wandered discontented on the borders of the family territory, he discovered there were other women in the world, women who were not the chief's women, women unprotected by the tabu. ... The young man brought the strange woman home to the tribe or to the outskirts of the tribe, or she came with him without being brought, his own woman. Less typically she beguiled him toward her parent-hearth, her man.

"Out of such crude and obvious occasions, which probably presented themselves in wide variations among the hominidae and were repeated millions and millions of times in the course of tens of thousands of years, ... exogamy [marriage by the acquisition of strange mates] would have crept into existence almost imper-ceptibly" (L.c., 1443).

All developments that follow are only incidental, this theory implies; the semihuman origin of marriage, provoked by a combination of jealousy on the part of a hominidae patriarch and a postanthropoid animal-mother's love of her male offspring — this is primal, basic!

This animal origin of marriage is accepted as one of the canons in the modern study of anthropology. Authors of standard works on matrimonial history unhesitatingly concede the brute be-ginning. George Elliot Howard, in the imposing History of Matrimonial Institutions, concludes (Vol. 1, p. 150): "So we come back to the starting-point.... The results seem unmistakably to show that . .. early monogamy takes its rise beyond the border-line separating men from the lower animals." Edward Westermarck, The History of Human Marriage (pp. 27, 28), agrees: "The marriage of mankind, as we have seen, is not an isolated phenomenon, but has its counterpart in many other animal species and is probably an inheritance from some prehuman ancestor."

A host of professional investigators as well as the inevitable dabblers have followed the trail thus blazed back to the brute. They have begun their survey of marriage with a study of animal mating and have concluded that the biological conditions out of which marriage arose "are rooted in the evolving animal world."

#### MARRIAGE NOT FROM THE APES

We cannot thus exalt the beast, as formidable as the array of its champions may be. This elaborate theory is based, first of all, on the most suspicious sort of evidence. The gorilla parade, this Exhibit No. 1 in the case of Materialism vs. Christianity, is submitted as an unquestionable zoological truth; yet even Lord Avebury admits: "As a matter of fact, however, I believe that among social monkeys no permanent unions really exist. Some species live in large bands containing several old males" (l. c., 17). This simian evidence is garnered almost exclusively from the legends of African natives, who are notoriously imaginative and suggestible.

Among these contradictory claims we note the unbridged chasm which separates marriage from the nearest approach of animal relations. The lifelong companionship of two birds or beasts under natural conditions is unknown; the closest similarity, if indeed we may speak of a similarity, is a seasonal pairing of a somewhat permanent nature. The continuance of the male animal with the female after the young are born, except in the case of birds, is exceptional; and among birds this fidelity maintains itself only from nesting to nesting. The care for the family similarly is quite unknown in the animal world. Among the domestic animals, for example, the mother alone cares for the young, and among practically all animals this care extends only to the young offspring. The differences between brute mating and human marriage are so fundamental that, even to an open mind, the resemblances, overemphasized as they are, appear trivial. The devotion of love, the ideals of constancy, the permanent interest in the family, these are some of the criteria by which the Christian home is irreconcilably separated from the lair of the beast.

The gorilla genesis of marriage is further based upon theories of origins and evolutions that stifle all emotions of pure love. If, as Jacques Loeb, late professor of zoology at the University of California, writes in his biological essays entitled The Mechanistic Conception of Life (p. 62) : "We ourselves are only chemical mechanisms. An idea is caused by chemical changes of the body. All moods are produced by various chemicals called hormones, that are manufactured by the different glands"; if, as Arthur Dendy, professor of zoology in the University of London, King's College, contends in his Outlines of Evolutionary Biology (p. 212): "Such a view of the origin of living things as given in Genesis, including the primal institutions of Eden, could only have arisen in a state of almost complete ignorance"; if the human race and human marriage originated, as all advances in the scheme of evolution, through "lucky strikes" (so Calkins in his Biology, p. 238), and the decisive influence of chance is a "biological dogma" according to Henry Fairfield Osborne, then the tender attachment between two lovers and the emotions of the purest affection are handed down from the beast; then Christian marriage ethics lack so much force and validity that the advancing intelligence of the "cosmic accidents" we call "men" will disdainfully refuse to be restricted by any morality.

We must also be very clear as to the far-reaching implications of this brute beginning. If man is but a highly developed beast, and if marriage is but an exalted form of animal mating, then we must ultimately be ruled by animal regulations and governed by brute impulses. If the love that binds husband and wife together and builds the Christian home as the haven of earth's highest joys is but the refinement of animal rut, an evolution from the biology of the beast, then away with marital law and order! Down with decency and purity and constancy! Let conscience perish and conventions crash! Abandon restraint! Give us a perpetual carnival of promiscuity, lifelong Saturnalia of sin! — These are the logical extremes to which the hypothesis of animality must lead. They are the avowed ideals of those enemies of the human race who, whether they parade in academic garb, operate with the ukases of Russian Communism, or deal openly with the enticements of free love, work in unholy zeal for the annulment of the divine testimonies by which we know that marriage is of God and not of the gorilla.

#### MARRIAGE — A DIVINE BESTOWAL

Because marriage is neither of brute beginning nor of human evolution, it can come only from God; and it is in this light that the Church asks its youth to regard the blessings of Christian family life. It was God who made the race "male and female" (Gen. 1:27) ; it was God who commanded: "Be fruitful and mul-tiply" (Gen. 1:28); it was God who said: "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him" (Gen. 2:18); it was God Himself who brought the bride to her husband in the first marriage (Gen. 2:22); it was God's Word that declared for all ages: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (Gen. 2:24). The pages of the New Testament reenforce this divine institution; for it is Jesus Himself who says that in the beginning His Father instituted marriage (Matt. 19:4 f.) .

It is in this sense that the Church speaks of "holy matrimony"; for as the gift of a holy God this institution, older than all others, began in Eden, in the perfect paradise of a holiness that was the image of God. While the Church cannot, as Roman theology does, call marriage a Sacrament (since there is no outward and visible sign for the grace of the forgiveness of sins as in the case of the two Scriptural Sacraments, Baptism and the Lord's Supper), it emphatically affirms in the face of a growing dissent that marriage is not merely a civil and social arrangement, but that it is, as the beginning of God's revelation says, His divine bestowal.

God being the Originator of holy matrimony, it must be re-spected. Coming from Him who made all things "very good," marriage should be regarded in the light of our wedding ritual, which calls it "an honorable estate, instituted by God Himself." In open protest against the attitude which likes to sneer at mar-riage, make it the butt of miscalled humor, brand it proletariat and bourgeois, we have the heaped statements of Scripture which reiterate the sanctity of wedlock. We see Christ's own high esteem for marriage shown at the very outset of His public ministry. Instead of gathering the multitudes in the Holy City's concourses or of ascending to a mountainous eminence, where He could be seen and worshiped by the masses as He performed His wonders before their curious eyes, He accepted an invitation to a wedding, and there at Cana, in far-off Galilee, He performed the first of those unnumbered miracles which were to bear incontestable tribute to His divine Sonship (John 2:1 ff.). To Him marriage was so sacred that He sternly forbade bungling men to interfere with its divine claims (Matt. 19:6).

Christ's endorsement of matrimony is supported throughout the Scriptures. When the prophets of the Old Covenant sought to impress upon their own countrymen the magnificence of Jehovah's grace to Israel and the mystic union that bound Him to His people, they could find no more fitting symbol than marriage, the intimate union that exists between husband and wife. Long into the New Testament the same exaltation of marriage continues. Writing to the Ephesians (chap. 5:25) and consciously speaking of a great mystery, St. Paul compares the love which a husband bears for his wife to that self-effacing devotion with which Jesus loved the Church. And as the light of revelation illumines the closing pages of St. John's Apocalypse, the bride, the holy Church, gazes along the horizon of prophecy for the coming of the Bridegroom, Christ.

#### THE HOLINESS OF CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE

With the highest blessing of religion thus expressed in the pictures of marriage and family life, with God addressed as "Father" and the redeemed called His "sons," it is doubly evident that the questions of marriage are not themselves subjects that must be avoided. During the Middle Ages an utterly misplaced sense of modesty branded these God-given blessings as at least semicarnal. Prudish Puritans avoided reference to these subjects as though they were impure. Today their modern counterparts find Satan behind sex and discover only vileness in marriage.

The Church must voice its protest and declare without hesitation that marriage as God ordained it, sex as He created it, the family as He instituted it, are among the highest, holiest, and happiest gifts which His omnipotence has bestowed. It is true of course that the purity of the first Paradise has been lost and the original holiness of marriage infected by the virus of impurity, stigmatized by sin. Just as the degeneracy of all other institutions bears shocking testimony to the greed and the vice and the wanton lust of everything human, so today we often have only a pitiful caricature of that hymeneal benediction once pronounced in the sinless serenity of Eden. Instead of preserving the lifelong, harmonious companionship between husband and wite, men invented polygamy; and our country encouraged a riotous sequence of divorce which has well been styled "successive polygamy." Instead of a reign of purity, mutual understanding, and unselfish cooperation we have the regimen of lust, filth, and crime; instead of the natural love of children, a deep-rooted aversion to parenthood. - So terrifying are the consequences of man's rebellion against God!

Yet love, marriage, the home, as originally decreed by the Father's grace, are in themselves institutions to be hallowed, as the goal toward which the faltering feet of searchers after happiness should be directed. Those who by the rebirth of the Spirit have become new creatures in Christ know that in spite of theit weaknesses their bodies are, as St. Paul stresses, temples of the Holy Spirit and that, as the Tabernacle of the Exodus was filled with the glory of God's presence, so the lives of God's children are blessed by the pervading power of the divine guidance. Twice-born young men and women must be guided by the realization that, since marriage with its attendant requirements is of God, it is good and that, while the misery and sorrow into which some marital relations have been plunged are of man, God's children must perpetuate the divine glory rather than the human debauch and strive with Heaven's aid to defeat earth's downward pull.

Because marriage comes from God above and not from man or beast below, it involves moral, not merely physical, problems. A sin against the commandment of purity is a sin against God, not simply the outraging of convention, the thoughtlessness of youth, the evidence of bad taste. The Savior tells us that, when God's children are joined in wedlock, they are united by Him, and beneath the evident strength and love that this divine direction promises is an ominous warning. Those who tamper with God's institution have lighted the fuse to the explosive of retributive justice. Marriage is so holy that of all social sins its violation invokes the most appalling consequences. Sodom and Gomorrah were burned out of existence because of a vile disregard of the holiness of marriage. David's rule over Israel was blackened by his own marital follies and by the royal lust that forgot God and dedicated itself to raging passion. The Hebrew people dropped from the family of nations largely because of the vicious practices associated with the worship of their idolatry. Throughout history red warnings mark the final record of devastated nations that forgot the divine origin of marriage and its holiness.

There is no clearer testimony to this source of marriage than the benison of happiness which it imparts. Only in this light can the beauty and serenity of wedded life be fully appreciated, the succession of joy and tribulation rightly estimated, and besetting pitfalls and temptations avoided. When a young man and woman dedicated to Christ by a living, trusting, intelligent faith kneel before the marriage altar and pray this prayer: "Heavenly Father, as we bow down before Thee in the name of our Savior, we know that marriage is the gift of Thine immeasurable love and we thank Thee that in Thy fatherly wisdom Thou hast brought us together. We are conscious of our own shortcomings; we realize that submerged selfishness will continually seek expression in our lives; but we ask Thee, who hast ordained this estate for our happiness and well-being, that Thou wouldst send us Thy strengthening and renewing Spirit, so that by His indwelling our married life may reecho, incompletely and feebly though it be, the love with which Christ, the Savior of our souls, loved the Church. In every word spoken within our home, in every deed, in every impulse and action of our wedded union, may we find Thee and the holiness with which Thou hast blessed the marriage begun in Thy name. We pledge this loyalty and recognition of Thy love and honor in Jesus' name. Amen," — when two hearts beat in the unbroken unison of this faith, the marriage that came from God will lead back to God, and the home below will be, albeit not flawless and perfect, a miniature of the home above.

### THE SOCIOLOGICAL NIGHTMARE

Avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called. - 1 Tim. 6:20

A century ago, in 1839, Auguste Comte, French scientist, coined a new term. Today, when thousands of words are annually adopted by the English language, the creation of an expression causes little stir, for these words often live only a short life. In Comte's day, however, innovations in vocabulary were taken seriously; and while most of his theories have not stood the rigorous test of the last century, his hybrid, half-Latin, half-Greek term "sociology," which supplanted all other designations for the science of society, survived to designate the study that is occupied with the origin, development, and phenomena of human society.

Even with his advanced ideas (Comte, for instance, projected a thirteen-month calendar) and his liberal notions on religion (Comte is regarded as the founder of the religion of humanity), this word-creator could not foresee the amazing multitude of conflicting absurdities for which many of his less scientific successors would seek shelter under the guise of "sociology." Pandora, classical mythology recounts, opened the box that sent the contagion of sorrow abroad through the world; and Cadmus, the ancients believed, sowed the dragon's teeth that produced a harvest of con-sternation. However, there is nothing mythological about the consequences of evolutionary sociology as it has developed since Comte's day. Its theories have proposed some atrocious immoralities.

The Church has no quarrel with sociology as a purely speculative science; and there have been Christian sociologists who have traced the past of human institutions and anticipated their future in that objective research which is in no way irreconcilable with the tenets of Christianity. But when Comte's term becomes a cover for atheism, anarchism, or free love; when radical sociology becomes a leading factor in the attack on marriage now in progress, the Church parts company with this sociological nightmare.

#### VENEERED SAVAGERY?

In accounting for the origin of marriage, liberal sociology (that is, the attitude which discolors these courses at many of the larger American universities) accepts the brute beginning of man. It takes a primitive apelike ancestor for granted and from this starting-point proceeds to elaborate on the thesis that present-day matrimony is but a social evolution, a developed convention. We are told that our institutions form "just a film of idealism spread over the top of a million years or so of human savagery," that what we of the twentieth century call marriage is a modernized adaptation of habits and customs which can be traced down through the aging centuries to animal-like ancestors.

For instance, in a prospectus of Lilian Eichler's The Customs of Mankind we find these attempts to illustrate the survivals of primitive marriage habituation:

"We like to marry in June. Do you know why? Because there existed in the dawn of life a human pairing-off system which took place at the time corresponding to what is now June.

"We have 'coming-out' parties for débutantes. Do you know why! Because in primitive life the young girl was actually kept in prison until she reached marriageable age; and when she 'came out to be bartered as a bride, there were great tribal celebrations.

"Far back, in the beginning of life, a mother pressed her lips against the lips of her child to stifle its cries and save it from the wrath of the head clansman. That was the dawn of mother-love, the origin of the mother-kiss."

A popularized picture of reconstructed marriage history is drawn in a full-page feature entitled "How Marriage Began," which was syndicated by the Hearst newspapers. We are told:

"It is not hard to reproduce in our minds the picture of the first marriage.

"A savage woman, half human, half ape, with rough, matted locks hanging round her face, sits holding her new-born baby, protecting it from wind and cold.

"It is a queer baby, covered perhaps with reddish hair, its brow no higher than a rat's. Its jaw protrudes; its tiny, grimy hands clutch with monkey power all things within reach.

"Along comes the father, full of plans to kill a mammoth or a cave bear; interested in his stone-tipped club, but caring nothing for the mother, who has been for some time only a whining nuisance.

"He stops for a second to look at the small creature which he has added to earth's animal life.

"Its misshapen skull, ferret eyes, miniature shoulders, — something about it reminds him of his royal self as studied in the pool. He stoops to look closer. His bristly hairs are grabbed, and a weird, insane, toothless grin lights up the little monkey face.

"Then the savage takes a new view of life; there the marriage institution and the marriage problem are born simultaneously.

"Says the mammoth-hunter, with whistling words and hoarse throat-sounds half articulated, 'I like this baby. He's like me. Let me hold him.

Don't you go out with him looking for food and don't leave him alone while I'm gone. I've got a bear located. No one can beat me killing bears. I'll bring the bear's heart to you this evening. You can give this baby some of the blood. It will do him good. Don't have anything to say to that mammoth-hunter in the next swamp. I want you to stick to me. I'll look after you. I have taken a fancy to that baby. He looks very much like me.'

"Off goes the father, and that savage mother in a primitive way is a wife.... Society takes a new turn, and the red-haired baby has done it."

Other sources present equally absurd claims. In _The Social Life of Apes and Monkeys_, by S. Zuckerman, this British zoologist sets up the claim that marriage was originally restricted to one man and woman and seeks to account for monogamy in this way: Since man in the beginning of his emergence from the beast level ate meat and was therefore continually obliged to be on the hunt, it was impossible for him to be escorted by his family when he went out on the quest for food. "It is obvious," Zuckerman maintains, "that he would not have gone hunting if in his absence his females were abducted by his fellows." Therefore, comes the scientific inference, "reason may have forced the compromise of monogamy." A reviewer prosaically summarizes: "All the dizzy heights of romanticism, of the tenderest of human emotions, of culture and the arts, — all indeed that separates man from his primate cousins, — may conceivably therefore have been largely due to the fact that he was not originally a vegetarian."

Even more remarkable are some of the conclusions drawn by Albert E. Wiggam, D. Sc., arm-chair sociologist. He asks: "Is the love of a fireplace, even in city homes, due to some natural characteristic in human nature rather than to childhood memories of home and general social custom?" He answers: "Yes. Most anthropologists believe it is natural because in savage times the men who naturally loved to sit about the camp-fire and counsel with their families, neighbors, and war chiefs tended to survive, while the isolated unsocial wanderer perished. There seems to be something natural about it, or else people in great cities would hardly be willing to pay from one to two hundred dollars a year extra rent for an apartment with a wood-burning fireplace and thirty dollars a cord for wood."

Link by link, then, marriage as we have it today has been welded to ancestral custom, and elaborate theories are built up to explain the development of domestic institutions on the basis of this immemorial usage. At the beginning of human activity, many sociologists assert in harmony with the general program laid down by the evolutionary theory, there was no marriage, simply a chaos of promiscuity. Since this disorder proved unsatisfactory, polygamy, the practice of having several wives at the same time, arose. Largely because of the murder of infant girls a third stage developed, polyandry, in which a woman possesses several husbands. The last stage in this development was reached when the polyandrous rela-tions, because of their patent difficulties, gave way to monogamy.

It is admitted, however, that the path of marriage history is not nearly as smooth and regular as this classification would imply; and in the prodigious literature treating the early family we find many discussions which oppose these theories and complicate the situation. We read of exogamy and endogamy, of totemism and tabu, of group marriage, of the horde and mother right, of time and trial marriage, of kinship systems and marriage by capture, and of other theories based upon the many investigations that have penetrated into the remote corners of the globe. The inferences derived from these social surveys are often contradictory; yet they are united in the conclusion that marriage as we have it is nothing more than an evolved human institution, drastically modified in the past and capable of equally drastic modification in the future.

#### FACTS OR FICTION?

The inevitable procedure in this attempt to demonstrate the evolution of marriage is to refer to the family habits of primitive people and draw the deduction that these are the significant survivals of original customs. Thus certain Central Australian tribes are said to practice communal marriage; the claim is immediately advanced that all marriages were originally of this communal type. An Iroquois warrior of the Seneca tribe and of the Wolf clan is not permitted to take his squaw from the clans of the same name in the other five tribes of the Iroquois; consequently exogamy, the prohibition of marrying within the real or supposed kin, is regarded as primal. The Eskimos of Cape Work feature a ceremonial capture of brides. This is drafted as part evidence for the primitive marriage by capture. In thus finding marriage origins in the modern customs of the Siberian Ostyaks, the Buriaks, Kalmucks, Altaian Turks, the Bantu tribes, the Masai, the aboriginal Austral-asians, and in other barbarian fringes beyond civilization's frontiers there is a fundamental error; for these habits are often nothing more than evidences of moral deterioration. The polygamy that Livingstone found along the Zambesi is no evidence of a primal plurality of wives. It would be just as unwarranted for a later student of history, reviewing the development of law and order in the United States from a distance of, say, 1,000 years, to conclude on the basis of snatch observations that our country originally had no governmental authority, but that this developed through these successive stages: First, the anarchy led by underworld chiefs; then, the wider authority of the gang; subsequently, the improvement wrought by self-constituted, sober-minded citizens; and finally, the judicial system produced by representative government.

Equally faulty is the neglect of the facts which contradict these hypotheses. There is evidence of primitive monogamy in Mexico, Peru, and many widely separated areas; and it is certainly as scientific to employ the multiplied instances of monogamous marriage among ancient non-Christian peoples to show original monogamy as it is to cite pagan multiple marriage as evidence for early polygamy.

Again, incontrovertible facts, not the Munchausenish musings, point to conclusions at variance with the sociological tenets. Archeologists have uncovered the earliest extensive evidences of human civilization and the oldest written records of the human race in the Tigro-Euphrates Valley and in the Nile country. Particularly in the cuneiform records of Babylonia, which have made possible an accurate survey of marriage relations in early days, one seeks in vain for evidence of promiscuity, exogamy, marriage by capture, kinship tabu, and the other elaborate propoundings of the social evolutionists. The Code of Hammurabi and literally hundreds of marriage-contract tablets show us that matrimony in those days of high antiquity was in many ways not fundamentally different from modern marriage. In beginning his essay on the genesis of mar-riage, A. W. Nieuwenhuis, professor of anthropology in the University of Leyden, says (The Book of Marriage, Pp. 53, 75): "Whereas it was formerly believed that a premarriage period could be proved in the case of some of the savage races extant today, this has now been shown to be a mistake." And at the conclusion he summarizes: "What is, then, the result of our glance into the primeval age of man? That the essential relations have from the very earliest times been the same as are found among the highly cultured peoples of today... Marriage can never be looked upon as a mere convention."

Finally, the idea of marriage as a social evolution is ruled out because of the terrifying incentive to the destruction of morals which this theory furnishes. If marriage is a purely human in-stitution, regulated by human attitudes and customs, it has no binding force for any unconventional soul. If the Soviet ruin of marriage is laughed off as an interesting social experiment, there can be no complaint when this ruthless disregard of marital morality leads to national disintegration, disease, and death. If past ages have swung from promiscuity through polygamy to monogamy, there is no reason why a degenerate age of the future cannot swing back. If matrimony is ordained by man, what charge can we lay at the door of any unshackled spirit that follows an individualistic conception of marriage with its ridicule of restraint?

#### A REELING, DRUNKEN SCIENCE

This smiling at immorality has become a mark of radical soci-ology. In Principles of Sociology, by Rudolph M. Binder, of New York University, the red flag of revolt against decency is raised in these inflammatory (and highly illogical) pronouncements: "Monogamy, with its lifelong hold on both parties, is incompatible with personal freedom. Divorce entails expense, trouble, and a certain stigma as long as present social attitudes prevail; it is better, consequently, to have no marriage ceremony at all and simply have those who love each other live together as husband and wife as long as they agree with each other. Monogamy is only a fallacy which many people believe in but few really observe."

In his identically named Principles of Sociology Fred A. Bushee (p. 269), professor of sociology in the University of Colorado, sings this Marseillaise of the marriage revolution: "The demand for greater [sexual] freedom seems sometimes so strong as to threaten the permanency of the family union; yet it is not without its favorable aspects... . The [marital] relationship itself might be improved by ... making it, so far as possible, the expression of voluntary action resulting from mutual attraction of the sexes."

Inseparably linked with this rejection of conventional marriage we find the confident prophecies of a coming era of free love. Edward A. Ross, professor of sociology in the University of Wisconsin, typifies this prediction in his The Outlines of Sociology (p. 394): "The endeavor to institutionalize a thing so intimate and personal as mating... will be abandoned as mankind becomes more enlightened." He foresees the day when advanced thinkers will "anticipate that sex relations between the mature will be but a private matter."

Before this Utopia of sociology is reached, however, a radical program of iconoclasm must be inaugurated. First of all, Christianity must go. Mentors of American sociology have declared:

"Current Christian and Jewish [i.e., Old Testament] teaching as to purity and modesty is all wrong." (Creed of a Modern Sociologist, by Harry Elmer Barnes and L. L. Bernard.)

"No extant moral code, not even that derived from the Bible, possesses divine authority. Jesus was merely a religious reformer.'

"If it had not been for the spiritually unclean and morally dwarfish attitude of the Church as embodied in its obscene morals, we would not now be entangled in these violent and chaotic alterations in behavior which trouble the contemporary scene." (Samuel D. Schmalhausen in Calverton and Schmalhausen, Sex and Civilization, p. 365 f.)

"All sex instruction should be rigorously and absolutely divorced from religion, which has been the source of most of the information about sex in the past and of the physical and psychic misery which has been engendered thereby." (Harry Elmer Barnes, o. c., p. 320.)

"I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion as organized in its churches has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world." (Bertrand Russell, Why I Am Not a Christian.)

#### THE FROTHY PHOBIA OF EPILEPTIC MORALITY

There are depths of perversity to which misguided men may lead themselves; but below there is this subzero level reached by leaders who brand Scriptural principles as conducive to matrimonial misery and defiantly dedicate their efforts to further epileptic morality. One could blame the firemen for the fire, the coast-guard for the shipwreck, the meteorologist for the typhoons, with the same absurd inconsistency which charges the Church with the responsibility for indecency.

We seek almost in vain for an explanation of the infuriated assault against marriage by the shock troops of animalism. One is inevitably driven to ask: Who benefits by these uprisings against morality and conscience? Even self-respecting skeptics have spurned this cut-throat antagonism, admitting the brutality of attempting to rob one's fellow-man of his confidence and comfort. In a recent issue of Neues Wiener Journal Dr. E. Wengraf, self-confessed infidel and opponent of Christianity, presents this incisive denunciation of atheism's program of propaganda:

"All antireligious propaganda, including all attempts to get 'fun' out of religion, is in my opinion equal to a crime. It is immoral as well as abominable. Not because the author of this utterance is an eager believer, — for this he is in no way, - but owing to a simple lesson which lifelong experience has taught him: A religious person, living in the same circumstances as an irreligious one, is decidedly the happier of the two. In my personal indifference and skepticism, that is averse to all positive faith, I often envy those of my fellow-men whose deep religious feeling gives them a firm support in all tempests of life. To make fun of their religion, thus seeking to uproot the peace of their souls, is certainly a shameful endeavor. Although I am opposed to all proselytism, I nevertheless can comprehend that a person who is firmly convinced of soul-saving faith derived from the study of the Bible seeks to convert others. On the other hand, I cannot understand the reason for infidelity propaganda. No one has a right to deprive his neighbor of his protecting shelter, be it ever so deficient, unless he is perfectly sure of being able to offer him a better and more beautiful resort. But to entice others to leave the inherited home of their souls in order to place them in the wilderness of hypothesis and philosophical interrogations, in which they are lost without guidance, – this undertaking is either a criminal fanaticism or a criminal heedlessness."

Thoughtful readers will agree to these charges of criminal fanaticism and heedlessness. Atheistic sociology has been a moving factor in the travail of young souls torn from their Christian anchorage. Denying, as our materially minded sociology does, this foundation truth of a Christian's every-day life that "in Him we live and move and have our being" (Acts 17:28), it has removed the actuating basis of true morality and has become a menace to the society which it seeks to analyze.

### THE COMMUNISTIC SABOTAGE OF MATRIMONY

The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt; they have done abominable works. - Ps. 14:1

A land with fifty-two square feet of floring as the space quota for the individual citizens of crowded cities and with turbulent community kitchens where vigilant housewives tie down the lids of their cooking-utensils so that venomous competitors cannot use them as cuspidors, is not a paradise, but a paradox.
If this land, where the proportion of social diseases is higher than in any other civilized country, be Utopia; if this country, where multi-divorced women change their husbands with the seasons, where the lowest level of marriage morals in modern history has been reached, — if this be the ideal, then the American proletariat must be excused when it exclaims: "Give us our bourgeoisie!" Yet these conditions were recorded by eye-witnesses at the height of Communism's triumph in U.S. S. R., Soviet Russia, press-agented by propaganda and publicized by preachers, as it tried to strangle conventional matrimony.

It may be objected that the Russian upheaval strictly concerns the Russians and that we are separated from Moscow and Leningrad by too much land and water to have Soviet influences leave their mark on our political philosophies. But the world of this new age is not so large that it permits social explosions to blast away the foundations of law and order in Europe without having the tremors reverberate on this side of the Atlantic. Besides, if this convulsion were restricted to the Russians, the hazards of contagion might not be alarming; but the exaltation of the Red banner in China, the communist uprising in Spain, the startling growth of radicalism in France, the revolutionary advance in Mexico, - and now the 1939 German-Russian alliance with the Communist conquests of vast areas in Poland show that in this age of world-consciousness movements of such tremendous proportions cannot be boxed behind the barriers of national boundaries.

#### RADICALISM IN AMERICA

On September 9, 1928, Pravda, official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, admitted: "The world-wide nature of our program is not mere talk, but an all-embracing and blood-soaked reality. It cannot be otherwise. ... Our ultimate aim is world Communism; our fighting preparations are for world revolution, for the conquest of power on a world-wide scale, and for the establishment of a world proletarian dictatorship. Therefore the program of the Communist Internationale is obligatory on all its sections."

These statements, although denied by some American radicals, are not overdrawn. The Congressional committee investigating un-American activities, before it adjourned its first session on July 12, 1934, heard testimony to the effect that in December, 1933, the Third Internationale in Moscow adopted resolutions favoring "the revolutionary way out, the overthrow of capitalism throughout the world." A month later, January, 1934, the executive committee of the Communist Party in the United States, concurring in the purpose of this resolution, reprinted it verbatim. And the Communist Party, in a recent convention, adopted a parallel resolution. — All this in the face of the pledge that no propaganda would be carried on in our country given by the Soviet authorities to President Roosevelt as a condition of American recognition!

How American Communists want to capture the United States is openly discolsed in these undisguised threats taken from Why Communism by M. J. Olgin, head of the Jewish Bureau of the Communist Party in the United States, quoted from Volume 1 of the Dies Committee Report (p. 302) :

"We Communists do not say to the workers that they have to begin the civil war today or tomorrow. We say that the civil war is the inevitable outcome of long and arduous struggles against the capitalists and their state and that these struggles must be made the every-day practice of the working classes... The overthrow of the state power, and with it the capitalist system, grows out of the every-day struggles of the workers. One is historically inseparable from the other....

"There comes a time when large sections of the population say that this simply cannot go on. The Government seems to be entirely unable to cope with the political and social difficulties. The belief of the population in the wisdom and all-powerfulness of the 'men higher up' is shaken. The confidence of the masses in their own strength is growing apace. The struggles of the masses meanwhile become broader and deeper... The clearer the class-consciousness of the workers, the more steeled they are in fighting, the better the revolutionary leadership they have developd, the more capable are they to deal the final blows. ... A time comes when there is a demoralization above, a growing revolt below, the morale of the army is also undermined. There are actual insurrections; the army wavers. Panic seizes the rulers. A general uprising begins.

"Workers stop work, many of them seize arms by attacking arsenals. Many had armed themselves before.... Street fights become frequent. Under the leadership of the Communist Party the workers organize revolutionary committees to be in command of the uprising. There are battles in the principal cities. Barricades are built and defended. The workers fighting have a decisive influence with the soldiers. Army units begin to join the revolutionary fighters. Armed workers and soldiers and marines besiege the principal governmental offices, invade the residence of the President and his Cabinet members, arrest them, declare the old régime abolished, and establish their own power."

We have gages for the numerical strength developed by this agitation in our country. The Congressional Committee Investigating Communist Activities, Hamilton Fish, Jr., chairman, reported to the House of Representatives on January 17, 1932, that, while it could find only 12,000 Communists who regularly paid dues to their organizations, evidence shows that there are from 500,000 to 600,000 communist workers and sympathizers within the United States, including several hundred thousand under voting age in the youth movement. The report claims: "A conservative estimate in New York City alone, including the Young Communist League and the Young Pioneers, would not be far from 100,000." If the Fish Committee's 1932 figure of 12,000 Communists in good standing is correct, then American Communists have experienced more than a 100-per-cent increase within two years; for at the 1934 national convention Earl Browder, general secretary of the Communist Party in the United States, declared that the number of active members had increased to 24,500. He admitted that there were "500,000 Communists in other organizations occasionally under communistic leadership, although not directly affiliated."

The increase in the next two years, from 1934 to 1936, was even greater and brought the total of the enrolled members paying dues up to 40,000. The most startling growth, however, was yet to come; for in April, 1939, an unprecedented figure for the Communist Party's paying members had been reached —75,000! Remember that within seven years the number of officially enrolled Communists has increased over 500 per cent!

It must not be forgotten that there are relatively few Republicans and Democrats who make financial contributions to their party and that the Kerensky government was overthrown by revolutionists whose number was small when compared with the strength developed by the Communist Party in the United States today. There are now several times as many people affiliated with the Communist Party and its allied movements in our country as in Russia before the bloody communist rebellion began its butchery.

Testifying on August 16, 1938, before the Dies Committee on the Investigation of un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States, Walter S. Steele of the National Republic claimed on the basis of extended studies that the un-American forces in the United States (and he referred particularly to Communism) "have attained a membership and direction of over 6,500,000." Mr. Steele asserted: "We will show you that the 75,000 composing the members of the Communist Party... are but a small portion of all the Communist forces in the United States and that they have a direct following and influence of over 800,000 in the New York district alone."

Evidence submitted to the Dies Committee lists more than fifty international Communist organizations in foreign countries that have sections in America. While Congress was told in 1934 that Communism in the United States was divided into twenty-eight districts, in 1938 the number had grown to thirty-five because of increase in membership. Each of these thirty-five districts is divided into subdistricts, sections, as they are called. For instance, New York City has eighteen Communist Party sections.

In their study World Revolutionary Propaganda, Harold D. Lasswell and Dorothy Blumenstock present a detailed picture of radical activity in Chicago. We learn, for example, that in addition to regular public meetings Communists organized, or participated in, 2,088 Chicago mass demonstrations during the five years from 1929 to 1934. Expenses of the party in that city sky-rocketed from $15,500 in 1930 to $64,200 in 1934. In dollars per member, Chicago Communists contributed on the average $20.36 in 1930 and $26.96 in 1934.

Much of the strength developed by these radical forces comes from groups organized for communistic aims, although not integral parts of the Communist Party. The Dies Committee Report (Vol. 1, p. 328) lists by name 640 national organizations which, it is claimed, "are affiliated, allied with, or carry, some phases of Communist Party line in the United States or are cooperating in various ways with the movement as a whole." These 640 are organizations operating among the employed and unemployed, sport groups, cultural groups, legal-aid movements, and atheist organizations. They seek to influence particularly the laboring men, the foreign-born, the Chinese, the Filipinos, the Jews, the Negroes, the newspaper workers, war veterans, sailors, farmers, radio workers, stockyard workers, WPA groups, teachers, and others considered of vital importance for the social revolution. They direct their efforts especially toward the stage, the dance, circulating-libraries, music, gymnastics, soccer, and other recreation.

Radicals avidly read the Daily Worker, the official organ of the party, which features the activities of the Communist Internationale and encourages the labor uprisings in coal-mining areas, textile districts, and other fields of industry. This New York City daily claims in soliciting advertising accounts that "through the organization it influences it covers 800,000 industrial workers in the metropolitan area." It is sold on more than 4,000 news-stands in Greater New York. Altogether, according to the Dies Committee Report (p. 345) :

"There are published in the United States over 600 regulat Communist and pro-Communist line publications, 482 or more in the English language and approximately 100 in foreign languages. In addition, some 100 regularly issued publications are printed in English as well as in other languages in Russia and sent to the Communist centers in the United States for general distribution. ... Add to these the millions of copies of books and pamphlets published and circulated by the Reds in the United States, to say nothing of the millions of agitational handbills, and you may have at least a vague idea of the world's largest monopolized press and propaganda mill, directed at the undermining of American institutions and ideals in the hope that a 'Soviet America' may some day be shackled upon our people."

At its 1938 convention the Communist Party of the United States resolved to distribute 15,000,000 pieces of literature in our country during that year.

Large editions of Stalin's recent book on Lenin and Bolshevism were sold in the United States, chiefly through party book-shops. These distributing agencies, found in all principal cities, cooperate with publishing houses owned and operated by communist forces. A vivid picture of the restless publication activity on the part of Communists is portrayed in Propaganda Analysis for March, 1939 (quoted by permission of the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, Inc.): "Pamphlets, books, newspapers, magazines, and leaflets on Communism pour from the presses by the hundreds, reaching perhaps millions. Last year, with the newspaper business so bad that 29 papers were forced to shut down, the Communist Party nevertheless was able to launch two new dailies. There are communist magazines for children, like the Young Pioneer, communist books for children, like Fairy Tales for Workers Children, translated from the German of Hermina zur Muhlen; there are communist magazines for women, communist magazines on health, communist dailies, weeklies, and monthlies in two dozen foreign languages, including Chinese. In hundreds of factories, offices, and shops Communists surreptitiously issue little printed, mimeographed, or multigraphed papers, which deal primarily with unionization, wages, and hours, and what the boss did last week that was so reprehensible, — papers like the Educational Vanguard, published by the Communists at Columbia University; New Times, published by the Communists on the New York Times; High Time, published by the Communists on Time, Fortune and Life"

Propaganda activity, glorifying the achievements of Com-munism, is developed within the National Guard, the Army and Navy of the United States, relief agencies, and veterans' organizations — all with the avowed purpose of stimulating revolt against law and order, creating class hatred, and alienating American sailors and soldiers from our system of government. Airplanes have scattered inflammatory appeals over Army corps camps. Navy-yard projects have been sabotaged.

The extent to which Communists were able to secure some of the high positions in labor unions, notably the CIO, was emphasized before the Dies Committee. That group of investigators was told that the Communist Party "failed to secure a stronghold in the American trade-union movement until the CIO was organized. Since then the Communist Party has become a definite factor in the American labor movement.... The industrial and political program of the CIO has the hearty endorsement of the Communist Party.... Violent industrial disturbances in connection with the automobile and the steel strike were fostered by Communist leaders and members.... Communists are presidents or other prominent officers of CIO organizations. ... Some 280 organizers in CIO unions, under salary, are members of the Communist Party." (Vol. 1, pp. 95, 96.) "The Communist Party has acquired more power in the last three years — a thousandfold compared with what it had until it was able to use the CIO." (Vol. 1, p. 143.)

One of the outstanding achievements of Communist agitation during recent years has been the systematic capture of pivotal positions in the Federal Government. On September 26, 1939, Chairman Dies declared in an Associate Press dispatch that "the Roosevelt administration had asked the Justice Department to begin 'purging' about 2,850 'known Communists' who hold key government positions." Still people persist in maintaining that Communism is not a menace, when admittedly almost 3,000 of its adherents and agitators can secure strategic positions in the administration of the Government!

Included in the 640 communistically inclined organizations are sixty-two youth movements. In 1936 the Young Communist League counted about 10,000 members. By April, 1939, its roster had increased to 20,000.

Until recently the subversive youth activities were restricted to the twin socialistic organizations, the League for Industrial Democracy and the Young People's Socialists' League, and to two communist groups, the National Student League and the Young Communist League. After the breakdown in 1929 the lean years following offered a strong impetus to radical agitation among the youth. In 1934 the first American Youth Congress (AYC) was captured by Norman Thomas and Earl Browder with such brilliant strategy that the American Youth Communist League gleefully reported this incident to the Young Communist Internationale at Moscow in 1935. Once in control of the AYC, the communist powers allegedly influenced Senator Lundeen to introduce a bill asking for $500,000,000 annually (in the opinion of experts it would demand no less than $3,500,000,000 every year), from which young people would be paid fifteen dollars a week for nominal work. Affiliated at present with the AYC are the Young Communist League, the Youth Section of the American League for Peace and Democracy, the Youth Division of the International Workers' Order, the Youth Division of the National Negro Con-gress, the Workers' Alliance (these five organizations are also officially affiliated with the Communist Party), the American Student Union (controlled by Communists and Socialists), the Young People's Socialist League (a Socialist Party affiliate), the National Student Federation, and the YWCA National Industrial Council. The last two are the only non-radical bodies in the AYC. But the AYC has a sister organization, the ASU, the American Student Union, organized in 1935 for the purpose of fighting Fascism and war. Originally Socialist, it has constantly turned farther to the Left.

Hundreds of Communist schools, vital to the propaganda of the movement, are conducted throughout the United States, where young Reds are instructed in the revolutionary ideals. The outstanding Communist institute in the United States is the Workers' School, New York City. This is the intellectual headquarters not only for many schools in Greater New York but also for scores of other strategically located training-grounds. The claim that 10,000 students of the Soviet system are enrolled in these classes is probably not exaggerated, because the Philadelphia school alone lists "approximately one thousand students." Particularly prominent in the Red educational program are the Communist camps in our country, often conducted under the auspices of the Parent and Children's Camp Association, Inc.

Christianity Today, November, 1931, reports: "Within fifty miles of Boston, Massachusetts, thirty-two Soviet Sunday-schools function, where children are instructed in atheism. In Pittsburgh a Soviet Sunday-school, with an average attendance of 700, is said to meet every Sunday. In these gatherings the children are taught to hate God, Christ, and the Bible — openly." Thousands of Red song-books are circulated, burlesquing such hymns as "Onward, Christian Soldiers." "Give us one generation of small children to train to manhood and womanhood, and we will set up the Bolshevist Sproul, a Boston school-teacher, has become more than a slogan for American Communists. It is admittedly their avowed purpose.

"America will be communistic by 1962." Authority for this radical and dated prophecy is Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, formerly dean of Brown University and president of Amherst College. Speaking before the Rhode Island Philosophical Society, he predicted that this change will come "because we want it and not because of violence." Looking to American colleges as the mainspring for radical currents, Dr. Meiklejohn found "enough ardent Communists on every college faculty to present this minority point of view to the students." Now, if Dr. Meiklejohn were an irresponsible radical, we might laugh off this prediction as an alarmist exag-geration. But when we stop to think that he has received honorary degrees from Amherst, Williams, Mount Holyoke, Brown, Alle-ghany, Vermont, and California, we will not minimize his pronouncements.

Communism does enjoy academic support at the universities of Chicago, Wisconsin, Washington, California, Harvard, Columbia, and at other colleges. In these schools the support is not limited to a few left-wing students. The former president of Wisconsin University is quoted as insisting: "I have said, and still say, a student has as much right to be a Communist as he has to be a Presbyterian or a Baptist." Reporting on this tolerance, the Brunette Committee, investigating communistic activities at State educational institutions, told the Wisconsin Senate (September 21, 1935): "Your Committee found that for several years past the university was being advertised extensively as an ultraliberal institution, in which communistic teachings were encouraged and where avowed Communists were allowed to spread their doctrines on the campus with the permission and connivance of the administration of the university. Your Committee investigated these reports and found that they were true to the extent that they were a matter of common knowledge. Meetings of local chapters of national and international communistic societies were held in university halls. ... That it [the alleged sufferance of communistic in-fuences] was not a true picture of the great mass of the professors, instructors, and students who carried on in spite of un-American influences speaks volumes for the good sense and patriotism of the people of this State."

Dr. William F. Russell, dean of Columbia Teachers' College, (according to a United Press dispatch of February 19, 1939) told a Philadelphia audience that "students of Columbia are being paid $3.00 a day by Moscow to attend school and to agitate.... They have convinced many students that they must join a union for the protection of their interests, and in the union they are inculcated with communistic propaganda."

On October 10, 1935, Langston Hughes appeared as a speaker at a University of Minnesota convocation exercise. Hughes, reputedly an atheist and an acknowledged Communist, is a Negro poet whose poems are now published by the International Workers' Order, Inc. His lines, entitled Good-by, Christ, and another poem, Christ in Alabama, are the depth of blasphemy. His revolutionary verses Good Morning, Revolution are ultra-Red. Within two and a half years, in addition to Hughes, the University of Minnesota students heard, in convocation speeches and otherwise, Earl Browder, Norman Thomas, and Sherman Dryer, all radicals.

Harry Elmer Barnes, radical, atheistic professor at Smith College, told a New York audience: "A hundred years from now Communism may be regarded as more important as a secular religion than as a political and economic force. Perhaps Russia is several jumps ahead of such humanists as Holmes, Potter, and myself. Communism is the great secular religion, with Marx instead of Jahweh (Jehovah), Lenin in place of Jesus, Trotzky in place of St. Paul, and Stalin in place of St. Peter." (New York Herald-Tribune, March 17, 1930.)

The radical spirit has invaded even our high schools. School authorities in Oklahoma City, who investigated rumors alleging the existence of a secret cult in local high schools and adjacent colleges, revealed some startling facts. They discovered in December, 1938, that two high-school students, eighteen and nineteen years old, were leaders, "commissars," of the secret society, which has enrolled twenty-four boys and nine girls. The group had a definitely formulated platform with this pronouncement on sex and marriage: "We talk sex freely in our mixed group. We believe in more sex education and equality for both sexes. We would change the marriage laws to make it easier to get married and easier to separate." Significantly, both "commissars" were known to the police in other respects. They had previously been arrested when it was found that the car in which they were riding contained two high-powered rifles, two automatic pistols, and burglar tools. However, they were released without any formal charge. One of them was arrested and fined two months later on a charge of larceny. The other "commissar" lives with his mother, since his parents are separated. They both boast: "Science has proved much of the Bible to be false and its teachings untenable. We are not going to be stopped by the school board or our parents, because we know we are right." This is no schoolboy prank; for the local authorities have regarded it as so serious that they have issued special appeals. Nor is Oklahoma City an isolated spot in this respect. The same spirit has cropped out in various places throughout the country.

The storm troops of American Sovietism are recruited from the radical clergy. Earl Browder, communist leader, writes: "You may be interested in knowing that we have preachers, preachers active in churches, who are members of the Communist Party. There are churches in the United States where the preachers preach Communism from their pulpits." (Quoted in Isms, p. 192.)

The _Christian Century_ comments editorially: "With a swiftness that few outsiders have yet suspected huge sections of American Protestantism, under the spur of present economic conditions, are shifting to the left. More radical talk and talk more radical is to be heard this summer in gatherings under church auspices than in the councils of any other organizations save only the professedly radical groups."

The Christian Register of October 8, 1931, under the editorial caption "Ministers Russian Sympathizers," glories in this clerical support: "No one who studies the religious press steadily and carefully can doubt that American Protestantism has gone over in its sympathy to the Russian experiment and the basic idea of the Russian philosophy.... Let us thank the Protestant press for the ch ser and the spoken word of the ministers in the pulpits and in all sorts of gatherings."

The zeal with which the formidable array of ministerial protagonists have endorsed the externals of Socialism may be epitomized in the utterances of John Haynes Holmes, pastor of the Community Church in New York City, who reached the clerical climax in the assertion (St. Louis Globe-Democrat, April 8, 1929): "While the Communists have been described as the arch-destroyers of civiliza-tion, I will wager my life that, when one hundred years have passed and competent historians have read the records of these men, they will say that they were the greatest group of statesmen that have ever appeared since the group that organized the United States of America."

#### THE SOCIALIST-COMMUNIST PLATFORM ON MARRIAGE

Those who cannot discern the "blessings" of Communism should not be charged with poor sportsmanship if they are not disposed to accept Mr. Holmes's wager. In the twenty-first cen-tury, of which he prophesies, when the sins of the Red father have been visited on the children of the third and fourth generations, these Soviet atrocities will be cursed by millions; for the foundation of the whole system is built on moldy piles, the infidel disregard of divine ordinances. In no part of its entire revolutionary doctrine is this more evident than in the official attitudes toward marriage.

Here Communism appears in its close relation to radical Socialism. Many otherwise well-informed people believe that there 1s a sharp cleavage between Socialism and Communism. For them the Socialist is a more or less dreamy, humanitarian idealist who entertains vague notions about the distribution of wealth, while the Communist is an uncouth destructionist, next in kin to the Anarchist and the Nihilist. In reality, however, Socialism is the inevitable stepping-stone to Communism, and the marriage and the social laws of Soviet Russia are of course nothing but the application of Marxian principles. Hepworth Dixon, who has spent considerable time in the study of the communistic endeavor, admits: "That you cannot have Socialism without introducing Communism is the teaching of all experience, whether the trials have been made on a large scale or a small scale, in the Old World or in the New." (Spiritual Wives, Vol. II, p. 209.) Labor Age (May, 1931, p. 2), a Socialist organ of our country, brings this unabashed comment under an article entitled "Defending the Soviet Union": "It is surprising that some who call themselves Socialists should be filled with buts and ifs and ands in connection with the Soviet Union. They are affronted because 'the social revolution' did not come in according to a prescribed plan. It should have been led by a lawyer in a cut-away coat, full of ballots and legalisms. Instead it came from the workers and the soldiers, under the sickle and hammer. ... The American workers must be prepared for the attempt at armed conflict.... It is up to the radicals to keep the workers on their toes against any disturbance of the Soviet Union by capitalist attacks." In a similar strain Miss Ethel Mannin, British novelist, writing in the New Leader of February 5, 1932, declares: "As a Marxian Socialist I believe in the inevitability of an economic revolution. But I also believe that, if a bloody revolution were forced upon us of social necessity, as it was forced upon Russia in the grip of the Czarist régime, the bulk of left-wing Socialists, whether they call themselves Communists or not, would not hesitate to fight in the most literal sense of the term." - In the light of these utterances we recognize that Communism and radical Socialism are separated by the technicality of different names. The dictum of Lenin, high priest of Red ruin, remains: "That which is generally called Socialism is termed by Marx the first or lower phase of communistic society."

Both radical Socialism and Communism regard matrimony as a purely human institution, an evil outgrowth of the private-property system. In primitive ages woman, we are told, was the common possession of all men. Those were the days of true Com-munism. But when the specter of private property intruded its forbidding form into this "paradise," capitalism demanded some form of marriage. The stronger the emphasis on personal ownership became, the more restrictive the laws and customs of marriage. With this theory, Socialism and Communism are definitely committed to the dissolution of the bourgeois family and the elimination of all moral questions in marital relations. Marriage laws are capitalistic; women are enslaved by matrimony; men are arbitrarily restricted by its bonds. Emancipation must come.

These thoughts are voiced in almost endless repetition in the radical literature. The well-known Socialist Davidson (Gospel of the Poor, p. 149) writes: Marriage as we know it is only one of the many unwholesome fungi that grow out of the reeking, rotting corpus of private property." E. Belford Bax asserts: "There are few points on which the advanced radical and Socialist are more completely in accord than in their theoretical hostility to the modern legal monogamic marriage." (Outlook for the New Standpoint, p. 151.) M. Gabriel Deville, prominent French Socialist, explains: "Marriage is a regulation of property, a business contract before being a union of persons, and its utility grows out of the economic structure of a society which is based upon individual appropriation. By giving guarantees to the legitimate children and insuring to them the paternal capital, it perpetuates the domination of the caste and monopolizes the productive forces. ... When property is transformed, and only after that transformation, marriage will lose its reason for existence, and boys and girls may then freely and without fear of censure listen to the wants and promptings of their nature." (Quoted by Lecky in Democracy and Liberty, Vol. II, p. 348 f.) Oscar Wilde maintained ("The Fall of Man under Socialism," in the Fortnightly Review, February, 1891): "Socialism annihilates the family life; for instance, with the abolition of private property, marriage in its present form must disappear. This is part of the program." Prof. Karl Pearson prophesies: "Because we hold Socialism will ultimately survive as the only tenable moral code, we are convinced that our present marriage customs and present marital law alike must soon collapse. Women must have economic independence." August Bebel, oracle of Socialism, wrote a prodigious volume, entitled in its English translation Woman under Socialism, in which he asks (p. 344 f.) : "If a Goethe and a George Sand — to take these two from the many who have acted and are acting like them — live according to the inclination of their hearts, ... why condemn in others that which done by a Goethe or a George Sand becomes the subject of ecstatic admiration?" He champions the free-love marriage, the easy divorce, and the complete emancipation of woman from all obligations to the home. He challenges: "Man and woman being animals, can we talk of matrimony or indissoluble bonds? Plainly, no. The woman remains always free, as the man remains always free."

Similar tendencies among American Socialists are evident in their utterances. Dr. Margaret Daniels, member of the Students Council of the National Woman's Party and of the Inez Milholland Industrial Committee, addressing a Mid-Western conference of her party in Detroit, declared: "Banish the home altogether and do away with legal marriage, and both women and men would be free to pursue their careers. The responsibility of a home, the support of a wife and children, are a great burden on a man. This idea of protection for women is a handicap; a woman should be a human being first, free and independent." When asked what would become of the children, Dr. Daniels replied: "Oh, the state would take care of them. You see all women are not natural mothers. Motherhood today is thrust on many women who positively hate their children. The women who are natural mothers should be the progenitors of the race, and the state should support them and their children during the years when the children require a mother's care. A society in which men and women could mate freely and in which women would be economically independent would be healthy." All these scurrilous libels of holy matrimony are repeating the dicta of their master's voice, the verdict of Karl Marx in his communistic Manifesto (1848). In this basic epitome of radicalism Marx indicts "the bourgeois claptrap about the family and education, about the hallowed correlation of parent and child," as "disgusting" and exclaims: "Abolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Com-munists. On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. The bourgeois family will vanish ... with the vanishing of capital."

If this were merely loathsome theory, it could be dismissed as just another sordid, impracticable hypothesis. But we have actual evidence that theory has developed into practice. In Ming, The Morality of Modern Socialism, a section of chapter 3 bears the title "Free Love Actually in Practice," and it shows in incontestable presentation the reign of lust which this radicalism provokes. Typical is the free-love union of Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor with Edward Aveling. Thrown together through cooperative work in behalf of atheism and Socialism, they soon lived together, although Aveling was a married man. When his legal wife died, he discarded Marx's daughter, and Eleanor committed suicide. In 1906, when the Russian Socialist Maxim Gorky sought refuge on our hospitable shores, he was accompanied by Madame Andreiva, who was not his legal wife. This was too much for the better society of our country, and Gorky and his paramour were ostracized. But a kindred spirit, protesting against this discrimination, demanded indignantly in the Toledo Socialist: "Wherein lay Maxim Gorky's fault? What is the height and front of this most serious offending? It is not far to seek. By placing a woman not his legally wedded wife in an accredited position, acknowledging her before the world as his intimate and beloved, he struck an unforgivable blow at that most sacred and most dismal of human relations, the bourgeois marriage."

#### SOVIET MARRIAGE AMORALITY

The most drastic demonstration of communistic antagonism toward marriage is the revolutionary program introduced in Russia. As a fundamental requisite, marriage is entirely divorced from the religious and moral sphere, since the proletariat must be trained to spurn all religious prejudices. Marriage therefore becomes merely a matter of registration; and Soviet education is in principle dedicated to the cultivation of "amorality." In consequence, every semblance of the permanency of wedlock is studiously removed, so that the Soviet states have become the centers for the easiest divorces that civilized history has known. A typical divorce hearing is reviewed by Ralph W. Barnes, Moscow correspondent of the New York Herald-Tribune, in these sketchy lines: "Divorce in Russia is easier than buying a railroad ticket, because it doesn't cost so much. You can be married in the morning, divorced in the afternoon, and married again the next morning, five minutes being occupied in obtaining the divorce. When a wife divorces a husband, the first the husband usually knows about it is when a post-card arrives from the marriage and divorce bureau announcing the fact. Alimony is unknown there. Recently the government has become alarmed at the divorce rate, and it is now trying to persuade young couples to marry, establish homes, and stay married. There might be a great many more divorces than there are if it weren't for the overcrowding. Often a whole family lives in a single room, and if a wife gets a divorce, she may have to go on living in the same room with her former husband, simply because she can find no other place to go." (October 22, 1934.)

Similarly the ties that bind parents and children together, these "survivals of private-property abuse," are to be loosened and then discarded. Public nurseries must take care of infants and children while the mothers contribute to successive five-year plans. Home-life, which in the Soviet mind symbolizes the last stand of capitalism, is to be stripped of its attractiveness. Community barracks have been built. Two or three families are forced into quarters that were originally intended for one, with an actual space allowance definitely allocated to each person. The direct consequence, it is anticipated, will be an unmixed aversion to home-life, and the last-line trenches of capitalism will have been taken.

Woman, merely a chattel under the old régime, is scheduled to reach an absolute par with male competitors in business, in politics, in industry, and in education. The Russian wife, we are assured, is to be the truly emancipated woman, the embodiment of the most fanatical feminist creed. Children particularly must be trained to assimilate the communist ideals. Religion is to be torn out of their hearts and the extremest notions of communistic sex theories inculcated.

With these theories codified into formal legislation, many of them practiced for a decade and a half, skeptical investigators are entitled to ask for a summary of results. The survey presents a revolting orgy of animal lust, almost unbelievable consequences of a moral collapse, which may be tabulated in this catalog of horror:

1.  In all civilized countries Russia has been stigmatized by the unenviable preeminence of having the largest number of girls who become unmarried mothers between the ages of twelve and fifteen.
2.  Russian childhood has become a hideous symptom of the Soviet destruction of the family. Dr. Ivan Ilyin, formerly professor at the University of Moscow, in The Book of the Need of Russian Christianity, drew this horrible picture, which, in spite of recent improvements, shows how disastrous Communism may be: "Out of confiscation, out of impoverishment, out of civil war, out of hunger, out of epidemics of disease, and especially out of the destruction of marriages and family life a peculiar social stratum of neglected children has come into existence in Soviet Russia. Several million of these unfortunate little martyrs, boys and girls from the age of six to eighteen years, wander like Gipsies over the countryside. Without parents, without homes, clothed in rags, filthy, infested with lice, prostituted, infected with venereal diseases, deadening their consciences with cocaine and other drugs, they make their livelihood by begging, by robbing, and by stealing. The government does not know what to do with them. Some 75 to 80 per cent of these children are from the families of farmers and laborers. Unable to cope with conditions, they are dying in need and in misery, but the gaps in their ranks are always filled again by children newly cast off. Their number is estimated at a tremendously high figure by the well-known communistic leader Bucharin. A small number of these children are being cared for in communistic children's homes, where they are introduced to the joys and happiness of education for future Communism."

How a cutthroat attack on Christ is being waged in the unequal battle of Soviet elders against their bewildered children is told by Joseph Duie, former Belgian consul in Russia and representative of the Nansen Mission for the Relief of Famine Sufferers in Southwest Russia, in his Moscow Unmasked:

"Communism in Russia has led to the spreading of depravity, anarchy, and immorality in forms unknown before in the history of humanity. Here is a typical scene of which I was a witness in the village school at the station Tichoretsckaya, 171 versts (102 miles) from Rostov. I was to be present at an inspection of the children in the school. As I knew the place well, I arrived at the school much earlier than the appointed hour, getting there at 9:30 in the morning. I therefore went straight to the class, where the lessons had commenced. Before the teacher's table stood a boy of eight or nine years of age, and facing him were the secretary of the Communistic Party and the teacher of the school. The following dialog took place between them:

"Teacher: "Vanya [John], tell me, do you pray to god?' (The Communists use only a small g for God.)

Child: "Yes, Comrade Teacher, I pray to god.'

"Teacher: 'Does your god give you what you ask him?' "The child is silent, not knowing what to say.

"Teacher: 'If you want to, ask god now for him to give you bread since you are hungry?

"Child: "Yes, I am very hungry?

"Teacher: 'Pray, then, to god; for who knows, maybe christ will give you bread.

"After some hesitation the child goes down on his knees, makes the sign of the cross with his little hands, and bows his head to the ground (which is the custom of the Greek Church), as taught in his own home. It was touching to see the warm and simple faith of the child. The vultures, who are watching him, after a few minutes interrupt his prayer, saying, 'Now, Vanya, has your god given you bread?'

"The child with tears in his eyes, not understanding their real motives and puzzled in his mind, replies, No, god has not given me bread.'

"Teacher: Now, where is your god? But instead of asking bread from him, it would be better if you ask from the Comrade Communist and see what Comrade will give you? The hungry child listens and submissively says, 'Please, Comrade, give me bread.'

"Communist: "If you had done this in the first place, I would have given you bread at once, but you tuned to god. Have you ever seen him? No, because he does not exist.' Then he white bread from his leather jacket and gave it to the child. I could not bear this scene any longer; so I left the school without waiting for the official inspection, and with tears in my eyes I returned to Rostov. Russian children are forced to remain in the hands of such teachers of transgression."

Duie also cites a notorious sex questionnaire officially circulated in Russian secondary schools, attended by children from fourteen to seventeen years of age. He presents abstracts from a book read by Soviet children of even more tender years which prove to be nothing less than a series of vile suggestions and even more despicable illustrations.

3. The respect for parenthood has frequently vanished in a corresponding degree. This characterizes even the highest circles of Sovietism. Thus we are told that Stalin's aged mother, who till her death remained a staunch church-member, had stipulated in her will that 9,000 rubles be set aside to pay for her Christian burial. Stalin, however, disregarded her wishes altogether, appropriated the money, and had her body cremated. Before her death she had expressed the request that not the communistic symbol but the cross of Christ mark her last resting-place. Stalin again followed his own obsessions and placed her ashes in an unmarked grave.
4. The idealism of love has become atrophied. Hideous pictures of perversions are drawn by Seibert (Red Russia, p. 179), who for four years occupied responsible positions as newspaper correspondent.
5. Marriage has become a mockery. According to the Moscow Pravda, again, the scheming Russian peasant can marry a vigorous young girl in the spring, when the farm chores are heavy, and divorce her in the fall, when the harvest has been garnered, thus avoiding the expense of supporting her over the winter. There is no legal compulsion to register a marriage and no legal handicap upon free-love affairs. These outrages have become too intolerable even for Communists. Mme. Passynkova, former member of the Soviet Central Executive Committee, voiced this protest: "There must be some standard. In fact, men and women have now lost all restraint. Many a man has twenty wives. Each one has a child. These are impossible conditions. What can you take from such a man for the support of his children? You can't very well take his hide off. And so the children are thrown into the street to add to the number of homeless little ones." (New York Times, December 27, 1925.) - These conditions have not improved in the last decade; for the St. Louis Star-Times (October 12, 1935) brings this International News Service dispatch from Moscow: "Life has been just one wife after another for I. S. Lapkin... During the days of his marital exploits, Lapkin was an official of a steel-construction works. Authorities charged him not only with using his position to embezzle 7,000 rubles, but also with forcing women employees of the works to marry him. Those who rebuffed him, police said, were summarily dismissed. It was his culice ai divorce he bude, as que day ther the wordine the Tribune, protests: "Today a man eats his breakfast, goes to the movies, gets married, pays his trade-union dues, gets a divorce, - just a string of ordinary events in a single day. A wedding is not considered an important event. It is like going to lunch. Need one be surprised at the large number of operations to prevent birth? Often a woman is afraid to have a child because she has no confidence in her husband. She is his third wife, and how does she know he will not return from his vacation with a fourth wife?"
6. In some months more divorces have been issued than marriage registrations. For instance, the Red Gazette, official journal of Leningrad, stated that during the months of January and February, 1928, 6,896 marriages and 5,007 divorces were registered in that city. In March, 1928, the number of divorces in Moscow exceeded the marriage registrations. (Cf. Colton, The XYZ of Communism, p. 244.) No "grounds for divorce" exist in the new Russia. The cause for legal separation is a matter of private concern or caprice.
7. Russian home-life will soon be but a fading memory if the war waged against marriage is not completely halted. Professor Ilyin (o.c.) writes: "This compulsory quartering in the homes of others and putting of additional roomers into already occupied rooms makes orderly and pleasant family life impossible. Crowded together as in jail, one overhears everything of other people's business and is himself overheard. There is no privacy. One is compelled to live with rough, strange, obscene people. ... Confined space, overcrowding, noise, humming and buzzing on all sides, everywhere disorder, filth, vexation and enmity, gossip and political arguments. It is also reported in communistic papers that, where five or six women use at the same time a kitchen-stove in common, out of pure envy and malice they spit into one another's pots of food, so that as protection against such outrages the women never leave the pots uncovered or open on the hearth, but close them tightly, with the lids fastened with strings."
8. Devastating disease is ruining the vital constitution of the hardy Slavs. Marxism has sown to the wind and is reaping the whirlwind of social diseases. Illegal operations are legalized and, in consequence, during the year 1926 and the first half of 1927 in Leningrad alone some 33,000 requests for the Soviet permission to undergo such operations were made, and 28,000 of these were officially granted. (The Red Gazette, quoted in Colton, o. c., p. 244.) In a copyrighted Science Service article, Marjorie Van de Water describes the plight of Russian youth and says that the mentally ill in Russia are much younger than in the United States. Notable in Russian hospitals and asylums is the large number of patients between twenty and twenty-nine. They are, of course, those who have been victimized by the uprising against morality, which reached its height about ten years ago.

#### THE RECOIL

Under this reversion to barbarity we can understand that there has been a recoil in Russia from these atrocious attempts to socialize woman. Members of the League of Young Communists complained in Communist Youth Pravda, their official organ, that the communist activities absorbed so much time that little interest remains for the home, a condition which provoked a flood of letters particularly from young wives. (New York Times, October 2, 1934.) Answering these letters, one of the most prominent Bolsheviki, Emelyan Yaroslavsky, used the columns of the same paper to set forth "an ideal of marriage strikingly like that of the most respectable bourgeois society." Harold Denny, New York Times correspondent, on October 18, 1934, reviews Yaroslavsky's homily in favor of lasting marriage and describes his position as almost as firm as that of "a good churchman, inveighing against ties lightly assumed and lightly cast aside."

Indeed, Joseph Stalin has now placed underscored emphasis on home influence and has mobilized the membership of the Communist Party and of the young Communist League for systematic support of morals and family life in Russia. On May 8, 1935, the American press printed the Soviet dictator's new program, starting with this key-note pronouncement: "The existence of the family must be recognized and provided for."

Evidence of the extent of this back-to-the-home movement in Russia is furnished by an Associated Press summary from Moscow (November 29, 1935): "Early ideas of reconstructing society around the state at the expense of the family have been cast aside in the Soviet Union. Under the old system, parents, after bringing children into the world, were to be left free of the main responsibilities of their care so they could devote themselves to other duties. Soviet authorities contend that an exaggerated idea of this experiment gained circulation abroad. They do not, however, deny that energetic measures have become necessary to make the family the institution they now want it to be. A whole series of regulations has been enacted recently with this purpose in mind. Parents have been given to understand that they must look to their children's education, must answer for their con-duct, and cannot escape duties of maintenance.... One of the most revolutionary of Soviet revamping measures, placed in effect only a few weeks ago, changed the divorce system. In the past either party to a marriage could obtain a divorce by going to a neighborhood registry office and making known his intentions. The divorce was registered, then the other party was notified that the bonds had been severed. Divorce still can be obtained by either party regardless of the opinion of the other, but now the other party must first be notified."

Even many who are not guided by the standards of Christian morality will find the program of Soviet amorality fundamentally impracticable. Theodor Seibert's Red Russia shows in this instance the failure of Communism's empty theorization. "On a train journey in Siberia I was sitting opposite a young Communist, a provincial, who after the Russian manner talked politics to me for about twenty-four hours almost without pause. A considerable proportion of this exhausting harangue was devoted to denouncing the institution of marriage. My interlocutor was an enthusiastic champion of free love, supporting it by arguments some of which were anticapitalist and others biological... The objections I ventured to raise were brushed aside with the aid of Marxian dialectic. In the end I ceased to argue with the fanatic. Imagine, then, my astonishment when, shortly before we reached our destination, he said with a contented smile: "We shall be in Irkutsk in a few minutes. I do hope my wife will be at the station.'

""What? Your wife? You are married, then?'

"'Oh, yes. I've been married five years, and we've two strapping boys. The elder, writes my wife, keeps on asking for Father.'

"'Look here, my friend, how on earth do you square your family happiness with your revolutionary views concerning love and marriage?'

"'Readily enough. I grew up under the old system and became imbued with its prejudices and erroneous ideals. I love my wife, am faithful to her on the whole, and I am devoted to my children. But the next generation will be quit of all these bourgeois sentimentalisms, just as it will have lost the taste for vodka?»

Applied Marxism leads to delusion and distress. It can never guarantee happiness. The unofficial rumors circulated in the high circles of Moscow, which, however, shun official publication because of the fatal consequences, persist in the theory that Nadejda Halliluieva, wife of Stalin, Russia's dictator, died in the Kremlin by her own hand while Moscow lay hushed in the vodka stupor of the morning after the fifteenth anniversary of the revolution. Equally persistent rumors make the cause for this suicide the Soviet man of steel's consistent application of Soviet marriage theories. A telltale newspaper dispatch from Madrid announced the death of Senorita Carmen Rodriguez, Spanish, radical feminist. As the author of five books advocating birth control and the most extreme theories on marriage and the family, she abandoned Marxism as a philosophy of life that was too tame for her broader doctrines. Of course, she disavowed marriage — until she met a Catalan politician, with whom a romance developed, altogether against her own theories and the fanaticism of her mother. While Senorita Carmen slept on the night of June 8, 1933, her mother, Dona Aurora, to whom she had dedicated her radica! publications, placed an automatic revolver at her daughter's head and pulled the trigger.

#### AMERICA, WAKE UP!

It is disconcerting to note that economic unrest helps the march of Communism in our own country. Greedy capitalists continue to disregard the rights of the laborer, to exploit their employees in industrial servitude, and in this way to add fuel to the fires of un-rest. It is not without profound significance that the libraries of the nation record an unprecedented interest in the writings of Marx and Veblen. In a conservative city like St. Louis the public library reports an extraordinary demand for books on Socialism and Communism during recent years. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch for February 3, 1933, said: "An increase from 25- to 50-per-cent circulation of the works of Karl Marx and other classical Socialists in the last year was reported to Dr. Arthur Bostwick, head of the public library, by branch librarians in a weekly meeting yesterday. One librarian estimated the increase at her branch at 75 per cent. ... Thomas's As I See It was one of the six most-read non-fiction works in July. ... Some librarians observed that readers were disposed to pass from Thomas and other recent writers straight back to Marx... Dr. Bostwick remarked that the increase was an interesting indication, since 'people read about what they're thinking about.'" Pastors have become radical doctrinaires, picketing textile mills or public utility plants, and using any time that is left to preach revolt. Misguided laymen are pleading, as the much-discussed recent Laymen's Foreign Mission Inquiry did, that "Socialism should be appreciated and Communism studied by our foreign missionaries." Professional agitators interpret this objective in its revolutionary consequences, as Professor C. C. Webber, secretary of the World Fellowship of Reconciliation, did when he appeared before the student-body of Colgate Rochester Divinity School (Baptist) on December 10, 1933, and declared that "mis-sionaries should establish birth-control clinics, so that workers can control the population of the world." Well-prepared approach is made to the young people of our industrial centers, and the youth of the rural section is told that low-priced hogs and corn are symbols of capitalistic chaos. Special drives seek to enlist the support of college students and the intelligentsia; and in lines stronger than ever before the charms of Communism are being drawn before the wide and wondering eyes of a discontented age. William Z. Foster, Communist labor leader, viewing his entire life with the background of present-day Russian Sovietism, writes in the concluding chapter of his autobiographical Pages from a Worker's Life: "What a tremendous advance the situation in the Soviet Union of 1939 is over that of 1921! Socialism is victorious on every front despite the bitter resistance of its enemies at home and abroad.... The Socialist sun is in the ascendent, and more and more the Soviet Union is becoming the beacon-light of hope to the oppressed toilers of the world."

The program of radicalism is marked for doom. Within this generation - and this statement springs not from prophetic gift, but from the measure of forecast shadows — the Soviet nightmare will be subjected to such drastic revisions that its flaming red will have been bleached. Dr. William Durant, American Liberal, who returned from a protracted visit to the Red Republic before the scheduled time because Mrs. Durant felt she would go mad if she had to witness the suffering any longer, said that the Russian marriage and divorce system is "biologically unsound and will not last ten years."

The rising tide of radicalism may not be checked in our own country until America has experienced an exhibition of the socialistic annihilation of morals. That end is inevitable; for over the gate that marks the entrance to the communist Utopia of disillusion, far above such gaudy Marxian epigrams as: "Religion is the opiate of the people," the verdict of everlasting truth has chiseled the perpetual warning: "All hope abandon, ye who enter here."

### CAMPUS SCOFFERS

Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. - 2 Tim. 3:7

Twenty-three out of every thousand Americans are college graduates. For every student enrolled in European universities our country has seven. So rapid is the march of enlightenment that, while the average American boy and girl as recently as 1900 had only one chance in thirty-three of entering college, they now have one chance in six. At the beginning of the century our colleges turned out about 15,000 B. A.'s a year. Now approximately 100,000 American bachelors of the arts and sciences are annually graduated, not counting the 25,000 products of professional schools. We are in the midst of the greatest educational era that any country in any age has ever enjoyed.

Inner progress has generally kept pace with this numerical increase. When a university is supported by an endowment of more than $100,000,000; when American affluence can draw to the faculties of our large schools Europe's master minds and the pioneers in new intellectual conquests; when even the smaller colleges are able to select teaching staffs of specialized experts, we have, in spite of some patent weaknesses in cultural mass production, a system of higher education which has deservedly won world-wide rec-ognition. The generous provisions for student aid by educational and governmental authorities, the commodious, sometimes palatial, buildings have attracted a vast army of students.

We are entitled to expect that the influence on marriage radiated by our American colleges should be positive and creative. The broadening of the mental horizon, the contacts with the experiences and expressions of rich minds, these notable blessings should be reflected in an enhanced appreciation of the sacred marriage vows.

#### COLLEGIATE MORALITY

In a general way this reasonable assumption seems to hold. Dr. Kreinheder, former president of Valparaiso University, asserts: "Four years at a college of high intellectual standard, yet pervaded by the spirit of Jesus Christ, will produce not only trained mentality and intellectual grasp but also a deepened spirituality and an emphasized consecration."

In an investigation of 1,600 marriages among friends and relatives of students at Teachers' College (New York) 75 per cent of the educated married women reported their marriage as "un-equivocally happy." Dr. P. Popenoe, director of the Institute of Family Relations in Los Angeles, declares that, while one out of six marriages in the United States ends in divorce, only one out of seventy-five college marriages terminates in this way. Much less enthusiastic, although more detailed, are the findings of Mary Lee in her Harper's Magazine article "College Graduates and Civiliza-tion": "Of twenty-five recent classes at Wellesley, for instance, there were 3,722 graduates, of whom 2,069 are married. Among these there have been thirty-eight divorces and four separations, or one divorce to forty-nine marriages performed. Figures for the United States showed one divorce for every six marriages performed in 1929."

But the case cannot be decided on the basis of faulty statistics. A twenty-five-year average is no accurate gage for present-day facts. A new generation has arisen, and there has been a war. In her delightfully intimate A Girl in the Eighties Miss Conant presents pictures of student life as it was lived in Wellesley during that ante-mauve decade. In one letter she writes:

"MY DEAR MOTHER: March 18, 1883

"What would you like me to write you about tonight in this one-sided conversation? I have just come from the class prayer-meeting. The subject was 'Be careful for nothing.' Such a subject is well for anybody to think about, and it is surprising how much there is in the Bible about not worrying, fearing for the future. We have been studying Matt. 6, which is the plainest on the subject, especially the last four verses. The girls do worry so much here. Girls are apt to worry more than boys, they say. Miss Freeman was saying that there was enough nervous energy wasted in the college to give us all our degrees twice over. Speaking of her reminds me of the reception last night. ... The girls did have such pretty dresses, Mama, it did make me want that dress I wrote you about more than ever. I am glad you think a cashmere would be pretty. I know just how I want it made, quite plain; and if it could be cut and fitted, I could make it with a little help without much trouble or expense. I do not see how I can get along without some such dress, and it seems to me, in fact I know from those who have been there, that the stores in Boston have their spring goods now, and I do not think in Greenfield they would have anything suitable so early. You see, if I do not have it now, I cannot until July; so all next term, when I want it, I would have to wear my black silk. That is handsome and will of course last me a long time, but for the summer I do so want a pretty light dress. Will you not send me the money so I can get it next week Monday when I go to Boston? You see, white is so pretty, and a white cashmere with embroidered trimming I do not think would be common-looking. light-pink would be prettier?" (Page 151 f.)

Contrast this letter with the activities in some of our girls' colleges today. Think of the sex questionnaire circulated at Smith College, the twenty divisions of which asked personal questions that aroused nation-wide protest.

The Church has no desire to frown on the contribution which a liberal education can make in preserving an outward veneer of courtesy and, particularly when prompted by Christianity, in promoting a wholesome regard for the welfare of others. Investigating twenty-three typical colleges and universities, R. H. Edwards, J. M. Artman, and Galen M. Fisher asked the seniors in these schools to report on the moral influences of college life. A substantial majority declared that college education had helped them to improve in fair play, in keeping pledges and paying bills, in their loyalty to home and parents, in their honesty in business deals, and in the use of time.

The same students also admitted that during the four undergraduate years their morality had slumped in some notable respects. Cataloguing this deterioration, 39 per cent of the seniors stated that their morals had declined during their college course because of the use of liquor; 37 per cent, because of the indulgence in disreputable conversation; 33 per cent, because of betting and gam-bling; 25 per cent, because of relations with the other sex.

#### FROM THE LIPS OF CULTURAL LEADERS

Far more bitter charges have been laid at the doors of our modern universities, not by professional reformers but by leaders in our educational endeavors. President M. Leroy Burton of the University of Michigan, for example, read this riot act to his students at Ann Arbor: "You students are lazy; you loaf; you gamble; you spend week-ends in Detroit, and then you wonder why we do not want you here.... I am amazed at the things unmarried men and women will talk about. There are so many fine things in this world that we need not pander to the lower things of life to enjoy companionship between sexes. We have lately seen many things on the campus that would turn red with shame the face of any decent man or virtuous woman."

Dr. Charles J. Smith, president of Roanoke College, Virginia, charges: "The world has never known the turning loose of such an army of hard-drinking, cigaret-puffing, licentious amazons as invade our campuses today."

President Frederick Bertrand Robinson shouted to his students at the College of the City of New York: "The conduct of some of you is worse than that of gutter-snipes."

Now, it has been objected, not that these and similar arraignments of college morals are magnified (for there are too many such charges raised by recognized educators), but that the collegians' behavior is the normal conduct of all young people today. This wholesale attack cannot be sustained. Collegiate immorality is not merely a special brand; it is one of the by-products of the practical atheism that has usurped an unholy control in many college courses. Two decades have elapsed since Prof. James H. Leuba of Bryn Mawr presented data revealing that 86 per cent of American psychologists, 82 per cent of our biologists, 81 per cent of the sociologists, 68 per cent of the historians, and 60 per cent of the physicists denied the existence of God. Since his investigation we find no record of a campus revival or tidal conversion of college professors to Christianity. The dominant tone at some of our largest and wealthiest colleges is unmistakably antichristian; their philosophy of life every-day skepticism.

Some University men are apprehensive of this situation and alarmed over its consequences. Dr. Chauncey Brewster Tinker, professor of English literature at Yale, charges: "Universities fifty years ago were friendly to the Church. You could find there a central, guiding philosophy. Today the schools are full of strange people, who talk of applied psychology, educational methods, and human relations. These parvenus are hostile to Christianity or, at best, indifferent to its existence." (New York Herald-Tribune, May 21, 1932.) Dr. Herman Harrell Horne, professor of history and philosophy at New York University, admits: "Too often we have professors who stand on the side-lines and make wise-cracks about religion. What are we to expect from these institutions if they adopt an antagonistic and negative attitude toward religion?" (New York Herald-Tribune, May 24, 1932.) Dr. Charles W. Gilkey, a religious liberal, dean of the University of Chicago Chapel, attacking faculty encouragement of college infidelity, told the Baptist ministers of Chicago (March 14, 1933): "The enemies of religion are great today; for we have on every campus leaders of student thought who because of something in their own early training think it their special task to free students from religion. There are three of them at the University of Chicago." He then named two instructors, one in the department of philosophy and the other in the department of physiology. With this official recognition of the classroom opposition to Christianity, there is no. further need to debate the imminence of this danger. It has been conceded, deplored, and attacked by university men.

#### PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1

When Al (Scarface) Capone was called "Public Enemy No. 1" to mark his preeminence in the fraternity of Chicago gangsters, the American mind was quick to exploit this catchy label. "Public Enemy No. 1" became the watchword of righteous civic indignation.

That the racketeer who forces helpless shopmen to pay tribute to his piratical "protection" is an enemy of public welfare and that the gangster who mows down innocent pedestrians in his intergang feuds is blasting at the very base of the American structure, is too apparent to require elaboration. But that the killers and their guerrilla warfare are the most destructive of all antilaw-and-order forces; that the Thompson submachine gun and the shot-proof death-car roaring away from the scenes of carnage are the symbols of America's greatest menace, is just another of those exaggerations with which the American public mind likes to be entertained.

The real "Public Enemy No. 1" is the notorious faith-wrecker who sits high in the academic councils, enjoys the plaudits of social acclaim as he hurls anathemas at Christianity, blasphemes God, and shakes manicured fingers at the Bible. The gangland chief, pale-livered coward that he ultimately is, can line up a half-dozen members of the opposing faction and riddle their bodies with a spray of lead, incidentally saving the state the expense of costly prosecution. But these Machiavellis who have dedicated themselves to the unholy task of poisoning the brain and the heart and the soul are guilty of crimes a hundred times more treacherous than gang massacres.

The consequence of this atheism, according to the plain statements of the Scriptures (Ps. 14:1), is corruption and abomination. And in no field of life is the breakdown following the denial of God more definite than in the issues of marriage and the family. Typical instances will illustrate these demoralizing tendencies of campus atheism.

#### CAMPUS RIDICULE OF MARRIAGE

About the middle of February, 1932, the public press of New York City called attention to a new compulsory course for Columbia University sophomores, a study of family relations. At the time it was announced interested students were given a forty-two-page syllabus written by Miss Ruth Reed in which the Christian attitude toward marriage, the home, and family relations was viciously attacked. Overriding the fundamental cleavage between right and wrong, the folder proposed: "The old invidious distinction between legitimate and illegitimate parenthood should be abolished. Every parent who assumes responsibility for the care and future of children should be considered a legitimate parent, and every parent who refuses such care should be considered an illegitimate parent, without regard to legal or religious formalities." Branding the restrictions imposed by marriage as undesirable, the brochure con-tinued: "The family in its present form may be said to serve but inadequately the affectional needs of those who have entered into the relationship." The prospectus also declared that "the married woman who dissipates her energies on petty social and club work and is a parasite on her husband is less worthy than the working bachelor girl who has unconventional relationships with men." - A few weeks later Miss Reed told the Newman Club, a Roman Catholic students' organization, "that she had experienced a complete revolution in her outlook on life; that she had become a devout Catholic and gratefully accepted the doctrines of this Church on marriage." At the same time emphatic protests were made to Dr. Butler, president of the university. These, we may feel sure, are responsible for the changes eliminating many of the objectionable features.

The open ridicule of marriage generally remains unchecked. Tendencies of college anthropology, as taught at Yale and other first-line schools, may be illustrated by the following report from the Chicago Tribune, dated January 7, 1931: "'Affairs without benefit of clergy, but based on love may be preferable to early marriages when couples are inexperienced and not economically independent, declared Dr. Edward Sapir, Sterling professor of anthropology at Yale and former University of Chicago anthro-pologist, in an address at the Old South Meeting House Forum in Boston today. He urged parents to seek to instil 'emotional honesty' rather than the notion of necessity and immediate marriage in the minds of their children and declared, 'The scientist must consider the notion of sin as wholly irrelevant to the present problem.' ... I am rather tolerant toward young men and women who live in what used to be called "a state of sin" if their relationship is based on love,' he said."

The citizens of the Badger State became so incensed over the utterances of certain University of Wisconsin professors that during the 1932 campaign the morals and teachings of the State university became an election issue. "One of the hard-working mothers," writing in the name of the middle-class population of Wisconsin, penned this introduction to a wrathful commentary on Madison student ethics as encouraged by radical university teachers: "Parents of Wisconsin, to arms! Mothers of Wisconsin, you are invited to the University of Wisconsin for Mothers' Week-end in May. It is none too soon. Bring your brooms and mop-pails. There is a great need of spring house-cleaning here. Bring several small pails. There are a few small so-called professors and instructors (especially in the English, dramatic, and psychology departments) whom you will wish to soak overnight in a strong solution. There are many places to be disinfected." Then followed specific charges. In commenting on these, the Madison State Journal (May I, 1932) declared: "What 'A Mother' charges, upon substantial evidence is that propaganda for immorality is going on unrepudiated in and about the university where the sons and daughters of taxpayers, separated from the influences of the home, are subject to the tendencies of the environment in which, in their formative years, they find themselves. We're standing right back of 'A Mother.' ... We charge that atheists and agnostics are being paid with taxpayers' money to teach in the university and that one of them in a magazine of nationwide circulation has just delivered himself of the thesis that there is no God. We charge that a woman student, within the month, has been permitted to flaunt the doctrine of free love in the Daily Cardinal without public rebuke.... If somebody in the University of Wisconsin does not silence those who are ministering to this so-called social revolution, we predict a complete house-cleaning. The Christian fathers and mothers of Wisconsin, schooled in a morality which they believe to be the rock-bottom of any civilization's stability, will not be idle in the matter. If the swing of the pendulum takes us toward destruction, they will stop the clock."

As part of a program to shed light on questions of marriage, family, and the home a lecture was recently featured by the members of the Chapel Union, a non-sectarian religious group at the University at Chicago. Frankly did Mrs. Grace Loucke Elliott discuss the question of premarital relations between young people. When one of the students asked Mrs. Elliott what young people who planned to marry should do if they lack sufficient money, she is reported to have said, "The simplest thing to do is to go ahead and have relations as if married." But she warned against it, stating, "Society does not yet grant you this right. It may some day. You must consider what others will think."

In North Carolina a petition was handed to the governor on September 8, 1932, praying for the halt of the antireligious invasion at the State university and the North Carolina College of Women. Some of the best names in the State were signed to this protest, which declared: "We are registering a solemn protest against the character of some of the instruction that is being imparted to the young men and women attending those institutions — instruction so immoral and pagan in principle that it is destroying the faith and shattering the morals of our young people.... Our courts do not recognize as an excuse for youthful delinquency the professors' claim that students should be privileged to choose the irrational, the immoral, the antisocial, the erroneous, the devil's side of ethical questions as championed by satanic spokesmen." The details of this petition, scoring the attitudes encouraged by certain teachers at these North Carolina schools, are often too pornographic to permit reprinting here.

These protests are not fanatical explosions. There are men teaching or lecturing at colleges whose utterances on questions of marriage and purity will, if carried through, utterly demolish the basic virtues upon which a moral and progressive America must rest.

Here is Robert Briffault, British psychologist, gynecologist, and anthropologist, who lectured at Columbia. In his book Sin and Sex he traces the Christian ideals of marriage largely to early pagan origins; he welcomes "a complete revolution of our archaic marriage and divorce laws"; he believes a new ethical conception will entirely dispose of the old idea of sin and morality.

Here is Prof. Howard M. Parshley of the zoology department, Smith College, who told the American Conference of Birth Control (January 17, 1934): "There is a wide-spread disposition on the part of intelligent, serious, and ethical persons to reject theoretically and in practice what I have called the moralistic view of sex and to regard sex expression as a psychological, romantic, and esthetic aspect of life rather than a peculiarly and specifically moral matter."

Here is Harry Elmer Barnes, professor of sociology at Smith College (divorced at Reno, only to be married there a few hours later), who insists that Christian morality must be scrapped, that instruction in the questions of marriage must be divorced from the Christian faith. American parents will not be encouraged by his picture of tomorrow's college. Starting from the principle that, since students will transgress the moral code, "it is best that they should be safeguarded with the full equipment of knowledge and controlled by a sense of fitness and decency," he shows how the university of the next generation must pander to the desires of its students. He endorses promiscuous intimacies as "a desirable preliminary to the more intimate relations of married life" and quotes with undisguised approval the statements of an unnamed, oversexed University of Indiana student who asks for an all-university love parlor, a collegiate temple of Venus, furnished with famous (or infamous) paintings of love scenes and a full collection of amatory literature.

#### THE LOWEST LEVELS

To come to the lowest levels of the new immorality as advocated by men in close contact with our American college life, we face the theories and teachings of Bertrand Russell and his now divorced wife, Dora Russell. While their influence is not restricted to our American colleges, it is in these intellectual arenas that they have found their largest following. For Russell is frequently heard on college forums, with a few notable universities as exceptions, where neither have been permitted to address the students. Enjoying the clamorous acclaim of many university men and women (a Southern college editor, for example, calls him "a speaker who is acknowledged as one of the foremost philosophers of our day"), Russell tells our young people repeatedly that they need not be guided by any ideals of personal purity. His antichristian teaching excuses lax sex relationships, condones unfaithfulness, and champions adultery.

Dora Russell repeated all these sentiments and asked: "What hinders us from establishing a social system in which young men and women who are out in the world earning may enter into open temporary sex partnership without harm to the work and legitimate ambitions of either?" She brazenly declared: "I believe in having two or three companionate marriages before one settles down. How else can one be sure? Complete inexperience is inadvisable both for men and women when they marry." Unblushingly she confesses: "I would not insist on absolute faithfulness after marriage... Marriage at present is submission to tyranny. It would not be wrong for a man to have six wives, provided he and they found mutual happiness, nor for a woman to have six husbands and a child by each if she and they found such life satisfactory." (New York Herald-Tribune, May 29, 1934.)

Russell, as other leaders in the disintegration of morals, has not hesitated to practice what he preaches. In an address on "China, the Land of Promise and Peril" (in The King's Business, February, 1932), Dr. R. A. Torrey of the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, California, presents this sordid picture: "Two men, one from America and one from England, Professor Dewey of Columbia University and Bertrand Russell of England, have recently been employed by the Chinese Government to lecture in Pekin and the leading cities of China on educational topics. They have had an immense hearing, especially in Pekin. Professor Dewey is frankly unchristian, if not antichristian, and Bertrand Russell is an open and avowed advocate of free love, a pronounced and outspoken enemy of marriage and its obligations. Though a married man when he went to China, he was accompanied by, and lived with, another woman, who accompanied him to China. His wife secured a divorce from him while he was in China, and he continued living with the other woman, but did not marry her, and both he and she lectured in different parts of China in advocacy of free love. He is a brilliant man in many ways, but a grossly immoral man according to Christian standards of ethics. He had a great following in Pekin, especially among the student classes, and a great influence against Christianity and Christian ethics, and his most enthusiastic supporters were the returned students from America. Professor Dewey and his lawful wife traveled from city to city with this man Russell and his paramour and attended receptions where Russell and this woman attended and were introduced along with this disgusting couple."

As the climax of a career molded to his subversive theories came the divorce granted to Dora Russell because of her husband's unfaithfulness. This divorce is the second in the marital and extramarital career of this titled exponent of libertinism. Although this divorce was granted without contest on the ground that he had been guilty of immoral conduct, it did not deter the advocate of freedom in wedlock from marrying again three months later. His third bride was twenty-five years old.

#### THE ACADEMIC BETRAYAL OF CHRIST

The religious bankruptcy which follows this free and easy philosophy of life is the strongest evidence of its depravity. American higher education has loaded upon itself the iniquity of leading college men and women away from God, Christ, the Bible, and the Church. The experiences of Philip B. Wentworth (Atlantic Monthly, June, 1932, "What College Did to My Religion"), who went to Harvard as a prospective Presbyterian clergyman and left it as an atheist, has been repeated in too frequent instances. In Undergraduates, while 55 per cent of the men and 59 per cent of the women interrogated found that college education had made religion a larger force in their lives, others declared that they had lost faith.

Typical are these student confessions (o.c.): "I have completely abandoned all reverence and superstitious awe in my religious belief. I no longer regard preparation for the life hereafter as a dominant motive in life. I believe that religion may be an aid, though it is not a necessity, in living a life of service." "I do not weigh my acts as I did before. This is partly because I have changed my ideas about religion. I am now a Modernist. I do wrong, but it does not bother me as it did before." One third of those who answered the questionnaire confessed that, while at college, they had dropped their belief in the inspiration of the Scriptures. More than one fourth of the students admitted that the scientific courses were the chief obstacles to their believing. More than four fifths expressed their acceptance of an evolutionary hypothesis.

Other, earlier, investigations could be adduced to present even more startling figures. But no one who has lived on a typical American campus can be blind to the faith-wrecking propensities of infidel teachers. Periodically, of course, we are entertained by optimistic accounts which hail the increased interest of the modern liberal college students in the work of the Church; but a survey at Columbia University revealed that motion-pictures were the chief pastime of a representative group of 308 students who answered a series of questions on student conduct. The Church played a rather insignificant and secondary role; for the 150 who had attended the Cathedral of St. John the Divine had gone "in connection with academic work," while the new Riverside Church, with the attraction of Dr. Fosdick, was visited slightly more frequently because of its bowling-alleys and social activities.

#### CHAOTIC CONSEQUENCES

With Christianity gone, moral safeguards begin to disappear. The impressionable freshman who hears his psychology teacher inveigh bitterly against the "superstition of religion" may be persuaded that conscience is only an illusion. Tempted to follow the primrose path across the border-line of morality, he can always find excuse in the sex-saturated course on Freudianism. Biology can always be relied upon to furnish reason why primitive impulses should be obeyed. The philosophy of behaviorism will pleasantly help to dull the sense of marital responsibility; and since all modern science is empirical, they argue, why not experiment in the laboratory of life? Why not twang the harp strings of sensuality as a line from the siren song of Dora Russell recalls: "Animals we are, and animals we remain"?

These effects of the anti-Biblical, antisocial teachings may best be visualized in the statements of students themselves as they are printed in the college papers. After a visit of Bertrand Russell to the University of North Carolina the following appeal for revolt, contributed by a student, appeared in the Tar Heel Topics, the undergraduate vehicle: "Some people can't seem to realize that the days of purity, self-sacrifice, ideals, and all that bunk are gone forever. We are living in a modern world, a world of 'get out of life what you can, and let the devil take the hindermost.' Then, too, that phrase 'doubtful pleasures'! There is no such thing as evil or wickedness — merely the standards of the times in which one happens to be living."

An unidentified junior co-ed at the University of Wisconsin wrote the Daily Cardinal (Madison) a letter scoring virginity and championing free love which cannot be reproduced here. Four hundred members of a recent senior class at Columbia gave answers to a questionnaire on marriage morals which a generation ago would have barred them from decent society.

In a completely unrestrained confession called "Chastity on the Campus" (American Mercury, June, 1938) an anonymous co-ed introduces her defense of free love with these words: "Every third magazine nowadays contains an article on the case for chastity. Since there is a case for chastity, it follows that there must be a case against chastity." And with the charge that "at least 75 per cent of college girls are not virgins," she proceeds to argue against purity and for premarital relations. In voicing the revolt against Christian morality contained in these statements: "To us the idea that the bride must be a virgin is another example of emotionalism"; "We do not have much respect for the marriage ceremony itself," she claims to be the voice of the American campus.

One of the most faithful mirrors of student life and the college attitude toward questions of sex and marriage is found in student-edited publications. In these open forums those views of college morality are aired for which sophomoric ears are eagerly cupped. A few items from our files of recent years demonstrate the tone in typical portions of the student press.

The Yale Record, which in undergraduate life at Yale University is looked on as the publication for expressions of wit, humor, and satire, was banned from New Haven news-stands by the police.

A holiday number of the Pitt Panther, humorous monthly publication of the University of Pittsburgh, was suppressed by Chancellor John G. Bouman because of its cover, which he characterized as "bad taste."

The editor of the Wampus, University of Southern California student publication, was expelled with three others for publishing "shady" pictures in the magazine.

For the first time in its eighty-three years the Nassau Lit, as the Nassau Literary Magazine is known on the campus at Princeton, was barred from circulation.

The editor of the Syracuse University comic magazine, the Orange Peel, was forced to resign because his magazine published the results of a suggestive questionnaire pertaining to student morals.

The editor of Cento, student publication of Center College, Kentucky, was disciplined because of an editorial "Stupidity of Marriage," in which he asserted that marriage "ends in wrecked lives and the casting of ugly blemishes on young lives having to come into contact with it."

A lewd article in Occident, a University of California campus literary magazine, caused the expulsion of its editor because, in the words of President W. W. Campbell, "the article is unbelievably vile. If the pamphlet were sent through the United States mail, the sender in my opinion would be liable to a heavy fine or to a long term of imprisonment at hard labor or both."

Both editor and staff reporter of the Pacific University Index were expelled from the Oregon institution because of an article which college officials claimed to be "destructive to morals, indecent, and obscene."

Student editors of the Harvard Lampoon, humorous monthly, faced criminal action when their magazine was banned from newsstand sale and barred from the mails. Police Chief Leahy (Cambridge, Mass.) said he believed the magazine, its pictures, and other allegedly offensive matter to be obscene and blasphemous.

Speaking at the 1937 baccalaureate services of Lafayette Col-lege, Dean Irving H. Berg, New York University College of Liberal Arts, mercilessly flayed collegiate humor in this summary review: "The so-called humorous publications emanating from various college and university campuses seem to deal exclusively with the subject of sex. This is deplorable. It indicates an attitude of mind which doesn't know what is really funny. Many situations in life are ludicrous; but they are not necessarily nasty."

In this environment, where some professors preach a revolution of morals and their students often try to practice what they hear preached, we find the potentialities of driving disaster. It is the atmosphere in which college killers, prodigies (one, a Phi Beta Kappa student, with a high I.Q.) who gloat over the perversions of human nature, could thrive until the most brutal crime in recent years brought them behind penitentiary bars for life. Breathing this atmosphere, students at the University of Rocheste,r a Baptist institution, formed the Damned Souls Society to prove the necessity of atheism and to abolish belief in God and all religion based on that belief. In New Haven the Yale Freethinkers' Society was organized with twenty-five charter members. In the very State where the Scopes trial attracted world-wide attention a group of students at the University of Tennessee formed a Society for the Advancement of Atheism. All over the country college men have applauded the efforts of the A. A. A. A. for the establishment of atheistic societies in every university. It is in this sophistication of sin, masquerading under the dignity of higher education, that young lives have been ruined and the hope of happiness dissolved in the crucibles of atheistic, antimoral "science falsely so called."

This moral and religious breakdown cannot be checked as long as American colleges aim at the exclusion of Christian ethics from their theories of human conduct. Jesus said: "Without Me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5), and there is no field of human endeavor in which the startling verity of these six words is more clearly demonstrated than in our twentieth-century educational programs. We have concentrated on a pagan development of the brain, with the result that Lord Chesterfield's apprehensions of educating men without religion and making them clever devils have materialized. We train the mind, but not the heart. We impart knowledge, but not wisdom. We strive for the body, but not for the soul. As long as evil is glossed over; as long as human depravity is explained away as a "complex," inherent evil reduced to "bad taste," and sin, to use an academic definition, labeled as the "survival of a medieval superstition by which the Church wields control over its adherents," our universities will continue to produce some of the supercriminals of our age, leaders in the breakdown of the American home and in the demolition of marriage morals.

#### THE CHALLENGE TO THE CHURCH

In raising a voice of warning against this menace, we are not fighting higher education itself. The Church has no quarrel with pure science. It was the revival of true religion in the Reformation that gave real rebirth to a full appreciation of liberal arts. The Church since Luther's day has been a torch-bearer in the darkness of ignorance.

Neither has the Church discouraged college attendance. It recognizes the contribution which intellectual training makes to our country today, when more than 85 per cent of those enrolled in Who's Who and 92 per cent of those listed in American Young Men are college graduates. It has rather encouraged its youth to improve its opportunities and to equip itself for responsible positions of leadership. The one reservation on which the Church has laid unswerving insistence is the avowed recognition that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Prov. 9:10) and the moral basis for the intelligent appraisal of all social questions. It has always extended both a friendly caution against campus attacks on spirituality and a friendly plea for true virtue as St. Paul outlines it to the students in Christ's school of grace: "Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things" (Phil. 4:8) .

It becomes the duty of all Christian students, then, to avoid, as far as possible, those courses where godless teachers have raised the Red flag of radical irreligion; to accept this situation under protest if attendance at these lectures is compulsory; and by personal prayer as well as by faithful worship at church and attendance at the Sacrament to steel their faith against the onslaughts of materialistic and mechanistic philosophies. It is for their moral and spiritual support that the Church has established university chapels in some of the larger educational centers and called student-pastors, whose advice will go far in helping the spiritual life of the student.

Christian parents, on the other hand, should not be unmindful of the advantages which the smaller Christian college lays before them when the question of choosing the school for their children is to be answered. There is a distinct trend toward the revaluation of the smaller school, where undergraduates often receive more individual attention and are better prepared than in the standardized processes of mass education. In these colleges, where the reverent regard of the Scriptures pervades the entire curricular structure and where Christian ethics are emphasized in the relations between young men and women, the nation has a generous supply of that salt of the earth which will help preserve it against the decay of brilliant godlessness.

### THE PERVERSIONS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS

These filthy dreamers defile the flesh - Jude 8

Three weeks after the outbreak of the second World War a Viennese Jew, exiled from Austria after its annexation by Germany, lay in a death coma at Hampstead, a suburb of London. A casual visitor would hardly have realized that the lonely, almost penniless sufferer had for a quarter of a century fought to revolutionize scientific psychology and the accepted standards of marriage morality. Yet that eighty-three-year-old victim of heart disease was Sigmund Freud, — and when he died on the night of September 23, 1939, the father of psychoanalysis, author of twelve heavy books on this new approach to questions of sex, was mourned in many sections of the scientific world.

Freud, characterized by an enthusiastic student as standing in the same relation to the present, old-fashioned marriage attitudes as Copernicus assumed to the narrow science of his day, had become the storm-center around which a bitter battle of conflicting theories rages. To say that this psychoanalysis is discredited is to exaggerate and to ignore the claims of stick-to-the-finish Freudians, like Smith Ely Jelliffe, who asserts: "There is no bit of human behavior, sleeping or waking, sick or well, from the most trivial to the most complex, individual or collective, man to man, woman to woman, or in groups of threes to millions, that cannot be better investigated or understood or guided by inner and enlightened application of the theory of Freud." ("The Theory of the Libido," in Sex and Civilization, p. 471.)

Zealous critics of psychoanalysis may be ready to chant the dirge over Freudianism. Yet it enjoys wide popular support. Even if the meteoric ascent of the Freudian school may be checked, its claims have sickered through to the popular discussions and in this way have become more challenging issues than if they had remained sequestered in laboratories or locked behind academic doors. Freudian expressions, like "the unconscious mind," "libido," "inhibition," "Oedipus complex," "transference," have eagerly pushed their way to prominence in current literature and in classroom lectures. Haldeman-Julius's blue books and dollar-volume publications discuss the theory freely and in a popular vein.

A new guild of professional counselors has sprung up throughout the land, the psychoanalysts, who claim the ability to interpret the suppressed emotions and by this interpretation to offer — at none too modest fees — a scientific solution to domestic and personal problems. Because of the popular attention which Freudianism (and the separatist schools of Jung and Adler) will continue to receive, intelligent young people in the Church who study contemporaneous thought should know the doctrines of psychoanalysis on questions of courtship and marriage. They must understand that, when stripped of its scientific phrasings, Freudianism is one of the most vicious allies of unbridled lust with which any generation of young people has ever been forced into the lists.

#### THE ELEMENTS OF FREUDIANISM

What is psychoanalysis, and how does it affect the morals of marriage? I may be taken to task for proposing these questions and be charged with leading my readers into realms with which they might otherwise remain unfamiliar. Yet correspondence and contact with representative young men and women of the Church show that they are asking pointed questions regarding Freud and psychoanalysis. The Church must offer a sane analysis and estimate of the tendencies with which youth is confronted; for if the Church fails in this duty, as distasteful as it often is, to whom may inquiring minds be directed?

It may be said that Freud's is the psychology of sex and of the subconscious mind, the theory that among all instincts sex dominates and is the ultimate motivation in all human actions, the mainspring of all human behavior in business and pleasure, work and study, health and sickness, thought and action, waking and sleeping.

Freud's conception of the conscious mind has well been compared to the exposed part of an iceberg, which represents only a small part of the whole. The subconscious or unconscious mind, however, corresponds to the submerged section of the iceberg; and just as that invisible portion controls the direction and movement of the entire drift, so the unconscious mind determines the actions and characteristics of the individual. The dominating impulse of this unconscious mind is sex. Conventions of civilization, psychoanalysts claim, have combined to make men repress these unconscious desires. Repressions produce a long catalog of complexes which psychoanalysis has brought to light and which are expressed particularly in dreams when the unconscious mind has free play. Basic is the Oedipus complex (named after the fatigue of Greed mythology who unwittingly not only killed his father but also married his mother), which, Freud asserts, is responsible for many of our inner conflicts.

This sounds rather abstruse and remote; not so, however, is the application of these claims to daily life, where psychoanalysis is held as the cure-all for courtship problems and domestic ills, the scientific way out of perplexing family dilemmas. A wife who is unhappy in marriage and entertains the prospect of divorce is invited to be psychoanalyzed. What happens? A writer in one of our popular magazines gives the facts: "About two years ago I wrote and asked one of the leading psychoanalysts in New York City whether he would tell me how much it would cost and how much time it would take for me to be psychoanalyzed. A letter came from him asking that I go to his office to talk it over. He gave me an appointment, twelve o'clock, Tuesday. So I went. After a short wait the psychoanalyst appeared and led me to his inner office. He was a man of sixty (he had originally been a successful neurologist). He was pale and fat, with ill-defined features, like those of a jolly monk, or friar. He asked me to sit down. Then, getting out pen and paper, he proceeded to question me, writing down my answers. There were all sorts of questions. This was to learn from what sort of family I had sprung. How many brothers and sisters? Where did I come in the family? Oldest or youngest, or third or fourth child? Among other things he asked me how I made a living and how much my income was. After about thirty-five questions (some of which I blushed to answer) and taking copious notes, he told me that, since I was far from rich and worked in an office, he would undertake to psychoanalyze me for only $250 a month instead of $300 a month and that I would have to come to him for an hour every day, six days in the week. The entire analysis, he said, might take a year. On the other hand, it might take two years or more. I tell this just to show that the process isn't cheap. Incidentally, several days later I received a bill from the psychoanalyst (I had been in his office twenty minutes) for twenty dollars." The treatment is long and expensive. The New York Times, August 9, 1936, com-ments: "Country practitioners, glad to get fifty cents for visiting a sick patient on a farm, will gasp when they learn that a psychoanalyst often collects from $5,000 to $6,000 a case. A sitting costs the patient somewhat less than $10 on the average, with about 250 to 270 sittings in a year. A course of treatment lasts from a year and a half to two years."

Had these visits been continued, a long, intimate, unrestrained questioning would have followed, in which past experiences would be revived, dreams retold, fears classified, wishes analyzed. One of the professional devices is to secure the complete relaxation of the patient, who sits in a well-cushioned chair or reclines on a divan in a room, often dimly lighted or decorated to reduce distraction. The psychoanalyst tries to probe beneath the conscious mind by suggesting a list of disconnected subjects and noting the patient's reaction. To the extent that the "doctor" is able to secure unreserved mental reactions and associations, as embarrassing as they may be, the analysis, we are told, will be successful. (Significantly an adaptation of this system is suggested by the Subcommittee of the Federal Council of Churches [Young People's Relationships]. The Young Men's Christian Association Press has issued a volume endorsing Freud's methods.)

When the unconscious mind has thus been explored by the psychoanalyst and the repressions and complexes fully revealed, the patient will be presented with a diagnosis of the unconscious trouble. With a knowledge of this concealed condition or with the revival of some past disturbing experience comes, Freud in-sists, the freedom from the phobia and the release from the burdensome worries, provided the complexes have not been too serious. In that case the psychoanalyst himself. The hideous climax has well been expressed in this plain English: "The Freudian psychoanalysts insist that to do a successful job the patient must fall in love with the physician, because by doing so, the patient overcomes all fixation on some unsuitable object.... The patient then becomes docile and tractable, eager to confess all." - It is to such depths that the new psychology has dropped!

#### SCIENTISTS SAY "NO" TO PSYCHOANALYSIS

We need not indulge in a lengthy, formal refutation. Nor will enthusiastic Freudians admit that there can be any refutation. Cornelia Parker, visiting one of Freud's "most brilliant young disciples in Vienna, a teacher and analyst," records a telltale incident in "The Capital of Psychology" (cited by McDougall, Outline of Abnormal Psychology, IX). Mrs. Parker, commenting on a recent book, declared: "It is hard to find a book where every word is beyond question. No man is God." In reply the Austrian mused: "No, of course; no man is God." Then, as she tells the story, he suddenly corrected himself and declared: "'Yes, yes, one man is God —Freud!' He pointed to his newly purchased set of Freud's writings in ten volumes. 'Every word in these ten volumes is absolutely correct. Freud is 100 per cent right. No, — 200 per cent. Every word Freud has written is absolutely correct. Every word he will write is absolutely correct.'"

Well-known psychologists, from the theoretical, conservative types to specialists in neurology, have not shown this fanaticism and have pointed out scientific defects and practical difficulties. Dr. Knight Dunlap, professor of experimental psychology in Johns Hopkins University, summarizes this aspect of the investigation in his Mysticism, Freudianism, and Scientific Psychology (page 92) : "Psychoanalysis is essentially antagonistic to scientific psychology and the scientific method in the mental sciences." The late Sir Clifford Allbutt gave this verdict: "Popular psychoanalysis is false science; it has no units, no means of measurements, no controls, no precise definitions, no separation of objective and subjective evi-dence." Dr. Charles W. Burr of the University of Pennsylvania declares: "Freudianism is based on assumptions.... The whole thing is absolutely unscientific. A large part of it is absolutely absurd. Incalculable harm, too, can be done by mental suggestion of this kind, and I have had young people come to me brokenhearted because, after reading Freud, they imagined they were abnormal, while as a matter of fact they were perfectly normal. Freudianism accepts much and proves nothing; yet it is the most popular psychology of today. It calls itself science, and science is the popular deity."

Passing the purely psychological and pathological facts for the contradiction of which Freud has been indicted, the reader will agree to the force of these two considerations:

First of all, psychoanalysis lays grossly exaggerated emphasis on sex. The financial depression has made the world a laboratory in which neurosis may be investigated and catalogued as never before. To ascribe these present-day nervous disorders to Freud's origin, sex, is to ignore the pervasive causation of worry, financial fear, fatigue, and frustrated hopes in a dozen directions as well as the conflict of environment. Dr. R. J. Berry, dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Melbourne, Australia, challenges: "Is it true that sex is the greatest driving force of life? Hunger is even greater, because it means the life of the individual, whereas a repressive sex does no one any harm." Freud makes man, from the first days of childhood to his last hours, a helpless tool of libido, with even his unconscious desires irresistibly focused on some sex complex or problem, as it ruthlessly crowds out pure emotions, presses its heel on the esthetic, swashbuckles through decency, and emerges on that animal plane in which man is just another lust-controlled creature.

Besides, the conclusions of Freudianism, overdrawn as they are, are based on a type of evidence which compromises their validity. It is essentially a psychology of the abnormal, and the study of its case work reveals a preponderance of neurotic subjects. Dr. Eduard Westermarck, whose investigation of marriage covers decades and who does not shrink from radical theorization, declares in his Critique of Freudianism: "For my own part I doubt whether the study of neurotic persons can be regarded as a safe guide to the proper understanding of normal manifestations." Myerson asserts: "The largest part of the theory is derived from the analysis of hysterics, who, as every clinician knows, lie very readily, are sug-gestible, and will take their cue from the physician in a mimetic way." ("Freud's Theory of Sex: A Criticism," in Calverton and Schmalhausen, o. c., p. 519.)

#### PSYCHOANALYSIS INDICTED ON THE COUNT OF IMMORALITY

Freudianism is also unmistakably pornographic. With an abandon it offers discussions which recall St. Jude's denunciation of "these filthy dreamers" who "defile the flesh" (verse 8). Dunlap remarks (o. c., p. 104): "It [psychoanalysis] is a part of the general problem of the circulation of pornographic literature, com-plicated, however, by the circumstances that a bolder front is put upon the salacious propaganda by the labels of 'psychology' or 'science.' "

Indeed, the procedures of psychoanalysis are often obscene. An impressionable mind that is saturated with its claims will receive a perverted outlook on life. We can understand why enraged parents in various sections of the country have risen up in the anger of formal protest; but we cannot understand why the trustees in many American schools have permitted this academic filth to flourish.

Our immigration authorities bar undesirable aliens on grounds of moral turpitude; yet treatises on psychoanalysis that revel in symbols, pictures, images, dreams, and the plainest proposals, all of which I do not dare mention even in veiled allusion, are thrust into the eager hands of psychology classes and avidly studied by thousands of young readers throughout the land.

Psychologists have also invoked wide-spread and justified criticism on their practices. They are not all wilful charlatans by any means; but that many have crossed the border-line of propriety and indulged in a sort of blackmail is admitted even by professional Freudians. The files of any modern newspaper will reveal homes broken and lives wrecked through the application of Freud's theories. Must not a system capable of provoking such extremes stand condemned by the forum of common decency?

Even greater is the destructive effect that psychoanalysis must exert upon immature minds, particularly when employed by inexperienced or unscrupulous analysts. To a person who believes in purity this wallowing in perversions must leave an unfortunate impress. Utterly remote suggestions are pushed into unholy prominence and cling with that clutching tenacity by which the sordid survives, while the good is buried and forgotten. In more serious cases mental derangement is inevitable.

Professional testimony to the force of these assertions comes in an arraignment of psychoanalysis by two French authorities, Hesnard and Perrin, whose opinions are summarized by René Sudre in the European (Paris): "Instead of healing, it [psychoanalysis ] really aggravates the ill — a malady of the mind that would have been helped by other, less inconsiderate treatments....

"A defective treatment may further trouble the debilitated. It may instil a sense of indignity sustained or fortify scruples in the minds of the obsessed.

"These views are shared by most psychiatrists. The psychoanalytical mode of treatment is not any more accepted as 'in-offensive.'

"One expert — a Freudian nevertheless — has recorded instances in which a sound and unsound diagnosis have had like disastrous results.

"To charge the mind of a perfectly moral character, for instance, with a theory that his difficulty is due to 'a ... complex' might drive him into a pernicious melancholia or even to suicide."

#### FREUDIANISM VS. CHRISTIANITY

Finally, psychoanalysis serves no necessary purpose in a life illumined by Christian consciousness. Psychologists who reject the theory assure us that the investigations which it provoked may shed new light on some of their problems. In its practical applica-tion, however, it stands opposed to Christ's teaching and to His emphasis on true morality. Whatever the influence of Freudianism may be, ultimately it offers nothing constructive to the Christian. He will have his problems, it is true; and he has no protection to keep him untouched by the onslaughts of temptation. He will often declare with the great apostle (Rom. 7:19 ff.): "The good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do... For I delight in the Law of God after the inward man; but I see another law in my members warring against the Law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" But he has a solution for his problems and a spiritual strengthening in temptation; he can continue with the apostle: "I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord." He has his God, the privilege to approach the throne of divine power and mercy in the name of Jesus Christ (see chapter 4); the strengthening power of the Sacrament (see chapter 5); the gift of an enlightened understanding of the purifying work of the Holy Spirit (see chapter 6); the power of prayer (see chapter 7) ; the friendly, consecrated counsel of spiritual advisers; and altogether an outlook on life which needs no psychoanalysis.

The deliberate appeal of the Church resolves itself into "Keep away from the psychoanalyst!" To cross the threshold of his office may be the first step to rob you of your peace of mind, disturb the delicate balance of your emotional life, and conjure up the endless procession of phantasmagoria which these ghouls-in-the-name-of-science have dug up from moldering graves.

Twenty-five years hence — and this is not prophecy, but a statement of antecedent probability based on the recurrent lessons of the past — psychoanalysis, as popularly understood and applied, will be buried in the cemetery of extinct conceits. The scientific student of the next generation, browsing around with antiquarian curiosity in these aisles of the ingloriously interred, may stumble over a tottering tombstone. Even in the presence of the dead he will not be able to suppress a smile when he brushes away cluttering weeds to read that on the inscription "Here lies the Theory of Freud" irreverent, but scientific iconoclasm has changed the e in the last word to a.

### CULTIC ZEALOTS OF IMPURITY

In the last days. . men shall be . . . without natural affection, ... incontinent, ... lovers of pleasures, ... having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. From such turn away. - 2 Tim. 3:1-5

It is one of the compelling axioms of history that the influence of Jesus Christ has been the only effective force in the attainment of the highest marriage standards. Unfortunately it is equally true that, wherever the clear-cut statements of Christ's faith have been questioned by religious cults, matrimonial ideals have suffered.

This helps to account for the fact that in this age of more than 300 religious isms (when newspaper advertisements feature columns of announcements publicizing exotic worship under such designations as The School of Silent Unity, Transcendent Science, The Ultimate Thought Society, The Church of Psychic Research, The Rosicrucian Philosophy, The School of Spiritual Science, The Philosophical Church of Natural Law), we have experienced a consistent deterioration of marital standards. Any one acquainted with contemporaneous religious life must view with the keenest amazement the noxious influences of mystic cults that have helped to spread the names of Gautama, Lao-tse, Confucius, the Bab, the Mahatmas, the Father-Mother God, Ishtar, Isis and Osiris, and other figures of pagan pantheons throughout the land like an epidemic. The Scriptural warning "A man's enemies are the men of his own house" (Micah 7:6) is strikingly applicable to our endless fabrication of cults, since some of the most vicious opponents of matrimony have come from the ranks of religion. How literally has St. Paul's warning to Timothy (2 Tim. 3:1-6) been fulfilled: "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. From such turn away. For of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts."

#### THE INSINUATIONS OF SWAMISM AND YOGISM

One of the more elaborate of these extravagances is found in the Hindu invasion of the United States, by which the pseudo-panacea of Yogism is spread throughout the nation. Fat swamis, quoting Yogoda and Einstein, frequent our cities to preach the "gospel" of cosmic vibration and to sing hymns of "eternal sym-phony" dedicated to Krishna, lord of Yogis, lord of love, and, according to the estimates of conservative Hindu mythology, the husband of 16,000 wives and the father of 180,000 children. From this background of Indian sensuality especial appeal is directed to American women. At a visit of a well-known swami to St. Louis five times as many women as men were present at a typical meeting in the Gold Room of Hotel Jefferson, one of the distinguished salons in that city. While dozens of these female students of Sankhya, Yoga, and Vedanta came apparently from the bluer sections of the St. Louis West End, the majority were middle-class women in the thirties and forties. They sat ready to receive advice in practical and domestic questions from an obese Hindu pseudo-prophet, who declared: "My words are the words of God."

A sinister aspect of Yogism is described in the American Social Hygiene Association's folder The Medical Charlatan. Under the title "Case No. 3" it calls attention to a Hindu Yogi who offered to treat disease by mail. Law-enforcing authorities, cooperating with the Hygiene Association, wrote a letter describing a medical case of disease with incomplete symptoms. The Yogi diagnosed the symptoms (purposely described so vaguely that diagnosis would be impossible) as a serious venereal disease. The writer of the letter was advised "not to consult a local doctor, as he would be reported to the health department and taken to the county hospital, where three to five years of treatment would be required. A cure by this 'quack' was guaranteed in six or eight weeks at a cost of ten dollars a week."

Much more dangerous because of its wider web and stronger meshes is the closely related theosophy founded more than fifty years ago by a Russian adventuress, Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, "one of the most accomplished, ingenious, and interesting charlatans" (C. E. Bechhover Roberts, The Mysterious Madame). At the age of seventeen she married the "ugly, old General Blavatsky" but deserted him after less than three months and during a twenty-five years' globe-trotting left an international trail of scandal. First she eloped to Constantinople with a sea captain; then followed successive affairs with an opera singer, an episode with a baron, a marriage in New York while previous husbands still lived, an illicit union with a Philadelphia merchant, and other similar experiences.

Ordinarily the moral and religious theories of a woman with her past would command no serious attention, but by that strange perversion which, rejecting the exposition of divine truth, accepts fraud, her weird combination of voodooism, astrology, Indian occultism, karma, Nirvana, and cabalistic eccentricities of all kinds, this religious hodgepodge was accepted, we are told, by 100,000 people at the time of her death. During her quarter-century wandering she claimed to have pushed through the almost impenetrable barriers of Tibet, contacting the Mahatmas, "the elder brothers of the human race," and learning from them the esoteric secrets of this occult brotherhood. These "revelations" were codified into a religious system, which excludes Christ, ridicules the Bible, and poisons all Christian hope. In addition to taxing the credulity even of semiintelligence she tells in detail how the Mahatmas paraded their astral bodies before her and by some spiritist form of radio called precipitation sent her personal messages from Tibet to America in the fraction of a split second. Exposure was inevitable. The Psychical Research Society pronounced the verdict of fraud.

No scientific body is required to pronounce upon her teachings in regard to marriage and morality, which feature the usual cultic debauch. In Madame Blavatsky's The Key to Theosophy (p. 207 f.) we read this catechetical dialog:

"Enquirer: "Must a man marry or remain a celibate [in accepting theosophy]?'

"Theosophist: "There is no reason why he should not marry if he likes to take the risks of that lottery where there are so many more blanks than prizes.'

"Enquirer: 'But why cannot one acquire this knowledge and power when living a married life?'

"Theosophist: 'Can a man serve two masters? No. Then it is equally impossible for him to divide his attention between the pursuit of occultism and a wife.'"

Theosophy emphasizes the high-sounding doctrines of soul mar-riage; yet theosophists are told that legal and conventional marriages must be cast aside when affinity meets affinity, that lawful companions must be deserted when the male and female principles of the spirit world are thrown together in soul unions. Mercine Elan Sloan, investigator of theosophy, says: "I have seen clandestine love-letters sent by a writer of theosophic books to a woman theoso-phist, with whom he was working the affinity proposition, that contained matter of such a character that the postal authorities took the case in hand to suppress the correspondence. The woman protested innocence of intention, claiming it to be only a test of her spiritual development. But that man was connected with a Chicago outfit of deceivers who worked the 'Great School' secret order for the express purpose of ensnaring women.... By gradual instruction and influence, members are led to the point of believing that promiscuous sexuality is proper if only it be an expression of spiritual affinity. Our public libraries contain books, of which the general public has no knowledge, that are eagerly read by women under theosophic tutelage. Librarians say that they get books in response to demands from patrons, but do not know the nature of the contents. A few years ago the librarian in the city of Washington had me analyze for him some such books; for he had not time for it nor the information by which to judge. Such books should be destroyed; for their pernicious influence is corrupting many." (Modern Theosophy, p. 70.)

Indeed, what good can be expected from a creed in which Madame Blavatsky lays down the following blasphemous definition of marriage: "Matrimony is ... a monstrous repetitive existence, wherein its adherents are gently held by the soporific anesthesia of public opinion, that deadly effluvia by which the majority of mortals are slowly, but surely led to ruin and dismay, where their individual advancement is held in check, genius abrogated and destroyed, and development arrested, except after those lines which are in accord with this terrible monster."

Can any benefit come from a system in which Madame Blavatsky confides to her initiates: "I carefully prepared those whom I could trust so that they would not drift back into the worldly methods. I sought in this way to impart magnetic and sexual truths which could be imparted from ear to ear"? Are these sentiments of a college president's wife expressive of higher home ideals: "My husband and children are no more to me than any others equally deserving regard. My religion [theosophy] teaches me that they have no claim on me, and I am free to seek the perfect life alone"? (Sloan, ibid., 51.) Is the hope of a purer, more helpful attitude toward marriage to be derived from the teachings of Madame Blavatsky's successor, Mrs. Annie Besant, who left her husband after seven years of married life, joined the Freethinkers' Society as an energetic atheist, and then was arrested with Charles Brad-laugh, atheist, for distributing birth-control literature? Is there any ray of hope in the teachings of Catherine Tingley, the megalomaniac theosophist, who claimed to be the incarnation of Blavatsky and who did not shrink from asserting that she was the greatest teacher of all ages, not excluding Christ?

#### SPIRITISM'S DEBAUCH

Two other women who played notorious roles as founders of religious perversion are the Fox sisters, American originators of spiritism. In some circles they are still held in such marked admiration that the hamlet in which they were born, Hydesville, New York, is regarded as destined to greater distinction than Bethlehem. This at least was the claim of the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; and the mysterious rappings in their home which hurled the Foxes into international prominence are doubtless more familiar to thousands of their followers than the details of the Christmas Evangel.

Well known is the fraud and deceit practiced by spiritist mediums. Recently the American Society for Psychic Research assigned to Dr. H. C. McComas the task of investigating the methods of professional spiritists. He recorded that if, when visiting a medium, he discarded "sympathy and imagination, her statements about me became a sort of crazy-quilt of irrelevant remarks." He admitted that men with scientific training are "about the poorest in the matter of debunking séance frauds." And he stated, "It is necessary for the séance chamber to be filled with vigorous vibrations in order to prime the supposed power. This results in loud and awful singing and enables the medium to do various things without your hearing them."

Even more significant is the statement of Rose Mackenberg, who for thirteen years has investigated spiritist meetings and has more than 1,500 exposures of fraud to her credit. She is employed by banks, chambers of commerce, and civic groups who ask her assistance when they believe that clients or communities are being duped by the pretense of psychic powers. In discussing her varied experiences, she declared: "I never married, but I received messages from 1,000 husbands and twice as many children in the world to come. Invariably they told me that they were happy where they were, which was not entirely flattering to me. During the course of my investigation I have visited mediums all over the country; but whether they lived in luxurious hotels or fire-trap tenements, their messages were all of the same caliber. I have even been ordained six times as a spiritualistic minister. These ordinations took anywhere from twenty-three minutes to three days and cost me from $5 to $25. In order further to test the psychic powers claimed by the presiding mediums, I took such ridiculous names as Allicia Bunck (all is a bunk) and F. Raud, easily read as 'fraud'; but I was not suspected. My money was accepted, I was presented with a nicely engraved certificate of ordination, and became a supposedly full-fledged seer, ready to communicate with departed spirits at so much per communication."

Not so well known, however, is the immorality that spreads beneath the surface of this cult and the domestic tragedies to which the Endor road leads. Besides denying every fundamental truth of the Scriptures, spiritism has loaded upon itself the vice of ridiculing marriage. In spite of its "higher" interpretation of mar-riage, neither its personnel nor its results have ever inspired confidence. Margaret Fox lived her last years in drunken destitution. Those who have followed her often display so much deceit and lechery that they must immediately be disqualified as mentors of morality. Some of the mediums have been infamous. In his oft-quoted work on spiritism Baron von Schrenk-Notzing reproduces about 150 photographs featuring Eva C., his favorite medium. Yet the Baron himself concedes her notorious, immoral character. Ann O'Delia Diss Debar, whose name stands "among the half-score or more in the front ranks of the history of spiritualism" and who handled financial deals involving hundreds of thousands of dollars, has been classed as among "the ten most prominent and dangerous female criminals of the world." "Her repertoire is claimed to have run the full gamut from petty confidence games to elaborately contrived schemes aimed at the magnates of Wall Street." (Houdini: A Magician among the Spirits, p. 66 f.) She was found guilty of various crimes in New York, Geneva, and New Orleans, and was finally sentenced to seven years' penal servitude in London for "aiding and abetting the commission of rape." The fles of an unmuzzled newspaper will reveal in its record of mediumistic activity many parallels of spiritist crime.

The tragedies resulting from the counsel of this necromantic immorality may be anticipated. Here is a young Barnard College student who, insisting that she was in love with a spirit, was finally driven to suicide; a Washington, D.C., husband was granted a divorce because his wife confessed that she had a "spirit affinity by the name of Alfred"; a San Francisco father shot and killed two of his sons, maintaining that communications from his dead wife had begged him to send all five children to her. Here is the record of a bridegroom's being married to a spirit bride; a St. Louis husband who complains to the court because of the indiscretions into which spiritism led his wife; a woman minister of a fashionable Los Angeles church patiently awaiting a message from the soul of a realty broker who committed suicide after promising that he would communicate with her as soon as he reached "the other world"; a Milwaukee husband who told the court that his wife, a devotee of spiritism, neglected her home to attend séances, where she would hug and kiss the materialized spirit of her first husband; a Newark mother who swallowed poison after slaying her baby son in the belief that as an emancipated spirit she could guide her husband to a spiritist heaven and happiness. Here, as a climax, is the confession of Margaret Fox, in which she admits that under the badge of spiritualism immorality stalks unchecked. "Do you know," she asks, "that there is something behind the shadowy mask of spiritualism that the public can hardly guess at? I am stating now what I know, not because I actually participated in it, — for I would never be a party to such promiscuous nastiness, — but because I had plenty of opportunity, as you may imagine, of verifying it. Under the name of this dreadful, this horrible, hypocrisy - spiritualism - everything that is improper, bad, and immoral is practiced. They go even so far as to have what they call 'spiritual children.' They pretend to something like the immaculate conception. Could anything be more blas-phemous, more disgusting, more thinly deceptive than that? In London I went in disguise to a quiet séance at the house of a wealthy man, and I saw a so-called materialization. The effect was produced by the aid of luminous paper, the luster of which was reflected upon the operator. The figure thus displayed was that of a woman virtually nude, being enveloped in transparent gauze, the face alone being concealed. This was one of those séances to which the privileged non-believing friends of believing spiritualists could have access. But there are other séances, where none but the most tried and trusted are admitted and where there are shameless goings-on that vie with the secret Saturnalia of the Romans. I could not describe these things tó you because I would not."

This consultation of spirits, then, stands condemned by its own procedure. The wonder of it all is that in our scientific age and in a country where popular government is instituted to guard and promote the well-being and prosperity of the citizens, there are still communities in which the spiritist mediums can flaunt the invitation to their séances before the public eye. To ban these modern con-sulters of familiar spirits, home-wreckers that they are, from the length and breadth of the land would be a public service of monumental proportions.

#### THE CONTRAVENTION OF CHRISTIAN SCIENCE

In Christian Science the disparagement of marriage is also unmistakable. Mrs. Eddy was embittered against matrimony through her own marital experiences. Her first husband, George W. Glover, died soon after their marriage. Her second husband, Dr. Daniel Patterson, deserted her. And her third husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, to whom she was married at the age of fifty-six (although her age was given as forty on the marriage license), was completely dominated by her personality. This disillusionment has expressed itself in an unmistakable rancor. Marriage is assailed as carnal. Obedient followers are reminded that Jesus was not restricted by family ties and that the Scriptures prohibit us from calling any man "Father." Mrs. Eddy wrote in all seriousness: "To abolish marriage at this period and maintain morality and generation would put ingenuity to ludicrous shifts; yet this is possible in Science although it is today problematic." (Miscellaneous Writings, p. 286.) Her answer to the question "What do you think of marriage?" is cynical: "It is often convenient, sometimes pleasant, and occasionally a love affair." (Ibid., 52.) In her earlier and bolder teachings Mrs. Eddy did not shrink from asserting that the truly spiritual state could be obtained only by abstinence from marriage. In Science and Health and other writings these socially dangerous statements were toned down; but in related utterances (some of which were biological absurdities, omitted in subsequent editions) an undeniable apathy toward marriage is inculcated by such statements as the following:

"Is marriage nearer right than celibacy? Human knowledge inculcates that it is, but Christian Science indicates that it is not." (Ibid., 288.)

"Human nature has bestowed on a wife the right to become a mother; but if the wife esteems not this privilege, ... she may win a higher." (Ibid., 289.)

And when the "Mother Church" in Boston was dedicated, Mrs. Eddy's biting derision rose to such scorn that she declared marriage to be synonymous with legalized lust. (Christian Science Journal, July, 1906.)

This endorsement of practical celibacy led some of "Mother" Eddy's most devoted pupils astray. Mrs. Josephine Curtis Wood-bury, who tried to apply Mrs. Eddy's preachments, startled the world in 1890 by claiming a virgin birth for her son, "The Prince of Peace." Mrs. Eddy had not been consulted about this miracle, and her reaction was one of almost unrestrained fury. Mrs. Woodbury was excommunicated. Taking up her defense in the Arena (May, 1899), she insisted that Mrs. Eddy had taught that "women may become mothers through a supreme effort of their own minds or through the influence on them of an unholy ghost, a malign spirit." Developing the influence of this demoniacal element, Mrs. Woodbury charged: "Women of unquestioned integrity who have been Mrs. Eddy's students testify that she has so taught and that by this teaching families have been broken up, that thus maidens have been terrified out of their wits... Whatever her denials may be, such was Mrs. Eddy's teaching while in her college; to which she added the oracular declaration that it lay within her power to dissolve such motherhood by a wave of her celestial rod. The selfish celibacy of nuns and clergy, Christian or heathen, with consequent ecclesiastical interference in family life have been and are mischief-breeding blunders, fatal alike to morals and health." One of Mrs. Mary Baker Glover-Patterson-Eddy's most-beloved pupils was Mrs. Augusta Stetson, who likewise endeavored to follow the matrimonial teachings of "the Leader." In the minutes of Mrs. Stetson's Christian Science Institute we find reports of several of her addresses which describe marriage as unclean and carnal, directly opposed to the ethical and spiritual life. She emphasized absolute virginity — "that pure virginity which is at once the heritage and the prime requirement of the sons and daughters of God." Swihart in Since Mrs. Eddy (pp. 110-113) brings this summary of her attitude toward marriage: "Among the students who received these advance doctrines a few rebelled, but a great number endorsed them. Some families were greatly stirred, especially when not all of the members were Christian Scientists. With her practitioners Mrs. Stetson was much more rigid than with her church-members. Of the former she demanded absolute chastity. One day her secretary told her that a man who had been one of her chief assistants in building the church had married. Mrs. Stet-son, with eyes flashing, exclaimed: "What? Has he forsaken me?' The secretary explained that he had not left her; at least he had not yet begotten any progeny. Then Mrs. Stetson exclaimed: 'What did I ever get martied for?' Her secretary replied: "Well, Teacher, you didn't know any better; did you?' Mrs. Stetson then admitted: 'I was a fool; wasn't I?' "

It may well be anticipated that these teachings created a furore. They provoked the following editorial in the New York World: "Couples intending to marry have asked Mrs. Stetson's approval and, not receiving it, have abandoned the idea. Wives have been taught that a more spiritual existence would be the life of a nun, and as far as possible, some of them have tried to live like nuns. All family relations are regarded by the initiated in Mrs. Stetson's church as errors, save only the relation of brother and sister. Childbirth is the result of sin in any wife, and no practitioner is allowed to help any woman at such a time, even though she die. Husbands and wives having no children, but desiring them, are not to be aided to thus 'perpetuate the error of belief in birth and death,' and the relation of parent to child, it is taught, should be that of brother and sister only. Of course, the people who are 'not ready are not told these things, but they are taught to most students who pay their hundred dollars for the advanced instruction."

The accepted Eddyism of our day has of course not seriously endeavored to maintain its founder's antagonism to marriage. But the pronouncements of "the infallible Mother" still stand. The marriage ceremony has never once been performed in any of the hundreds of pretentious temples of Eddyism that dot the élite sections of our large cities; for Christian Science has neither a marriage ritual nor any officials authorized to perform the ceremony. Its effects may be seen both in the generally disdainful attitude which the practitioners assume toward marriage and in the many childless families of its adherents. Frederick W. Peabody (The Religio-Medical Masquerade, p. 164) points out that the effect of Mrs. Eddy's antimarriage bias "is shown in the difference between Christian Science Sunday-schools and Christian Sunday-schools. The membership of Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian Sunday-schools is about the same as their church-membership; while in Christian Science Sunday-schools there is but one child for every five church-members." Together with its broad perversions involving God, the Scriptures, sin, redemption, eternity, and every fundamental Christian doctrine, the belittling of marriage and the denial of the divine wisdom by which it was instituted must be rejected by every Christian who loves the truth of God.

#### THE MENACE OF MORMONISM

Mormonism comes under similar indictment, particularly because of its endorsement of polygamy. This practice is based on a somewhat complicated doctrinal foundation. The supreme ruler in this polytheistic system is "our father Adam," the paragon of spirituality. Others who partake of this divinity are Christ, Mo-hammed, Joseph Smith, and Brigham Young. "Each god through his wife or wives raises up a numerous family of sons and daughters, ... for each father and mother will be in a condition to multiply forever and ever." (The Seer, I, 37.) These deities create the souls for the physical bodies on earth. When the faithful Mormon dies, he, too, becomes a god, and his honor is enhanced by a large number of children. This article of the Mormon creed authorizes polygamy; for the myriads of spirits which are awaiting incarnation must have bodies. Though there are apparently two conflicting statements in The Book of Mormon, the sense of its much-disputed passage in Jacob 2:6 is that, when God has not commanded polygamy and it is practiced for mere sensual gratification, it is an abomination; but when God has commanded polygamy — as He did to the Mormons — so that seed may be raised up to Him, it is a duty.

In harmony with these teachings the "saints" certainly recognized plural wifery as a sacred obligation and produced immense families. Joseph Smith, of epileptic ancestry, graduated from peepstones and crystal balls to mystic disclosures by the angel Moroni, boasted in prophecy: "One hundred years won't pass away before my posterity will outnumber the present inhabitants of the State of New York." He was the author of The Revelation of Celestial Marriage, written through the aid of an amanuensis because Smith was illiterate. This "revelation" he "received" in 1843. Nine years later it was embodied in the official creed of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants (sec. 132): "And again, as pertaining to the law of priesthood: if a man espouse a virgin and desire to espouse another, ... he may have ten virgins given unto him by this law; he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him; therefore he is justified" (p. 473). Joseph Smith's personal polygamy, before he was assassinated by a mob at Carthage, Illinois, has been demonstrated beyond all question. (Cf. the affidavits in Charles A. Shook, The True Origin of Mormon Polygamy.) Brigham Young, his successor, was survived by twenty-five wives and fifty-six children. In 1873 he had been sued for divorce by Anna Eliza Yeung, Wife No. 19, as she was called. At various times it was necessary to imprison and fine this Mormon "saint" for failure to pay alimony.

As every contradiction of divine ordinances, polygamy promotes domestic strife and raises deep-rooted problems. A crisis arose in early Mormon history which called for these sermonic remarks by Brigham Young on September 21, 1856 (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 4, pp. 55, 57): "Men will say, 'My wife, though an excellent woman, has not seen a happy day for a year,' says one: and another has not seen a happy day for five years. - I am going to give you from this time to the sixth day of October next for reflection that you may determine whether you wish to stay with your husbands or not, and then I am going to set every woman at liberty and say to them, Now go your way, my women, with the rest, go your way? And my wives have got to do one of two things; either round off their shoulders to endure the afflictions of this world and live their religion, or they may leave, for I will not have them about me. I will go into heaven alone rather than have them scratching and fighting around me. - Prepare yourselves for two weeks from tomorrow; and I will tell you now that, if you tarry with your husbands after I have set you free, you must bow down to it and submit yourselves to the celestial law. You may go where you please after two weeks from tomorrow; but remember that I will not hear any more of this whining."

This permission to "go where you please" sounds generous. But where could the desert-bound women find refuge? Walda R. Schumann, who has spoken with some of the early settlers in Utah and recorded the otherwise suppressed feelings of the women, writes (Walther League Messenger, November, 1935, p. 146 ff.): "Many Mormon women were able to put up with polygamy in a matter-of-fact, come-what-may, philosophical sort of way. Take, for instance, the wife who was informed by her husband that he had made arrangements to marry a second wife, a young girl of her acquaintance, on the following day. Objections were useless, so she might as well acquiesce and keep her husband in a good humor toward herself by putting up a picnic lunch, which she set into the buggy, for her husband and his new bride to enjoy after the wedding ceremony. In fact, she even helped the girl dress for the occasion that she might look her prettiest. Most of the women, however, experienced much heartache, jealousy, and untold misery, some even losing their minds under the terrible strain. What would have been your reaction, do you suppose, had you been in the place of the young wife and mother who passionately loved her husband and could hardly await the day that he returned from two years of mission-work in England only to find that he had brought back with himself another wife? And with this younger woman the heart-broken wife had to share everything."

Despite the hardships which plural marriages brought upon the Mormon wives and mothers, woe to the unfaithful wife! There was one atonement for the sin of adultery: expiation by blood! Militant Brigham Young declares: "I know, when you hear my brethren telling about cutting people off from the earth, that you consider it a strong doctrine; but it is to save them, not to destroy them." (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 4, pp. 53, 54.) In his biography of Young, M. R. Werner draws this gruesome picture of the doctrine of blood atonement in operation: "One of the wives of a Mormon in Salt Lake City was unfaithful to him while he was on a mission in foreign lands. When he returned, the Church was in the throes of the [Mormon] reformation, and his wife believed that she was doomed to lose the right to those children she had borne her husband in lawful wedlock and that she would be separated from him and from them in eternity. She told her husband of her fears and of her sin, and he agreed with her that the fears were justified and the sin awful. She sat on her husband's knee and embraced him as she had never done before, while, as he returned her kisses, he cut her throat and thereby sent her spirit to the gods in all its former purity." (P. 404 f. Cf. T. B. H. Sten-house, The Rocky Mountain Saints, pp. 469, 470.)

These practices soon brought the polygamous Mormons into conflict with their fellow-countrymen. In 1882 the Edmunds Act was passed, disenfranchising all who lived in polygamous relations. It has been estimated that about 12,000 names of men and women were removed from the registration lists. In 1890 Wilford Wood-ruff, president of the Mormons, issued his celebrated manifesto, concluding with the lukewarm statement: "I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land." It would be difficult to prove that this statement is anything more than advice. For many years his counsel was ignored. Thus, Joseph F. Smith, nephew of the founder of the cult, married to five wives, succeeded to the presidency in 1901. In March, 1907, soon after the birth of his forty-third child, he was found guilty of breaking the law against polygamy and was fined $300.

The statute has not been able to wipe out polygamy. It still flourishes in the Mormon hinterland. On March 15, 1935, the Hon. Lyle B. Nicholas told the Utah House of Representatives, then in session: "I assure you that there is a deplorable condition existing, particularly in Salt Lake County. Polygamy is being practiced, and many plural wives and their children are on the relief rolls." As a consequence of these conditions a bill was passed by the Utah Legislature making polygamy a felony instead of a mis-demeanor. When a more strictly enforced law in Arizona summoned John Y. Barlow for jury trial on the charge of polygamy, he declared: "We are believers in the true, first Mormonism. We are directed to enter a new covenant of marriage, meaning the acceptance of a plurality of wives and the propagation of families, in the doctrines of the Church. It is a God-given law, and we believe the power and the glory of the spirit in the hereafter depends upon the obedience of man to the law of God." (Associated Press Dispatch, October 14, 1935.) Investigators found that eighteen of the nineteen children at the Lee's Ferry (Arizona) school were the offspring of one of Barlow's associates and followers:

This much is certain: Mormonism has never openly condemned polygamy. Presiding Bishop Nibley perhaps gave expression to the prevalent Mormon attitude on this question when, writing in Era, the Mormon young people's magazine with reference to the twoscore and three children of multi-married Joseph F. Smith, he asked: "Is not this ... about the most God-pleasing piece of work that man can do, ... the work of a god in embryo? The whole church can take pride in the vindication of a great principle which he has so successfully wrought out." In Articles of Faith (14th English edition, 1925, p. 425), by James E. Talmage, "one of the twelve apostles of the church," the intervention of the Government in prohibiting plural marriage is cited as "a suspension of divine law" and the responsibility is solemnly placed on the nation.

Mormonism finds some solace for the prohibition of polygamy in the doctrine of celestial marriage, permitted those members of the church who are judged worthy of participation in this special blessing. Their marriage is supplemented by the ecclesiastical "sealing," in which allegedly the union is made indissoluble "for time and for all eternity." Men may be sealed to an unlimited number of women, while a double "celestial" standard in Mormon theology prohibits a woman from being sealed to more than one man. Indeed, Mormon women are told they are saved through their husbands. Proxy marriages and sealed marriages are adopted for the particular benefit of the women who died unsealed. By these teachings Mormonism, despising the plain implications of Biblical truth (Matt. 22:20) and its exalted emphasis on marriage, compensates for the polygamy ruled out by an unsympathetic Supreme Court and creates a polygamous heaven.

#### SWEDENBORGIANISM INDICTED

Similarly startling in its departure from the Biblical sanctity of matrimony are the heresies of Baron Emanuel Swedenborg (1688—1772). In the realm of science Swedenborg possessed that extraordinary genius which anticipates discoveries and inventions by centuries. Long before Laplace advanced his nebular hypothesis, this son of a theological professor at Upsala had formulated the identical theory, faulty as modern investigation has shown it to be. A century and a half before any other physiologist he demonstrated that the motion of the brain synchronizes with respiration and not with the circulation of the blood. It is claimed that his theories in regard to the functions of the spinal cord and the ductless glands harmonize with recent investigation. He was a pioneer in paleon-tology, an expert in metallurgy, a mathematician of such renown that he was offered the chair in this science at the University of Upsala, and a parliamentarian who dealt with such strikingly modern topics as currency, balance of trade, liquor laws. He was far ahead of his time in his theories on light and cosmic atoms, as well as in a half-dozen more complicated scientific hypotheses. He invented an ear-trumpet for the deaf, eliminated smoky chim-neys, improved defective stoves, and even sketched an airplane which in some respects is a prototype of our monoplane.

How constructive his career would have been if he had restricted the researches of his prodigious mind to science! Instead, after reaching middle age, he substituted psychic and spiritual investigation for these concrete studies. Here the debacle started. The heavens were opened to him, he claimed, by the personal manifestation of the Lord. He insisted that he was called by the Lord God "to unfold the spiritual signs of the Holy Scriptures." What he unfolded was anything but spiritual and Scriptural. He denies the inspiration of thirty-two of the sixty-six books of the Bible, brands its literal sense as unholy, and by his allegorical interpretation reduces it to absurdity. He misinterprets the Trinity, overrules the omnipotence of God, contradicts the Christian doctrine of redemption, rejects the verities of the Resurrection, and denies other basic teachings of Scripture.

Parallel in the depths of its descent from revealed truth is his speculation regarding marriage, with which his acquaintance, unlike that in his scientific researches, was wholly theoretical. Swedenborg was a bachelor. The translation of one of his voluminous treatises has been labeled "one of the most obscene and impure books in the English language.... Many parts of it, like the perversions practiced in the worship of Hindu idols, are too impure to be presented to the reader's eye."

However strenuously Swedenborg's followers today may squirm under this indictment of their patron's creed; however insistently they may try to spiritualize or condone, the absolute fact remains that not once, but repeatedly Emanuel Swedenborg taught that those who for various causes cannot enter marriage should nevertheless be permitted to enjoy its intimacies.

I cannot print on these pages the exact words in which this debauch is set forth by Swedenborg. Nor will I mention the sanction that his writings offer to procedures too delicate to be recorded. Suffice it to say that doctrines of plurality of wives, easy divorce, "mild adulteries," lasciviousness, a sensual Mohammedan heaven, are the least of these glaring errors. One cannot but wonder, reading the excrescences of this man, who on his death-bed requested Communion, how his followers in the Church of the New Jerusalem can attempt to spiritualize these gross immoralities.

#### ANTIMARRIAGE CULTS

Another woman destined to become the founder of an anti-marriage sect was Ann Lee. Her own married life was tragic. Her four children died in rapid succession, and her husband later deserted her. Long before this separation she had allegedly received revelations against marriage and had been arrested for preaching that wedded life was merely carnal and should be disavowed in preparation for Christ's second coming. While imprisoned in Manchester, England, she spoke to four examining clergymen in seventy-two different languages — at least according to her own story — and received another vision telling her that she was a second incarnation of Christ and the head of all women as Christ was the head of all men. As the father spirit was manifested through Jesus, so the mother spirit was to be manifested through her. She emigrated to America in 1774 to promote the spread of her church, called "the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming" or designated by unsympathetic observers as "the Shaking Quakers" or "the Shakers," because of the gyrations and contortions in which she and her followers often indulged under the ecstasy of religious excitement.

Rejecting the deity of Christ and the authority of the Scriptures, "Mother Lee" and her followers stressed virginal purity and insisted that there was to be no marriage or giving in marriage. The Shakers claim that the greatest cause of moral debasement is matrimony; their followers live apart in communal settlements, men and women segregated and guarded by untiring vigilance. This suicidal doctrine has of course brought them perilously close to the edge of extinction. Their rapid decline may be shown by the fact that, according to government census, in 1916 there were twelve Shaker churches, with 367 members, while ten years later, in 1926, these figures had been cut in half, only six Shaker churches, with 192 members, remaining. On several occasions I visited their now extinct colony at Lebanon, New Hampshire, and spoke with the patriarchal inmates. I have never been able to leave without the lasting impression that this dying remnant tragically symbolizes the folly of nullifying the matrimonial institutions of God.

Similarly ascetic is the House of David at Benton Harbor. Michigan, perhaps best known to the readers because of its long bearded baseball team and the sordid trial of Benjamin Purnell, who claimed to be the seventh and consuming messenger prophesied in Rev. 10:7. Declaring that the birth of children is sinful and therefore to be avoided, that marriage must be purely spiritual, Purnell, under the guise of a higher religion, deliberately contradicted his theories and was banished from his own colony because of immorality. Another one of the self-incriminations with which the salesmen of celibacy have burdened themselves!

Thus this procession of counterfeits of Christianity marches on, with leaders like "Judge" Rutherford of "millions-now-living-will-never-die" fame (whose wife was finally granted a divorce after five years of scandal) ; with representatives of the type of Mrs. Semple-McPherson-Hutton, whose multiple matrimonial careers and divorces are common knowledge. All these, parading in the name of religion and under the guise of special revelation, by example or direct precept, have torn God's sacred gift of holy matrimony from its Scriptural shrine. They have loaded themselves down with the millstones of offense while posing as liberating teachers of humanity.

### MODERNISM, THE DOGMA OF DECADENCE

They profess that they know God, but in works they deny Him - Titus 1:16

It is not accidental that the greatest breakdown of marriage morals occurs at the moment of America's most pronounced religious Liberalism, after a half century of increasingly heavy poundings against the bulwarks of conservative Christianity. In Israel harlotry flourished when priests and people turned their backs upon the worship of Jehovah; and in all ages since, wherever infidelity has usurped control of high places in the churches' administration, a moral drop has quickly followed. The triumph of rationalism in Germany during the eighteenth century "Enlightenment" corresponded to a collapse of chastity. During this period, when skepticism sat on exalted thrones, the six newspapers of Hamburg constantly lampooned piety, championed paganism, glorified suicide, and stuffed their columns with ribald humor and indecent narrative. A German commentator reviewing that age of unbelief summarizes: "Perhaps never since there was an evangelical Church was the ... moral life so low. Never such looseness in morals, never so widely current a spirit of despair."

This connection between Modernism and morals is a truism of history and is conceded even by the Liberals themselves. Glenn Frank points out that the consequences of religious Liberalism are felt most strongly a generation or two after the first flourish of infidelity. In a syndicated article entitled "Theology and Morals" he writes these pointed sentences: "I want to indicate the way in which what the theologians did a half century ago is today affecting the morals and manners of the current generation. There took place in the latter half of the nineteenth century a fairly general emancipation from the traditional orthodoxy, ... but for the generation which effected this emancipation it remained an intellectual emancipation only. ... If those pioneers in theological reconstruction could return to watch their descendants, . .. they might be surprised, if not shocked, by the harvest that has sprung from the seeds of nineteenth-century dissent. ... In fields as intimately related as religion and morals it is impossible to release the forces of free and independent judgment in one and isolate the other from their impact."

If, as this analysis intimates, the last generation ate the grapes that have set modern teeth on edge, what devastation awaits us tomorrow, when present-day unbelief gathers its full momentum?

#### BUCCANEER TACTICS

The unbelief of the hour, parading under the cloak of "modern Christianity," constitutes the most wide-spread anti-Scriptural movement in which American Protestantism has ever participated. Pirate pulpiteers have boarded the ship of the Church and attempted to throw overboard the doctrines through which the Church has hitherto pointed to the happiness of a God-pleasing marriage.

No corsairs of the Barbary Coast have ever sailed the seas more confidently than our clerical. Captain Kidds. Modernism has undisputed sway over Protestant radio interests. National broadcasting systems generously allocate time for several weekly programs to liberal Protestantism but refuse to permit a preacher of the full Gospel to broadcast the message of Christ over their facilities even though he pay the full charges. Beer and cigaret advertisements, lip-rouge merchants, loan companies, all have been welcomed to the ether; but through modernist influence the conservative forces of Christianity are often ruled off the air or obliged to content themselves with paying a high price.

Liberalism has gained a parallel influence over the press. The statements of an unswerving preacher of the Gospel usually bring little that our newspapers are eager to print, while Liberalists, entirely destitute of any compulsion to preach the Law and Gospel, may indulge in ear-tickling sensations or sophisticated wise-cracks and usurp the lion's share of the newspapers' columns. In this way the unthinking masses are led to regard the voice of Liberalism as the utterance of the Christian Church.

Christian institutions founded for the perpetuation of the Savior's doctrines have been seized by the machinations of Modernism. In 1885 Daniel Sharpe Ford, Boston publisher, left more than one third of a million dollars for the erection of an institution which was to help men "to accept Christ and Christ's teachings as the guides of their life." This fund was devoted to the establishment of the well-known Ford Hall Forum. But the men who are featured on its program, far from promoting the interests of Christ's kingdom, have sometimes shown notoriously atheistic tendencies. The speaker who has been heard most frequently in this forum wrote among other things: "I do not know when my redeemer will live or whose redeemer I may be, except in the sense that every man is his own redeemer." The second most popular speaker in the Ford Hall Forum characteristically attacks Christianity in statements like these: "The doctrines ... which make up the content of Christian tradition are simply not true. They have been refuted a thousand times. They are ignored in our schools and colleges and laughed at in our newspapers... The Church is disloyal to truth; she is engaged in the business of falsehood and deceit." (From Ernest Gordon: The Leaven of the Sadducees, p. 259.)

The complete triumph of Modernism in our country, however, has been its usurpation of control over the large Protestant churches, particularly through the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America. Theoretically dedicated to the spreading of the Savior's Gospel, the policies and pronouncements of this organization, which claims to be the voice of Protestant Christianity in our country, have steadily assumed a negative attitude, with increasing concessions to Modernism. Representing a membership of 22,000,000 Protestants, although large churches like the Syndical Conference of the Lutheran Church refusing participation, this federation has passed under liberal control. Its revolt against Scriptural standards, as will be shown, is conspicuous in its attitude on marriage.

#### THE LIBERAL CLERGY ON MARRIAGE

It must be said to the shame of our day, just as in classical antiquity pagan priests were leaders in the violation of family ethics, so today some of the most obnoxious protests against the divinely sanctified order emanate from liberal preachers.

A pastor of a Brooklyn, New York, Unitarian church told his congregation: "From my experience as a minister I know that marriage is not feasible for the average person today. The basic possibility... of a man or woman living together over any considerable period of time and retaining their respect for each other is at best precarious." He added that both he and his wife had retained their independence and continued their premarriage friendships with members of the opposite sex.

A preacher of a Madison, Wisconsin, students' chapel asserted: "There is a double standard. Freedom for unmarried men is accepted... Sex morals are changing and will change... Divorce is a bit of the new morality sanctioned by religion. So is birth control a bit of the new morality. I have heard no Protestant Church say anything against this practice. Having a large family used to be considered a virtue; now it is regarded with suspicion." A New York Episcopal rector declared to a newspaper reporter: "Orthodox theology means nothing to civilized people. Sociology is more important than religious doctrine. I base my religion on these statements: For example, before I marry a couple, I give them advice on birth control, compatibility in the sexual relationship, and the family budget. Then I talk to them about religion. Then I marry them."

The rector of a Protestant Episcopal church in Ann Arbor, Michigan, told a San Francisco church congress: "Even with those who do not go so far" (i.e., as endorsing promiscuity) "the idea that many of us had that such things as petting or overfamiliarity with the opposite sex should be saved at least until the time of engagement, if not until marriage, on the basis that married life would be happier, has disappeared."

The director of religion at a well-known California university championed laxity in this newspaper statement: "Our keen and racy college girls may shock you with breezy talks about birth control, boasts of practicing man's vices, laugh at coarse jokes, flirt with sex risks, and bid for astounding frankness; but when they settle down to honest-to-goodness living, most of them drop as by magic most of this high-powered slang talk, this free-and-easy love line, and this posed college chatter that shocks their sedate elders into scolding fits about 'the sins of this lawless generation.'"

The president of an Episcopal seminary asked a convocation of the Congregational Church whether the commandments and prohibitions of religious ethics were really anything more than ecstatic utterances of highly emotional men and women. Then he descended to these depths: "Nature stands above all creeds and dogmas, all codes and regulations. It is science, not religion, that tells us about nature. Of course, nature will triumph in the end. All things, all gods, all human society, will ultimately yield to the program of nature. Much of Christian ethics seems little more than whims and vagaries of Mrs. Grundy. The noble experiment of Prohibition or the equally unnatural present-day marriage legislation are both unscientific."

This trend is also noticeable in the utterances of a Committee on Marriage and Home of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ. One of the brochures published by this committee has been described in this thought-provoking review: "Had this pamphlet come out of Russia direct as one of their means of breaking down all morality, the family, and the home, as the final step toward Communism, we would have felt it well qualified to carry out the intent of its authors."

A Baptist group, meeting in New York City on October 2, 1934, passed this resolution: "We, the Interstate Evangelistic Association, in session at Calvary Baptist Church, with delegates and representatives from thirteen States, ... denounce ... the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America and urge that all conservative Christian churches immediately withdraw and disassociate themselves from said council. In this connection we denounce especially the countenance and support which said council is giving to the spread of indecent literature, designed, under false colors, to poison the minds of our youth. What has been done in this direction is so filthy as to pass belief. It constitutes a scandal and a shame to all decent people, Christian or non-Christian."

Significant side-lights on the widely heralded Reconciliation Trips advocated by the Federal Council of Churches, are furnished in three typical programs:

"Trip on Changes in Sex Attitude vs. Monogamy, Birth Control, Companionate Marriage, especially arranged by Prof. Leroy E. Bowman for his class at Columbia University."

"Margaret Sanger will direct inspection of Birth Control Clinic. Mrs. F. Robinson Jones, president, Board of Directors, American Birth Control League, on Birth Control. Frank Olmstead, friend of Judge Ben Lindsey, on Companionate Marriage, also speaker on Sex Attitudes vs. Monogamy."

"Dr. Eugene L. Swan on Love Art. Dr. Eliot White on Companionate Marriage. Love Art, which depicts the art of love where goodness and beauty meet in uplifting ecstasy, under the leadership of Dr. Eliot White, formerly of Grace Episcopal Church."

#### MODERN CHAMPIONS FOR DIVORCE AND BIRTH CONTROL

In the push for easier, cheaper, and quicker divorce some of the most enthusiastic advocates of this moral let-down have been the Unitarian-minded preachers and the radical teachers of heavily endowed but poorly attended divinity schools. How else can we interpret the practical endorsement of divorce furnished by the example of modern ministers or this assault on the sanctity of marriage by Anna Garland Spencer, a clergyman, who asks (The Family and Its Members, p. 244 ff.): "Now that the moral sense of most people allows another trial on Love's Rialto, there are many individuals who can leave 'that dead thing' to find its own grave and in the light of some new and dearer affection go on to a renewed promise of joy and life. Can we think that wrong?" What other interpretation can we place on the words of the Rev. John Thomp-son, Methodist minister in Chicago: "If Christ were on earth to-day, He would approve divorce in many instances of matrimonial unhappiness. He did not prohibit divorce as we know it. If He were in this country today, where we have kind, wise, and discriminating judges deciding on domestic infelicities, He might recognize more than one ground for divorce. Should two persons be compelled to live together when all affection which constitutes real marriage is dead? I am not alarmed at the increase in divorces"?

Modernism in the United States today stands committed to support the theory of the artificial limitation of the family. In 1931 the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America placed its sanction on birth control, following in this the liberal attitude of the Lambeth Conference in England. These American church-bodies are listed as supporters: Special Commission of the Presbyterian Church in America; Legislative Committee of the Ethical Culture Society; New York East Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church; Conference of Congregational Churches of Connecticut; Central Conference of American Rabbis; American Unitarian Association; Universalist General Convention; Southern California Conference, Methodist Episcopal Church; Board of Managers of Five Point Mission, Community Church of New York.

A magazine writer calls attention to the fact that many leaders of the clergy, far from frowning upon birth control, are recognizing it as "essential to the welfare of society." Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick is cited as one of its staunchest defenders, and his emphatic words are recorded: "The day will come when the old haphazard spawning of many children, with popular laudation as a reward and perhaps a letter of appreciation from the White House, will be looked upon as utter barbarism. ... You cannot trust God to bring everything out all right if you let the earth's population double every sixty years."

A symposium of clerical statements by New York preachers would reveal an outspoken endorsement of birth restriction that ranges from the pointed opinion of Dr. Karl Reiland, liberal Protestant Episcopalian ("The Church's attitude on birth control must change. It must support this method of raising the level of existence. Objections on religious grounds are all irrelevant"), to the repeated applause which metropolitan preachers have lent the Federal Council of Churches pronouncements.

Altogether, then, modernistic Protestantism as champion of the Christian home presents a sorry spectacle. Sophisticated preachers smile indulgently at marital standards. Divorce has too often lost its clerical stigma. The list of divorced doctors of divinity grows. Pulpit exponents of barnyard morality become louder. Zealous clerics make bids for cheap publicity by inviting the divorced son of an American President to church services. And all the while bewildered Christians ask: "If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?" (Ps. 11:3.)

#### THE EXILE OF SIN

We need not search far afield for the basic factor in the relation of unbelief and immorality. As soon as the philosophy of Havelock Ellis, Schmalhausen, Harry Elmer Barnes, enters the pulpit and permeates pastoral practices, we have an explanation for the sophisticated air that surrounds liberalistic preachers, and we understand the motivation of the new clergyman, so well described in this telltale sketch from Harper's (October, 1931): "He defends modern youth. ... He boasts of actors and actresses among his buddies, going backstage when opportunity allows. He visits artists in their studios and rushes into the pulpit to tell the world that these people, once looked upon as lechers and outcasts, are fundamentally good and essentially religious. He denies that the world is irreligious by denying irreligion."

The current trend of liberal Protestantism is directed toward the ignoring of sin. Dr. Don O. Shelton, president of the National Bible Institute of New York City, presents statistical evidence of the pulpit's silence on sin: "Sin has largely dropped out of the vocabulary of the modern church. Four New York morning papers, the Times, the Herald-Tribune, the World, and the American, last Monday generously gave space to summaries of forty-one sermons with an aggregate of more than 16,000 words. In these 'sin' was not used nor even remotely referred to, except in one brief summary of 106 words of a discourse given at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The omission of 'sin' from the Christian preachers' messages is astounding in view of the fact that 'sin' is a central word in the vocabulary of the Bible, in which it appears 416 times."

In the Living Church the new rector of a city parish receives this advice from one of his vestry: "Don't preach about sin; for none of the worshipers at the Church of the Holy Innocents is a sinner, at least none of the regular pew-holders."

With modern theology tacitly but determinately ruling out sin and substituting "complexes," "self-expression," "new freedom," "superiority to inhibitions," for the ugly, three-lettered word; with liberal church-leaders endorsing the "Follow your impulse" philosophy of atheist teachers, the spread of animalism receives powerful impetus. This indifference toward right and wrong helps produce the attitude which a feature-writer of the New York American scores in this sarcastic vein: "This is going to be a pretty good world in the very near future. Because sin is losing all its popularity and becoming as prosaic and innocuous as breakfast foods. Once sin was rare and exceptional. It was either black or purple or red. Now it is just a dull, faded mauve and as prevalent as hay-fever. 'Beautiful Sinners and Savage Sins' announces the advertisement of a new motion-picture. Ho-hum. Well, sin has got to be awfully savage these days to keep us from yawning. "Temptation' used to be something that a woman was taught to resist and a man was looking for. Now, every girl tries to look like a 'temptation.' "

#### BUCHMANISM AND ITS "SHARING"

A strange attitude toward sin is featured by the Oxford Group, popularly known as Buchmanism. Into this religious movement, which seeks to save the nation and civilization through Moral Rearmament, radical Modernists and conservative Fundamentalists are all welcomed, with no discrimination. One of its leaders wrote: "Some of us are Modernists, and some are Fundamentalists; but we do not quarrel. These difficulties simply do not count." One of the most enthusiastic supporters of the Oxford Group in the United States is the Christian Register (Unitarian), an avowed enemy of Christ's deity.

A characteristic teaching of this group, which has enlisted the support of thousands in upper-class society in America and abroad, is the practice of "sharing." Buchmanism requires that those who would enter into the fulness of its blessings learn openly to confess their sins and all that separates them from God. The initiate into Buchmanism is told to choose a sharing partner, to whom he reveals his secret sins. The very act of confessing becomes a virtue in itself.

After these sins have thus been shared, they are confessed to God, and the lives are "surrendered" to Him. This "surrender" is not to be confused with the spiritual conversion, the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word of God; for the Oxford "surrender" is first of all a resolve for a social, outward change. It resembles more the Mohammedan resignation to Allah.

The "sharing" and "surrender" usually occur at a house party. A particularly well-known house party — besides the annual meetings at Oxford — was the fashionable lodge at Briar Cliff Manor (Westchester County, New York) a few years ago, to which guests had come from various parts of the country and even from Europe. Here a former Glasgow Communist as well as several former football stars, a sprinkling of university professors, and a group of brokers gave their testimony. All of the 500 who attended the session, which lasted for ten days, were invited to share with one another. At the Monterey, California, 1939 house party, much the same procedure was followed.

"Sharing," the open avowal of sins, may become very dangerous. Experience has shown that very often these confessions deal with matters of sex. It was this emphasis, so we have been told, that provoked the ban of Buchmanism from Princeton. In the excerpt from a private letter written by a Princeton student in the Lutheran Herald of April 11, 1933, we read this revelation: "it is an undeniable fact that this 'sharing' of experiences almost always had the effect of placing a premium on past sins. I have been told by students who attended these house meetings that the one who made the greatest contribution to the meeting had the greatest sins to confess. As a matter of fact, however, I am sure that the Christianity of this group was not so perverse." This aspect of Buch-manism discloses another ugly characteristic. The confession dwelling largely on sex made these meetings little more than a realistic version of "True Confessions." Now, however, we are told that sex confessions are discouraged.

The Rev. Harold T. Commons, who was actively associated with the movement for three years and who attended many house parties, wrote, after severing his connections with the group, that the "method of open and public confession of sins is a very questionable procedure. It produces the desired psychological effect in the meeting, but it incites undue emotionalism and also tends to lower the standards and to produce, on the basis of sin, a sort of fellowship that seems to me very undesirable. Specific sins, after continued confession, seem not quite so terrible as they were at first. I well remember a statement by one of the leaders that 'the fellowship of sinners is more real than the fellowship of saints.'" Dr. G. H. Stevenson, Canadian physician, lists as one of the six points on which he indicts Buchmanism the "emotional orgies dealing with sex, which might become almost a verbal form of sex perversion by 'sharing' them with others."

#### THE APPEAL OF A CRISIS

The cry of this hour for all Christians in all churches must be: Back to the moral standards of Jesus Christ! Back to the sacredness and indissolubility of marriage! Back to the glory of parenthood and the blessedness of childhood! Back to the rigid requirements of purity and the stern disavowal of any compromise with shady immorality! Back to Christ for pardon and peace!

If this cry means that Christian churches banish from their pulpits and their theological institutions those who refuse to accept Christ's code of marital and domestic ethics; if it means that young people in Protestant denominations who know that the call to follow Christ is stronger than the call to follow applauded preachers rise up in pointed protest against every modernistic betrayal of Christian virtues, even if it means that congregations may be split into liberal and conservative elements, homes divided against themselves, ties of kinship and friendship may be torn, we still cry: Back to the moral standards of Jesus Christ!

### THE LITERATURE OF LUST

Many of them... brought their books together and burned them before all men. - Acts 19:19

The printed attack on marriage has steadily become more audacious. Sexual degenerates have torn down the last veil of reticence and made a mockery not only of marriage, but also of every ideal of decency. Humbert Wolfe, author of several volumes of prose and verse, a member of the British Labor Government, soliloquizes in the Saturday Review of Literature (May 7, 1932): "Is it possible, I have been driven to ask myself, as I contemplate the orgiastic development of the most admired contemporary litera-ture, that there exists anywhere in the Anglo-Saxon world such a thing as romantic love or happy marriage? I am indeed so overshadowed by what all the young and vigorous write and the old and feeble applaud that I am positively embarrassed to commit the words 'romantic love' and 'happy marriage' to paper." Outside the books issued under church influence or direction few printed appeals are raised in behalf of the blessings of love and marriage.

A deplorable aspect of this problem, however, is the frequent inability to convict offenders. Prosecutors decry the difficulty of securing a conviction and sentence in New York City, and since the present law limits prosecution to the place of mailing, most of the obscene literature trials are held before juries in that city. Postal inspectors call New York the center of the lewd-book trade.

#### RACKET BOOKS

Swelling the tide of printed propaganda for immorality to a new high level, crafty publishers present allegedly professional treatises on questions of sex and marriage. These books profess a broad sincerity in their desire to stimulate the public study of the physiological side of marriage in all its details. Declaring that its purpose is "for the good of the race," a New York concern sends out a book on sex with the following emphasis: "This remarkable book is different from all others because it is frank and fearless. . . So outspoken is this book that the Federal Government has twice attempted to ban it from this country."

Similarly notorious are the various publications advertised in the cheap magazines. These are books which are mailed C. O. D. in "plain wrappers," the morbid advertisements of which ask: "Are you discontented with the stupid lies and furtive, ashamed answers the world gives you in place of the naked, fearless truth you desire? Do you want some sane, safe, unashamed advice? Clip the coupon below. Send it today without any money, and in a few days you will receive the most startling surprises of your life."

Appealing to a morbid inquisitiveness, particularly of young readers, they advertise: "Here is a book full of the curious secrets and wisdom that only doctors possess, things that people never talk about, facts about a safe and sane sex-life and how to obtain it. Frank, outspoken, and daring in its modern views, it is nevertheless the very book needed for adolescent youth as a guard against error."

Or they address their intrigue to moronic minds in such invitations as these: "Nature has given you a mysterious power that psychologists call sex attraction. If you understand the use of this fascinating gift, you are sure to be popular at parties, dances, and picnics, beloved and admired and successful. By learning to understand this magic power, you can be successful in the fascinating game of love, sought after and admired by many, with loneliness barred forever from your life."

A new field of exploitation has been opened in "sex magnetism." The circulars of an Eastern publishing company, eminently successful in this field, feature these bold, arresting head-lines: "Are you engaged to be married? Wait! The chances are twenty to one that your affianced is temperamentally unfit for you. Why twenty to one? Because only one marriage in every twenty is a happy one. Sex magnetism will show you the truth that you do not want to find out when it is too late. If, after you study sex magnetism, you ascertain that the engagement must be broken, just permit your affianced to study the course with you, and the separation will be agreed to by both parties. This has always been the case."

If the intelligent reader, whose sensibilities are not outraged by this crude display and the subsequent description of the sixty-two great "truths" of sex magnetism, has the courage to read more about the red fire of passion, he will be told that the former price of this volume of new revelation was $25, but that, "realizing the times and because millions of men and women need its revelations, need them badly and quickly," the price has been slashed to $2.95. This, we declare, is $3.00 too much.

Many of these books lack genuine intention to help solve the problems they emphasize. A study of their contents often reveals much unnecessary, erotic material. Few of these publications are the work of a recognized author or issued by a standard publishing house. Books on birth control are often sent free of charge as extra inducements for the purchase of the "fascinating and helpful volume." Any one who permits himself to be deluded into signing the special cut-rate coupon which offers to send a volume, advertised as a reprint of a limited, private edition (originally priced at $15), for $2.98, will find that he has made a poor bargain, even as far as the mechanics of the book are concerned. In a few weeks, when letters advertising Parisian love secrets, matrimonial prospects, unexpurgated editions of orgiastic writings begin to flood his mail, he will realize that his name and address have been sold to some of the most unscrupulous filth-mongers in the country. I have in my files direct evidence of this name-selling with the prices demanded for customer lists. No trust should be placed in these glib promises "to keep your letter strictly confidential." In Nostrums and Quackery (Vol. II, p. 178), by Arthur J. Cramp, M. D., the reader finds a picture of 1,000 bundled letters mailed to a Joliet, Illinois, women's medical-benefit association under the pledge of strictest secrecy. Together with 130,000 other names they were, however, sold to a New York letter bureau which makes a business of buying and selling letters and addresses.

In their zeal for spreading information on sex subjects, we find that the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, the Y. M.C. A., and other organizations have issued much literature. There can be no doubt that this publication program has been prompted by good intentions; but a glance at some of the material calls for criticism. For instance, we find official endorsement for the works of Briffault and others who ridicule religion. The late Havelock Ellis was called "the best interpreter available of the wonders and beauty of sex." Ben Lindsey's Companionate Marriage is described as a book that attempts to work out solutions on a basis "nearest to the ideal under the circumstances." Margaret Sanger is mentioned as giving "practical advice to the engaged and newly married." The same attitude characterizes other literature of these two bodies. Some of it, I do not hesitate to declare, is fundamentally objectionable.

There are well-written and trustworthy books which reverently discuss the facts of life. These books are recommended by the Church in the same definite manner that the objectionable titles are rejected.

#### SEX-MAD MAGAZINES

The indictment of pornography in print is heightened by certain American periodicals. We not only publish more magazines than any other people; we not only issue larger and more lavish magazines than the European publishers can afford; we not only boast of the most formidable subscription lists in the world; but, with the single exception of Russia, we also have the greatest number of magazines that cultivate license. The growth of printed lewdness is astonishing. It is estimated that between 1870 and 1919 hardly twenty-five sexy publications were issued in the entire country. Between 1920 and 1935 the number skyrocketed to 291. From 1933 to 1938 ninety-two new magazines of this type made their appearance.

An examination of the story plots featured by popular magazines from 1900 to 1905 has revealed that in only 3 per cent the extramarital sex relations of the hero or heroine were condoned. In 1932, however, a similar investigation showed that in 45 per cent of the magazine plots such relations were passed without rebuke.

Not only the popular magazines but publications that have been regarded as intellectual and "highbrow" have on repeated occasions deserted the high standards of their founders to join the extreme leftists. Even Harper's and The Atlantic Monthly have no unimpeachable record in this respect. Within recent months magazines of this type have featured articles in which a mother brazenly endorses premarital relations for her own daughter and a co-ed tabulates in detail the alleged intimate experiences of her fellow-students.

Besides, a new group of magazines has hurtled itself into a conspicuous place on the news-rack, the publications specifically devoted to the presentation by word and picture of the morbid, the risqué, the sensational. In this group we find some of the newer pictorial publications which, under the slogan "A picture is worth a thousand words," now make the appeal of the sordid even more wide-spread, — the sophisticated magazines, like Esquire, which in their suggestive pictures and vile humor are undisguised menaces to the morals of every reader.

Periodically authorities are aroused to their duties, and a cleanup order is issued. Not long ago the Postmaster-General barred one of the excessively objectionable issues from the United States mail. But censorship in this country is often grossly deficient. Our neighbors to the North bar more than a hundred of our magazines from the Canadian mails. In Australia, as the Christian Century reports (January 4, 1939), the flood of indecent magazines that pours into that country has led to custom regulations banning "not only indecent, obscene, or blasphemous works or articles" but also literature which in the opinion of the minister, and whether by picture, (a) unduly emphasizes matters of sex or crime or (b) is calculated to encourage depravity." Seventy-two American magazines are outlawed under these regulations!

Indecency never dies, and the devil of impurity, if driven away, often returns with seven other evil spirits. John S. Sumner, who for twenty-five years was representative for the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and who has long fought printed indecency, declares: "We try to catch these art magazines; generally we are successful. Unfortunately we can't stop them altogether from being published because the next issue after their conviction may be one that is completely innocuous and clean; only by and by, when the publisher assumes that our watchfulness is on the wane, dirty material is sneaked in again. Here you are not dealing exclusively with petty criminals ignorant of the law. You are dealing all too often with publishers who can afford to employ clever attorneys. I recall the case of a publisher of no fewer than four dirty magazines whom we arraigned. His attorney pleaded that the man had a boy in college and a girl in high school, that the publicity following conviction would ruin the lives of his children. We promised that the publicity would be withheld if, in turn, he gave us a written promise to destroy his magazines and never again enter the shady publishing business. He wrote that promise. We kept ours. A few months later I read in the Bridgeport newspapers that he had been arrested on the charge of distributing indecent literature. Many of these publishers are like the many-headed hydra. Chop off one of its heads, and two grow in its place."

Nauseated by this magazine sewage, Frank R. Kent, Washington newspaper man, sounds the alarm against the "truly extraordinary extent to which the country is drenched with smut by the steadily increasing stream of pornographic periodicals and dirty fiction magazines." He declares: "The plain truth is that in the matter of literary lewdness we have taken the lead away from the French. It used to be that Paris held the palm for this sort of thing. Americans in the French capital were accustomed to marvel that a civilized nation should openly permit the sale of such filth, and it was taken to indicate that the French as a whole were essentially a dirty-minded people. But they do not think that now. They can get here in the old home town not only more such publications, but dirtier, both as to "art" and as to reading-matter. And not only have we produced a great crop of coarseness peculiarly our own, but the more obscene French papers have now been translated into English and appear on the news-stands along with the originals. In the small towns they are seen in the greatest profusion, and make an imposing array. When you stop to analyze, scrutinize, and check up, there is here presented more reason for apprehension as to the future than in any other single symptom in America to-day."

This is no exaggeration. The "art" publications peddled to our high-school youth show that the debauches of Sodom and Gomorrah are perpetuated within our national borders. A New York committee found that in certain popular short-story magazines 80 per cent of the stories were "off color," while others used from 50 to 90 per cent of their space for suggestive pictures. Stripped of their literary pretensions, these poisoned sheets are combinations of printed and pictorial degeneracy that must be repudiated by every Christian and that should be proscribed forever by the laws of the land.

We may well conclude that the racy, sensual magazines contribute to the staggering increase of sex crimes. In this connection the New York Police Commissioner reports that during 1936 sex offenses to the number of 1,251 were reported in that city, while during 1937 the number had increased more than 50 per cent, to 1,892. In a bulletin issued by Notre Dame University a large part of the presentation is devoted to the statement of a young man now in prison for his sex crimes. In part he says: "I'm no different from any one else. I can see now what made me what I am. It didn't come from inside me, but from outside, ... from those filthy magazines that you nice people allow to be plastered all over your news-stands... I was a kid at a news-stand when I started down. ... It was one of your respectable citizens who started me down, the wealthy guy that owned the news-stand. He used to bring his rotten magazines to my stand and show me the worst pictures and say, 'Hot stuff! I'll make you rich!' How was I to know that the stuff was poison? Where's the big shot that gave me the start? I know. He's still doing his corrupt business, and he's free."

More veiled in their assault on the virtues of courtship and marriage, more wide-spread in their distribution, and therefore more harmful are the widely heralded "true story" magazines. These confessions, regularly written in the first person, cultivate the impression that they are authentic revelations, designed to show the pitfalls of courtship and married life and to demonstrate how young people can emerge both better and nobler from harrowing sex ex-periences. Never in the history of American printing has any type of publication been so welcome as these sheets. To the everlasting discredit of an irresponsible coterie in the American clergy it must be said that among the strongest endorsements these publications have received are the florid sanctions of American ministers.

In two propaganda brochures, entitled, respectively, What Ministers of the Gospel Think and Say of the World's Fastest-growing Magazine and A Magazine with a Great Moral Force, we find these almost unbelievable statements over the signatures of clergymen:

A national secretary of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America states that this magazine is "very greatly needed" and will "tend to encourage good reading, especially by our young people."

A New York clergyman of unidentified connection vigorously asserts: "It is my sincere conviction that this magazine is the most uplifting force in this country."

A presiding elder of an Oklahoma Methodist Episcopal district claims: "I think your magazine will be a great blessing to the young life of our country."

A college president in Illinois permits this to appear in print over his signature: "I am very happy to commend the excellent purpose you have before you in publishing the magazine. You are following the correct educational ideal, and your efforts deserve hearty response and support."

A Missouri Methodist Episcopal preacher waxes sermonic and pens these pastoral lines: "The plan and scope of the True Story magazine impresses me as deserving the highest praise and fullest cooperation from all workers for the uplift of humanity. I bid you Godspeed."

An Episcopal rector, a D.D., in Idaho, goes above the sky limit: "I commend this, in my estimation, greatest of story maga-zines. Would that every growing boy and girl could peruse its pages!"

A senile preacher in Wisconsin regards this magazine as a means of grace and opines: "Although eighty-one, I love your magazine. True stories build morals, lead souls to accept the divine will towards humanity. My soul craves for the truth."

In the light of the actual influence exerted by this type of magazine such clerical endorsements are lurid follies. When some of these ministerial enthusiasts were subsequently questioned, they refused to restate their pastoral approval. It is not without some significance that the promotion department of this "confession" magazine admitted, when pressed for an answer, that it was unable to state whether the clergymen who had lent their names in the spread of this publication had received a year's subscription gratis. Be this as it may, however, the fact remains that, whether one thousand or ten thousand clergymen endorse these publications, this approval does not justify their existence. One of the most salacious books ever written was printed with the papal imprimatur, the official stamp of the Pope's approval. Yet even devout Catholics would not attempt to employ the principle of the argument which these "uplift" magazines advance, and say that, just because the Pope endorsed a prize of Italian pornography, it deserves to be scattered broadcast.

In meaningful contrast to the unbecoming attitude of these clergymen (who in some instances vouched for the magazine without seeing it or who, when they found that the "truth" taxed even their elastic credulity, confessed, as did a Michigan ecclesiastic: "At times one is incredulous, for it seems as if some of the true stories were humanly impossible. However, if MacFadden vouches for them, I can swallow even some 'whales'") is the aloofness of the New York public library. These magazines, which significantly have become the most popular reading-material in the Atlanta peniten-tiary, are barred from the Gotham library system as "below the standard." They condemn themselves before the tribunal of common decency as miserable misrepresentations, featuring twisted ideals and warped morality.

In Collier's a prolific author of these "true stories" admits: "I have made a thousand confessions, but this is my last, and the first sincere one I have ever made for publication." Admitting that he wrote endless pages of sentimental slush because, as some one else has said, "the wages of sin is a check from a confession magazine," he states: "I have sinned more often — on paper — than Mephisto himself. I have done more severe penance — on paper — than the most devout Trappist monk. My conscience has been purged, calcimined, and resurrected on an average of three times a week. I have sinned and sinned and sinned — but I always told. I am the king of confessors. I sit on a throne embroidered with rehearsed sins. I shake cast-off consciences out of my sleeves. My subjects are all gloomy characters with dark pasts, although a few of them gaze wistfully into the future toward the promise of another sunrise."

The commercialism of these magazines shows itself in their advertising columns, which feature Gipsy dream-books, sex secrets, Parisian portraits, obscene photos, the salacious writings of atheists, Hindu crystal balls, zodiac signs, luck-in-love rings, and similar atrocities.

In addition, the business interests supporting these publications do not always inspire our confidence. One of these magazines conspicuously bears the name of a man who was arrested, prosecuted, and found guilty of spreading improper literature. When a magazine with such antecedents constitutes itself a guardian of marriage morals, no one should be accused of prejudice if he is inclined to feel that the widely heralded "uplift" movement bears only the earmarks of financial uplift for the publishers.

The strongest objection is furnished by the stories themselves. Their pages fairly reek with disgusting scenes and with transgressions of chastity. Adultery follows upon adultery, one unclean scene gives way to another, and the whole is repulsive. The publishers claim, it is true, that they do not reward iniquity and that sin is punished. But there is proof positive that in many instances these claims fall flat, that passion often triumphs, and that perverted sexual relations are condoned. Reading through five pages of seductive scenes and then coming to a brief paragraph at the conclusion or to an even briefer sentence which states, in effect, that after all it is best to be good, is just as valueless in helping young people to purity as a tissue-paper parasol would be in a cloudburst!

If it were not for the fact that these treacherous sheets are sometimes found in Christian homes and avidly read by a certain type of church-member, it would not be necessary to appeal for cooperation in banning this periodical poison from all self-respecting homes. Censorship, legislation, clean-literature campaigns, even if they were applied, could offer only incidental help. The decisive factor is the subscription list. Keep it down!

#### GANGRENOUS FICTION

Similarly hostile to high marriage standards is the godless novel. The motion-picture and the plays of the legitimate stage have bolted the bounds of chastity, it is true, but even in their widest departure from decency few footlight or screen performances have featured unnatural vice and perversion. Yet novels that have come into marked prominence in the last years tell all and expatiate upon lurid emotional processes, with details in which only the printed page can indulge.

Even much of the less objectionable fiction of the day comes from the pen of men and women who are unsparing in their denunciation of the present marriage contract. Joseph Hergesheimer complains that marriage is a "notorious failure." Faith Baldwin, who has written many stories and books about love and life, insists: "Marriage isn't ordained in heaven, let them say what they will. It's an unnatural relationship, and there is proof that it was started as an institution to protect property." H. G. Wells, British Utopian, calls for a "courageous revision of the marital tie" and condescendingly admits: "The Christian marriage, like most marriage institutions of the world, meets the needs of a peasant life with passable success." Owen Johnson, author of triangle and social-problem novels, predicts startling changes in America's marriage ideals, and claims: "Out of the chaos of family life today will come a new sort of order." Booth Tarkington tells the million-plus readers of the American Magazine that marriage is "an increasing cause of human unhappiness" and demands a new matrimonial deal of "complete freedom, independence, and self-determination."

The worst offenders are often the best sellers. Some who for sheer brilliancy of literary attainments have been the recipients of wide-spread plaudits and have been honored by Pulitzer prizes and Nobel awards are hopelessly negative from a religious and moral point of view. Writers like Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, James Joyce, Sinclair Lewis, and others may serve as illustrations. Commenting on a book by the last-named author, William Allen White remarks: "Seventy-two seductions in one book are too many." Lewis's forte consists in denunciations, particularly of clergymen and the Church. One of his well-known novels pictures a minister who is dishonest and perverted. "The fact that no such minister exists in the Church," remarks a reviewer, "or, if he gets in, does not continue to stay in the Church did not make any difference to Lewis. He wanted to depict a bad minister." The zeal with which he prosecuted this purpose was indeed worthy of a higher aim. First of all he hired a Unitarian preacher who had started his ministry as a Methodist to give him technical advice and act as a detail man. Then, we are told, "for six months he subscribed to many church-papers and read them diligently. He had his work-room filled with Bible dictionaries, theological works, Methodist disciplines, hymn-books of every type." A visiting preacher remarks: "I have often taken stock of his library during the incubation of the new book and found him with a preacher's library larger than many a preacher has had after ten years in the ministry."

Similar determination is betrayed in his other books, which offer a sordid record of attempts at seduction, abortion, unhappy marriages, adultery, open flaunting of the law, illegitimate birth, divorce, and the long catalog of similar atrocities. Yet Sinclair Lewis's Main Street sold in 725,000 copies; his Elmer Gantry reached 400,000, — a total of a million and an eighth copies of a penetrating attack against Christian marriage.

Below all this is a substratum of indecency. It has remained for this decade to feature the novel that glorifies ugly, unnatural vice, to flaunt the amatory curiosa before the eye of the youth of the nation, to circulate the filth that was once limited to privately published editions, to revive the smut of classical degeneracy (against which even a pagan morality protested), and to appeal for the sale of unexpurgated editions.

Laura Simmons, professional book-reviewer, writing in the New York Times, confesses: "Even a hard-boiled reviewer has been shocked to enter an elegant, immaculate library, where a speck of dust would distress our gentle hostess, and find tables and chairs strewn with appalling dirt and sewage supposed to 'broaden' the family tastes in drama and literature."

Some time ago a publisher sent me for review an attractively printed book described on the jacket with this endorsement: "Here is a big American novel - big in size, big in conception, big in the vast sweep of its background. It presents something new, an entirely modern treatment of the great Western trek, of Indian raids, of railroad building.... It will be acclaimed as one of the big books of the year and has qualities which, we believe, will place it among the lasting volumes of our times." I sent this volume for review to a pastor in California, who carefully read the book and then wrote: "The first fifty pages seemed innocent and interesting enough; but then the reader is suddenly introduced to 'Frenchy' in a salacious hotel-room scene. ... With all due respect to the historical setting and the many fine scenes of early railroad and pioneer life in Texas, the book, to my mind, is rotten to the core, having no less than 400 pages interspersed with minute descriptions of... lustful scenes... These pages leave very little to the imagination, and I am glad that my children did not get hold of the book. In fact, I think it ought to be barred from the mails. I could not write a review for publication lest undue and additional attention be called to the book. This reading has been a lesson to me never to approve any book without having read all of it." - A mere cursory glance at the opening pages of any modern novel, least of all, at the publisher's blurb on the jacket, will not give an adequate picture of the contents. The introduction to filth is often disguised and veneered.

With printed impurity more accessible than ever before, we need not search far afield for the agencies that help to spread this vice. Lending libraries, which have grown up overnight as so many poisonous fungi, clutter their shelves with titles that help to initiate high-school boys and girls into the sins of the flesh. The corner drug store, the same institution that offers a lavish variety of antiseptics, antitoxins, disinfectants, and sterilizing supplies of all kinds, now often displays the printed filth that infects the mind and soul and destroys the tissues of purity. Here, where the pure-food-and-drug act of a scrupulous law demands that nothing inferior or adulterated be sold, a poison is dispensed that stunts the brain and paralyzes the soul. Here is the worst that rodent minds have ever written, offered to the children of the nation for two pennies a day. This, we submit, is the cheapest moral dynamite known to any age.

#### WHAT PRICE BAWDINESS?

The printed depravity of the past may have killed the purity of its thousands, for pornography is an ancient sin; but the pages of present-day impurity slaughter their ten thousands. Scoring the heroine in a widely read novel, Mr. George W. Ochs Oakes, former editor of Current History, summarizes: "Never a word of condemnation of her immoral life; no disapproval of scoffing at re-ligion; no dispraise of scornful ridicule of the sanctity of marriage no penalty for debauchery, not even remorse; instead of making retribution or atonement, rich rewards of halcyon days of marital bliss are vouchsafed the unregenerate culprit. And this mess of corruption, garnished by a faultless hand with felicitous pictures and dazzlingly beautiful imagery, the masterpiece of adroit craftsmanship, this foul witch's cauldron, is served to self-respecting men and women, to eager boys and ardent girls, to distort time-honored standards, to undermine their beliefs, to implant a virus of scorn for homely virtues, to shatter the precious maxims and formulas which have preserved our conventions and safeguarded our morality. ... The heart sickens; the soul falters. To feel that in the years to come those who hold most dear the standards we cherish, the fundamentals which we have regarded as the basis of our civilization, that all these will be blasted, blackened, and corrupted by the vile pictures of our life which are drawn by recognized, popular writers of our day and are bequeathed to those who follow after us is the damning legacy of our times!"

Critical, analytical Joseph Wood Krutch admits: "If one turns to the smarter of those novelists who describe the doings of the more advanced set of those who are experimenting with life, to, for example, Mr. Aldous Huxley or Mr. Ernest Hemingway, one will discover in their tragic farces the picture of a society which is at bottom in despair.... To Huxley and Hemingway — I take them as the most conspicuous exemplars of a whole school — love is at times only a sort of obscene joke. .. But the joke is one which turns quickly bitter upon the tongue."

The avid rehearsal in print of this sophisticated sin often stimulates the desire to keep up with the hot pace set by the author and his characters. Every suggestion of immorality or glorification of a triangle relationship is a potential incentive to parallel wrong. The assassin of President McKinley admitted that he had been incited to murder by the writings of Emma Goldman. Jesse Pomeroy, one of the most vicious murderers in American criminology records, confessed that he had read scores of cheap novels on murder, robbery, and crime. The seeds that have been planted in impressionable minds by these sowers of impure suggestions have helped to produce a terrifying harvest.

James Dougall, the English writer in the London Daily Express who led the crusade against The Well of Loneliness, summarizes the consequences of this abandon and license: "It is easier to corrupt the mind than to purify it. The poisonous influence of these depraved works of genius is twofold. They debauch the imagination of their readers. They also debauch the imagination of the novelists who are forced to compete with them in the market." To meet the competition of the cheap magazine, the radio has frequently become allied with the printed page in the attack on the home. America, the Catholic weekly, declares that of the twenty quarter-hour dramatic sketches broadcast daily between eight in the morning and five in the evening, sixteen base their theme on the disregard of the marriage bond. In many other broadcasts the marriage relation is likewise held up for coast-to-coast ridicule. Some comedians are notorious for their sarcastic jibes at love and home-life.

Small wonder that as a nation we laugh scornfully at the sanctity of marriage, that standards of marital right and wrong have often lost their hold on the American mind! Just as the narcotic addict becomes habituated to steadily increasing measures of an opiate, so the blasé philosophy continually demands a stronger dosage of this printed poison.

But great wonder that an unexplainable inactivity on the part of many Christians in this country permits this situation to pass without forceful protest! The Church has repeatedly voiced its disapproval, it is true; but its words are mocked by this glut of nauseating fiction. Its best efforts are weakened by every countermove in homes that tolerate any form of this literature of lust. Add to this the corruption of politicians and officials who extend protection to guilty booksellers and newsdealers, the utter inadequacy of American law to cope with the hazards of this situation, the restricted scope and power of civic societies, whose efforts to ban objectionable publications often result in publicity and free ad-vertising, and altogether we have a discouraging picture of America's slow, but noticeable surrender of its citadel of decency. Not until Christian families shall bar forever all contact with this contagious impurity; not until leaders in our congregations lend their individual and cooperative efforts to civic movements designed to send pornography back to the hell from which it was spawned; not until graft and extortion have been minimized in our political life and men of integrity are willing to assume leadership in our community affairs; not until the Church strengthens its own field forces and at the same time encourages more insistently the writing and reading of the better books — can we begin to regain the territory lost in the last decades.

The fight against filth will be an up-hill battle. For several years correspondents have sent me printed circulars describing a book issued by an atheist publishing company in New York City. These sheets advertise a book which is said to unmask the Bible and brand it as a deceitful volume. The illustrations printed on this circular are so vile that help was asked in having these repulsive pictures barred from the mail.

Now, the United States postal law is clear on this subject. Its provisions specify: "Every obscene, lewd, lecherous, filthy book, pamphlet, picture of an indecent character, ... and every letter, packet, or package... containing any filthy, vile, or indecent thing ... shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post-office." However, when I brought these lewd pictures to the attention of the authorities in Washington, the solicitor of the post-office declared that the United States mail would not bar this publication, although every decent person in the country who might be forced to look at these drawings would immediately brand them as lewd and demand that the United States follow the ruling of the Canadian government in refusing this book entrance to their dominion. I did not base the objection on the fact that these circulars were anti-Biblical; the claim was simply this, that these pictures were indecent, displaying situations never revealed in the Bible.

Because the battle is so hard, it must be fought with increased determination. If Government supervision is lax and its statutes remain unenforced, we may see the forces of protest organize in our own cities and consign piles of indecent publications to the flames. The apostle did not condemn the burning of the disavowed magical literature in Ephesus, even though he knew that after the smoke of these sorcery texts, valued at 50,000 pieces of silver, had disappeared, witchcraft would continue to hold its treacherous sway. When Luther threw the papal bull into the flames, he, too, realized that, though he might destroy that document, he could not completely wipe spiritual arrogance off the face of the earth. While the flaming piles could never be made large enough to consume the total tonnage of cloacal filth in our country, these fires would be more than gestures; they would burn, like the Indian flares that once lighted our Western heavens, as war-fires summoning the nation's youth to a crusade against filth.

### MORONIC MOTION-PICTURES

The lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. - 1 John 2:16

The weekly motion-picture attendance in our country equals the entire population of the country, according to the claim of Hollywood statistician A. C. Martin. Independent investigators (Dr. Edgar Dale in Children's Attendance at Motion Pictures) present a more conservative estimate of 77,000,000. Half-way between these calculations is the figure of Recent Social Trends, which placed the weekly attendance at 100,000,000. We can form some tangible conception of the winding queues at the cinema ticket offices when we realize that,- even on the basis of the most conservative estimate, our weekly motion-picture attendance exceeds the total population of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Portugal, Persia, Mexico, Bolivia. Every six months American motion-picture theaters attract a throng larger than the entire population of the globe.

With this tremendous following it is difficult to overestimate the influences that the screen exerts in molding popular opinion. The motion-picture is the most decisive influence in the lives of many millions of Americans; it has become the matrix of their thoughts, words, and actions.

Since investigations have shown that at least 28,000,000 minors are found in this weekly attendance, screen performances must help shape young people's hopes and habits. Scientific research has established the fact that the plastic minds of adolescent youth are profoundly, and sometimes permanently, influenced by the suggestions which the cinema extends through the eye gate and ear gate. Because themes that center about love and marriage form most of the plots, the motion-picture theater with its adjuncts (the motion-picture magazines, the newspaper features of Hollywood and film-dom, and the radio publicity for screen stars) becomes for millions the greatest single molder of standards for courtship, marital morality, and home-life.

This question, then, cannot be side-tracked: What are the influences which the motion-pictures exert on the central issues of young lives? Are they helpful, instructive, ennobling? Or have they furnished the design for that loose pattern of marriage and home-life which we behold on all sides?

#### CINEMA PROPAGANDISTS

The ranks of the film champions have never been thin. Propaganda literature from Hollywood maintains that prison wardens, reform-school matrons, and social-service workers recognize the corrective influences of motion-pictures and have found them conspicuous aids to purity and morality. Much of this could be true; for the screening of a clean, elevating plot with dramatic emphasis upon the elements of virtue can furnish greater incentive for good than the same story printed in book form. This remarkable invention, capable of almost immeasurable uplift, designed to provide enjoyable amusement and harmless entertainment, could be made to serve refining interests. That these high ends are not achieved, that even the instructive and correctional value of motion-pictures has been overemphasized, is clear from the summary of Herbert Blumer and Philip Hauser in Movies, Delinquency, and Crime, which says: "We have no instance in our materials where an individual was completely deterred from a delinquent or criminal career through the influences of motion-pictures."

To regain some of the confidence which its policies have sacrificed, the motion-picture industry (confronted by the attack on box-office receipts led by the Catholic Legion of Decency and similar Protestant protests) insists that it has featured films with the lesson that virtue is its own reward and that vice brings its own punishment. This, however, is often merely a sop. Several years ago the British Film Commission reported against pictures in which the temptation or "the description of the wrong takes five sixths of the time and the heroic triumph at the end is very short." "The temptation," the report continues, "leaves more impression on the mind than the short and speedy triumph at the end."

An analysis of popular films shatters the claim that the screen is a building factor in moral development. In forty typical pictures, featuring fifty-seven criminals and listing sixty-two specific crimes, only seven of these lawbreakers were arrested with the implication of punishment; four others were taken into the toils of the law, but subsequently released; four more, also apprehended, were permitted to escape; twenty-four were punished by without-the-law methods; fifteen of these so-called heroes went scot-free, their crimes ranging from house-breaking, through theft and embezzlement, to kidnaping and murder. In seventeen other cases the punishment was merely accidental.

In the face of this crime glorification it is difficult to understand the endorsement of the moral value in motion-pictures by Albert E. Wiggam, D. Sc., in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, March 27, 1933. Here he asks the question: "Have the movies tended to increase the seriousness of young people about marriage?" and answers: "I feel so, because never before did young people have a chance to study marriage except that of their own parents. Most people do not know that nearly all movies are tested on groups of average young people before being released and their suggestions are carefully considered. Young people see in the films the results of loyalty, sacrifice, and devotion." The combined talent of Hollywood's public-relations committees and publicity bureaus could not have spoken more enthusiastically than Dr. Wiggam — nor more completely misrepresented the tendency of the average motion-picture.

#### FILM MORALITY TABULATED

If, then, we discount these exaggerations and agree that the cinema offers little incentive to a healthy appreciation of Christian marriage, this question presents itself: Is their moral influence negative, dangerous, destructive?

We are not left to find an answer in vague conjectures.During the last years film reactions have been tested and tabulated in a far-reaching investigation. Under the support of the Payne Fund and at the request of the Motion-picture Research Council a series of scientific studies were conducted from 1929 to 1933, the mere recording of which required nearly 3,000 printed pages. The contributors were well-known educators, scientists, psychologists, sociologists, and the program, the first comprehensive survey of this kind ever undertaken, was inaugurated under the chairmanship of the late Dr. John Grier Hibben, then president of Princeton. Its findings are compiled with the cautious objectivity of scientific approach. As one reads the pages of the twelve studies, one cannot escape the conviction that the investigators are at pains to avoid any debatable conclusion.

Dr. Dale, examining 115 representative films, found that in 22 of the pictures illicit love was featured in the lives of 35 leading characters. In addition, he catalogued 54 murders, 71 deaths by violence, 59 cases of assault and battery, 30 hold-ups, and 21 kidnappings, together with other acts of violence, a total of 449 crimes committed or attempted in 115 pictures. He showed that in 49 of these pictures the bedroom is a prominent locale and that more than three quarters of all the pictures exhibit liquor situations. His study is but one of many parallel investigations which led to essentially the same findings. In spite of Mr. Hays's new code of morality, promulgated March 31, 1930, according to which the motion-pictures promised "to be good," the Churchman offers this record of 228 films released in the following year, which may be regarded as the first-fruits of this new moral code: 41 films with gangsters, racketeers, bandits, blackmailers, crooks, and gamblers; 27 films with prostitutes and mistresses; 65 films with illegal relations, marital infidelities, dishonorable pro-posals, suggestive talk and all kinds of immoral situations; 3 films in which the heroine gave up her virtue to "save" another.

#### THE MOTION-PICTURE MASQUERADE OF MARRIAGE

The mosaic of marriage pieced together from America's feature films is often a hideous caricature. The premium which we have been accustomed to put on decency in social relations is often forgotten, and tribute is paid both to sophistication and to the evasion of time-honored morality. The primary conception of marriage as a life-long union is laughed away. Divorce is frequent and facile. Transgressions of the moral code are pictured realistically when glorified sin parades in the luxury of its purple and gold while virtue limps in rags.

Even pagan conventions have been outraged. The New Life Association, a Chinese organization which seeks a moral rebirth for China's four hundred millions, has brought pressure to bear on the Nanking government in the effort to ban salacious American movies. Lo Kang, chief film censor, complains that Hollywood's scenario-writers present pictures of love and luxury that will damage the morals and the morale of his countrymen. And Sherwood Eddy (Russia Today, p. 172) summarizes the Soviet attitude toward pictures with the Hollywood trade-mark: "A few American films ... are used in Russia for sheer amusement, but nine tenths of the American picture would be excluded as too demoralizing or as inculcating false ideals regarding wealth, luxury, drinking, sex, and crime."

In spite of repeated promises to the contrary the film studios still cater too frequently to the morbid tastes of the American public and constantly whet the appetite of their audiences for presentations against which the common morality of men must rise up in protest. It is not accidental that in all the years of motion-picture history sex situations, sensual extravagances, and appeals to passion have been among the outstanding contributions of this industry, that the words "man," "love," and "woman" have been used more frequently in titles than any other. It is a deliberate pandering to immorality when the sales literature emanating from Hollywood and directed to the theater-owners throughout the country feature attacks on the intimate issues in marriage life like these:

Unmarried Wives. Here's a title that will probably bring in a good many without further exploitation.

Sackcloth and Scarlet. The woman who takes and the woman who gives.

Grounds for Divorce. Is "till death do us part" the bunk?

The Dark Swan. Has the woman the right to steal the intimate things the world denies her?

The Age of Innocence. A beautiful woman running amuck while all society suffers.

Mr. Paul G. Cressey, in Boys Movies and City Streets, collaborating with Frederick M. Thrasher, discusses the catch-lines and illustrated posters that are flaunted in the foyers of typical motion-picture houses. I hesitate to print the details here. But Henry James Forman, in Our Movie-made Children, a book which I would put into every family with adolescents, concludes (p. 256): "The investigators believe that this type of advertising doubtless stimulates certain sexual and morbid interests. It is also a fact contributing to sexual precocity. They know whereof they speak, because they have cases on record of such positive mischief and unwholesome stimulation."

I submit one sample of a newspaper advertisement, the suggestions for which are furnished to the exhibitors by the publicity departments of the studios. Read the following bait and lure printed in the Lexington (Kentucky) Herald, advertising the film Divorce among Friends, and you have a sample. of the immorality that regulates the motion-picture industry. Against a background decorated by an undraped female figure we find these "rules" for "The New Marriage":

1.  Don't let marriage interfere with pleasure.
2.  Love and let love.
3.  Fair exchange's no snobbery.
4.  Marry in haste — divorce with pleasure.
5.  Every man should take a wife — but be careful whose wife you take!
    Below come these catch-phrase head-lines:
    Wedding Bells. Off with the old love —
    Teasing Bells. On with the new -
    Divorce Bells. It's a Pleasure.

This smut has provoked a revolt even among notable figures in the film world. Welford Beaton, editor of the Hollywood Spectator (whose technical opinion is valued so highly that Cecil De Mille wrote the preface to his Know Your Movies), hurls this ultimatum at the producers: "The other day I was watching with keen appreciation of its many artistic qualities The Easiest Way, Constance Bennett's starring vehicle, produced by Metro. For the second time in my life there was an exact moment when the point of revulsion was reached. I had had enough of sex. I want no more of it in my screen entertainment. ... The makers of our screen entertainment may continue to earn dividends by selling the immorality of women, but no longer can they sell it to me. I serve notice that every sex picture that I review from now on is going to be estimated for what it is— a filthy thing manufactured by business men."

Jurists and social workers among the delinquents have endorsed this indictment because of the sophistication of sin and the emotional debauches which many pictures show. Judge Frank Taylor of New York City charges: "At the movies the young see things they never should be allowed even to hear or think about. Under such conditions the downfall of young girls is not remote." Mrs. Margaret Eggleston, who has had more than twenty years' experience with adolescent girls in the city of Chicago, asserts: "One is almost staggered by what is seen when one looks into the movie, with its false ideas and its love-making of our young people. The thrilling pictures of scenes of love create an unwholesome atmosphere." Attorney Timothy D. Hurley, chairman of the Chicago Censorship Committee, told the aldermen of that city: "From the movies children of twelve years have learned more of birth, conception, and marriage than you and I knew when we were twenty... Marriage is scoffed at and lampooned." Again, Dr. F. O. Holt, president of the Wisconsin Teachers' Association, warns: "The root of all present-day evil among younger people lies at the doorstep of the movie-house. Here begins, at too early an age, the 'love chase.'"

The most serious incrimination of the motion-pictures' attack on marriage and morality comes from the lips of a large group of young witnesses interrogated in the investigations of the Payne Committee. In Movies, Delinquency, and Crime Blumer and Hauser have reproduced the verbatim statements of young people in the various social strata from delinquency to campus life. The language is often such that it cannot be produced here; but the contents of these confessions show that in definite instances motion-pictures are a stimulus to sex sins.

Altogether Dr. Blumer found that 50 per cent of the high school students embraced in his investigation took their ideas of physical love from the picture theaters; that there was a widespread imitation of the screen stars, not only in dress and adornment, but also in what he calls "the love technique"; that, rightly or wrongly, inmates of corrective institutions attribute stimulated cravings to motion-picture performances; and that in general this "molding by movies" and the increase of movie-made criminals constitute one of the most acute problems in this generation.

In all fairness to the industry let it be clearly stated that particularly in the last two years noteworthy advances have been made. The work of the Better Films Councils in the larger cities has not been in vain, and the producers have learned that high artistry in clean pictures brings the richest returns. Yet P. S. Harrison, editor of the Harrison's Reports, reviewing the 410 feature plays released during the first eleven months of 1937, declared that "I have found that 154 of these were unsuitable for showing either to children or to adolescents or to both." Thus, 37 1/2 per cent of the films examined were "of the type that might put the wrong ideas into the minds of young folk."

#### THE CHALLENGE OF A CRISIS

The editor of the Bookman, commenting on screen morality, concludes an editorial with this pessimistic surrender: "The screen shows it all — all it dares — the shoddy and shabby habiliments of life as it is lived by the movie stars and directors. What is the answer? There is none."

This resignation to defeat is not altogether exaggerated. The newspapers, which should be the coguardians of public morality, have failed dismally in stemming the rush of immorality; for they have often sold their editorial independence for a pottage of motion picture advertisements. The State Legislatures and city councils, which are called upon to preserve the morals of their constituency, are sometimes so passive that no action hostile to the Hollywood interests is passed or even seriously contemplated. Churches have often assumed a close-the-eye, say-nothing policy. Many homes, where parents have the sacred charge of guarding the souls of their children, are altogether too indifferent to these vital issues.

There can be no hope of improvement without a real awakening to this assault on decency with its subsequent softening of American morals. This awakening must, first of all, be a matter of personal conviction and express itself in a rigid boycott of every meretricious picture. The only argument that registers any effective force with the producers is a slump in box-office receipts. Motion-picture Herald, a trade paper devoted to the interests of theater-owners, stated that the national film attendance fell off about 12 per cent weekly during the first six weeks of the boycott which was waged by the Roman Catholic Church and the coordinated protest of Protestant groups. But a boycott will be only a flash in the pan unless it is systematized and perpetuated without compromise. Otherwise it will prove but a passing gesture, and the devil that has been banished will return with seven others, and we shall witness a more lurid reign of pornography than the worst we have yet beheld.

Young men and women of the Church whose lives have been deepened by religious training and spiritual conviction should have insight and discernment enough to remind themselves that they cannot expect any support for a clean, straightforward life from tainted contacts with the sins of the cinema. Because the responsibilities for tomorrow must be assumed largely by the rising generation in the Church of today, our appeal is directed particularly to the younger members of the Church and asks them, first of all, to pledge themselves with a high resolve never knowingly to attend any picture. which militates against Christian principle or character.

In order to give effectual power-to this resolution, it may be necessary to spread information, so that young people are in a position to judge the character of the picture. Perhaps the time has come when the Church should consider establishing a board of appraisal where pictures could be previewed and classified and the resultant criticism made available in church-papers and special bulletins. The thoughtful supervision that we extend to printed material in our book reviews should certainly be extended to a form of entertainment which has a far wider scope and effect in the minds of the masses than the latest books. Unfortunately certain basic difficulties present themselves. A review of this kind may be interpreted as an official urge to attend; the supplementary pic-tures, usually not advertised, may be outrageous; and the cloak of a decent picture may be used to cover a hundred other indecencies. In the circles of my Church the Cresset has well blazed the trail with reviews of outstanding films.

The Church cannot escape its responsibilities in this respect. If we cry out against sins in general, we must specifically denounce immoral pictures in particular; and to supplement these detailed warnings, church societies should adopt resolutions condemning all sex pictures and crime films. Copies of resolutions should be sent to the local press and to Mr. Hays's board. If it is objected that protests will be of no avail, we must remember that Christian character calls for protest regardless of consequences. Besides, an outright warning from 10,000, 50,000, or 100,000 organizations throughout the country could not remain unanswered.

Furthermore, we should not hesitate to join and endorse civic organizations dedicated to the removal of motion-picture filth. We have duties not only as Christians, but also as American citizens; and wherever organizations without objectionable features work for a sane, but effective censorship, the regulation of juvenile atten-dance, and other commendable objectives, Christians should lend the weight of their influence and cooperation. Our attitude must not be altogether negative. We ought to recognize the good films and register our approval, particularly through such organizations as the Better Films Bureaus. Through these agencies we can encourage the showing of better pictures and ban "bootleg" films, imported sex-pictures, and other pernicious productions against which the industry itself protests.

It is a crucial issue, this commercialized immorality that sweeps almost unchallenged over the nation and that, even as these lines are written, is sowing the seeds of infidelity, marital incon-stancy, and free love in the receptive soil of young American minds. To choke off its growth and to remove this menace from the very doors of the nation's homes, we need the cooperation and the support of our best minds, the watchful attitude of our legislatures, the enlisted zeal of Christian youth, and particularly the fervent prayers of Christian faith. Nothing short of this can check the rampant march to domestic debacle.

### HAZARDS OF THE NEW AGE

Flee ... youthful lusts - 2 Tim. 2:22

There are those — and their number is legion — who hold that, with few exceptions, modern young people, including those in the Church, are on the down grade. These critics compare the "good old days" with the unrestrained present and insist that today's youth has reached the lowest depths of immorality.

Students of history frown at these unqualified claims; for the past is often englamored because it lies at such distance that its faults, glossed over too readily, are not subject to intimate scrutiny. The very sins catalogued in the indictment of modern youth are often ironically the same misdemeanors for which the young people a complacent eye on that amazing immorality which surrounds us on all sides; but it would be traitorous to refuse to enter the lists in behalf of the splendid army of young Christian warriors who have not bowed before the Baals of lust.

Besides, carping denunciation is a thin, futile device. Instead our Christian youth needs constant encouragement. Within my own Church I know that young people are showing an increasingly intelligent interest in the study of the Bible. Missionary interest and personal work have never been so strong and systematic as now. Present charitable efforts are almost above comparison with the past. Many of our young men and young women are giving new evidence of a high-souled conviction.

#### PERILS OF THE NEW FREEDOM

Yet we are face to face with problems in our moral life which are far more forbidding than the worst of yesterday. The battalions of lust marshaled against the average young man or woman today are more insidious than ever before. The temptations which they meet on the road to happy marriage are more frequent and deceptive than those besetting previous generations.

The hazards of this swift-moving generation may well be typified by the automobile. This remarkable invention has emphasized moral problems which did not disturb the last century. In 1906, when the automotive industry was in its awkward infancy, the Hearst newspapers throughout the land featured an editorial under the title: "The Automobile will Make Us More Human." In this prophecy, the style of which bears the earmarks of Arthur Brisbane's earlier efforts, the horseless carriage is greeted as a humanizing element, and the claim is made that "with the advent of the automobile and the disappearance of horses ... men ... dealing with machinery will soon become more nearly human than they are at present."

That prediction now stands revealed in its own folly. The most critical issue provoked by the automobile is not the appalling list of those who are killed and maimed in motor accidents (during one decade six times as many Americans were killed in motor casualties as in all the battles of the World War, and fifty times as many injured). More serious is the ruthless slaughter of youthful morals. The machine provides a welcome exit from overcrowded or uncongenial homes, a complete escape from chaperonage, and too much privacy. Under our free and easy conventions the parked car presents a new menace, perhaps one of the greatest in the history of youth morals. While the new freedom has unquestionably brought many clean, frank, and commendable advances, it has also strengthened the regiments of ruin confronting youth in the conflict between the spirit and the flesh. The pointed appeal of the hour must be the same as St. Paul's earnest admonition to Timothy: "Flee ... youthful lusts" (2 Tim. 2:22); but we must realize that a twentieth-century commentary on these words may reveal forces just as disastrous as the worst of those against which Timothy had to contend in the degeneracy of surrounding paganism.

#### DEMORALIZING LEISURE

Whatever else our age may lack, it has more leisure than any generation before us has enjoyed. The five-day week, consistently denounced until recent years, is widely adopted in American industrial life. Insistent voices demand a four-day week. Hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the land are grateful for a schedule of even three full working-days. Repeatedly we hear of projects like that of H. G. Wells, who a few years ago proposed a twelve-day week with eight days of continuous labor and four of continuous holiday.

In addition, the length of the work-day has been abbreviated from its total of twelve or fourteen hours. Organized labor has been victorious in its efforts to establish an eight-hour day. Yet this, too, is being cut to seven and six hours in the industrial emergency. And the end is not in sight. Max G. Winkel, labor economist, claims in the Federationist, the American Federation of Labor magazine, that the four-hour work-day for all workers will soon be effected.

According to exhibit charts prepared by labor leaders, there has been a reduction in the working-week from eighty-four hours in 1840 to fifty hours in 1930 and a threefold increase in the amount of leisure during the same period. In the critical years since 1930 the working-week has been still further reduced, frequently to forty hours — a drop of ten hours in fewer than ten years. We have realized at least a part of M. Ilin's prediction in the New Russid's Primer, p. 16: "The more machines we have, the easier will be the work, the shorter will be the working-day, the lighter and happier will be the lives of all."

There is reason to question the thesis that the new leisure will produce more happiness. So apprehensive are public leaders and social strategists of the far-reaching problems provoked by our 10,000,000 unemployed and the universal reduction of working-hours that they have projected detailed programs for the absorption of spare time. A large literature on leisure activities has sprung up, testifying to wide research.

Unless constructively employed, however, this overflow of extra hours will not only kill time, but will also massacre morals. In a general way, we are told, most of American spare time is spent at the movies, at card tables, in an automobile, or before a radio. A New York University authority estimates that Americans spend 1,500,000 hours daily before the radio, that one eighth of our population attends the movies each day, and that unnumbered hours are wasted "in aimless puttering or in aimless reading." There are factors in this time distribution which may precipitate grave moral hazards. At the end of November, 1934, Government workers occupied with a check-up on the amusement business of our country reported that in 1933 people of the United States spent $519,497,000 on amusements. Seventy-eight per cent of the total went for motion-pictures. Slightly less than 11 per cent was paid for the radio. Restricting the field of inquiry to younger people, Leisure, the Columbia University's 1934 study on these new prob-lems, reports recreational tendencies that consistently take young people away from their homes during their leisure. An investigation embracing the activities of 796 high-school students in Westchester County found that "in the overwhelming majority of these . .. cases some other place than home was the scene of the pleasant occasion reported. Only 5 per cent of the boys and 17 per cent of the girls had their 'best time' at home" (p. 112).

Well may we ask whether the number of extra hours afforded by the increase of unemployment and the reduction of the working schedule will be wisely invested by our young people or heedlessly squandered on trivialities and dangerous activities. Remember, the approach of temptation is never easier than in unoccupied moments. The appeals of attractive sin can linger longer in the vacuum of leisure than in the full program of a busy life. It is the idle hour that Satan preempts for private sins, the vacant moments that he usurps for his antipurity program.

How disastrously leisure may influence family life is portrayed with clear-cut lines in the marital histories of the idle rich. If the actual causes for Reno divorces (not the fictitious, collusive reasons advanced in mockery of justice) could be tabulated, it would be found that the sins of unfaithfulness flourish with unusual force in the empty lives of men and women who refuse life's serious obligations. Again, a most treacherous element in many modern marriages is the want of occupation on the part of many young wives. They regard children as cumbersome, and household duties as degrading, irksome. They are overtaken by the ennui that soon surrounds them in the monotony of an efficiency apartment. With time heavy on their hands, they often find it an easy step from domestic loafing to serious complications. No wonder that the Bible protests, in words of modern ring, against women who "learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not." (1 Tim. 5:13.)

However, the same consequences of undirected time reappear in unmarried lives and in careers that are not handicapped by wealth. The conquests of immorality are not gained during busy working-hours, in the eager flurries of industry; the pull of dawdling pleasures is strongest between the schedules of our daily duties. Then it is, in these tedious, lackadaisical hours, that the border-line literature makes its well-timed appeal. The salacious motion-picture is never more attractive than in this maudlin inactivity, the invitation to join in some dangerous pastimes never so alluring as during the unoccupied hours.

It follows, then, that the achieving life must have a program for this new leisure which can save the gold-dust of time. While hours as well as dollars must be budgeted, every schedule of youthful activity must leave full allowance for recreation, social pleasures, amusements. This is an integral part in the make-up of all normal young people. Young men and young women who seclude themselves and shun healthy pastimes are usually not characterized by any superior chastity. There are exceptions of course, but as a rule the practical experiences of life leads us to question the virtues of the abnormal. So concerned is the Church about providing clean, healthy outlets for recreation that, although this is not an essential part of its work, it offers many facilities for the social life. Those who maintain associations with their fellow-Christians and enjoy happy hours in the clean environment of Christian homes will know why the preacher of the Old Testament exhorts: "Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth." (Eccl. 11:9.)

A well-planned life will also provide for sports and physical exercise. These temples of the living God we call our bodies must be kept in constant repair, and those who take time for vigorous, robust play in the open air know that physical practice, always in moderation, may often help to strengthen not only the body, but indirectly also the character. Hiking and running, swimming and riding, skating and skiing, tennis and golf, baseball and basket-ball, — these and the many other forms of organized outdoor and indoor play act as safety-valves and consume some of the excess energy which, if not released in this way, may burst other bounds of restraint. While the Romans exaggerated, ruling that a healthy mind is found only in a healthy body, this principle belongs in every youthful program of purity.

The assets of leisure also offer generous cultural opportunities. In this land of more than 10,000 libraries we have books by the millions that can entertain, inform, and elevate. All these can be had for the asking. In our unequaled system of adult education thousands of evening schools and correspondence courses present the open door to mental improvement. With these loftier heights beckoning, who can be content with the lower levels of cheap, slapstick entertainment?

No time budget would be complete without an ample allowance for church-work. These are critical years of transition, in which the nation is being catapulted into a new age. The danger is imminent that the Church will fail to meet its responsibility unless it is reenforced by the full vigor of its membership. In no aspect of our lives is the Biblical promise so clearly illustrated: "He which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully" (2 Cor. 9:16) as in the personal blessings that accompany our efforts in behalf of the Kingdom. Young people who take an active part in the congregational life, who, mission-minded, find time to speak to others concerning their hope and faith, who courageously visit the unchurched and invite them to attend church — these alert disciples who help to carry out the programs of applied Christianity by visiting the poor, the suffering, the imprisoned, not only experience the joy of being "coworkers with God," but unconsciously build up a moral reserve. All who testify for Christ work side by side with their Lord. In the hour of trial and temptation He will stand by their side, and the consciousness of His abiding presence will be a divine deterrent from sin.

#### FATAL FRIENDSHIPS

In many slaughter-houses an old bull is employed in the notorious capacity which has earned for him the name "the Hypocrite." Whenever a shipment of steers arrives, he stands at the foot of the runway, with two or three pieces of hay protruding from the corner of his mouth. The new arrivals, raw from the prairies, approach him; and as he shuffles along indifferently toward the door of the slaughter-house, the other steers, sensing the leadership of this sophisticated bovine, follow him until they finally reach the killing-pens. But when the gates of these pens are closed, the old is never found among those present. He has simply lost himself in the crowd and returned to the safety zone to await the arrival of other country cousins, who through similar perfidy are introduced to the beginning of their end. In East St. Louis an old goat, appropriately named "Judas," decoyed 260,000 sheep into the hands of the killers in a single year. The newspapers recorded the death of an old ram in Chicago which in ten years of similar activity had led more than 7,000,000 sheep to their slaughter.

We find evidence of parallel tragedy in the friendships of young people. John Graham, Chicago packer, wrote to his son at Harvard: "I never saw a dozen boys together where there was not an old hypocrite steer among them." There is indeed a morbid fascination in evil when it is embodied in attractive and friendly persons; and it is to the treachery of these false friendships that some young people today must ascribe part of their surrender to impurity.

Many young men and women have formed friendships which have not only ruined their reputations but have also weakened their ideals and reduced their capacity for happy marriage. The Bible tells us: "Evil communications corrupt good manners" (1 Cor. 15:33), and experience assures us that our attitudes are often shaped by the influence of those with whom we associate.

The daughters in our last-century families stayed at home and led a secluded, intimately supervised existence, into which few but carefully selected friends entered. Today the struggle to maintain the tamily and a new conception of woman's place in the world about us have cooperated to draw our young women into mercantile or industrial employment, where the ancient wall of reserve is broken down. Complicated problems have arisen for girls who work in offices and factories. How often does it not happen that a splendid Christian girl, earning her living and supporting her family, is thrown together with fellow-workers, department heads, executives, and officials who have no principles of decency in their lives and no fear of God in their hearts! And how often have not friendships arisen from this association that have poisoned hearts, stifled con-sciences, and condemned the noble memories of Church and home!

Or take the young men who have pledged themselves to their Savior and then have gone out to the highways of the world. In a hundred different contacts they make the acquaintance of many congenial associates with attractive appearances, persuasive words, enticing plans; and before long the same young men once moved by an ardent appreciation of their Church begin to neglect their parents and their home and run to ruin amid the flattery of companions who pat them on their shoulder at every step they take away from their Church. Criminal experts who have analyzed the causes that lead young people to lawlessness have repeatedly stated that evil associations are powerful factors in the promotion of criminality.

It will be strengthening for us to recall the frustrated assault on the morals of a young Hebrew slave that occurred four thousand years ago in ancient Egypt, Joseph's absolute rejection of evil as he fled from the invitation of lust. While it was no usual, everyday allurement into which that young man was intrigued by the scheming adulteress, his challenging answer "How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God" (Gen. 39:9) demonstrates the only effective way of counteracting temptations offered by close contacts.

Among the many species of trees characteristic of Florida is the strangling-fig, related to the commercial fig, the rubber-tree, and the Oriental banyan. Its growth starts in a precarious manner when its seed is dropped among the limbs of a tree. As it germinates, it sends its roots downward; and as these roots branch and enlarge, the tree that sheltered the first seed is slowly strangled. Eventually all traces of it disappear. The influences of some social sets are often not dissimilar. Because coaxing companions have all too frequently lured young people into situations where the requirements of purity and clean living have been contemptuously dis-regarded, it should be a matter of serious concern to ask intro-spectively, "Are my friends helping me?" and to plead for the courage to resist all hostility masquerading under the guise of intimate acquaintance.

The obvious antiseptic against that poison is the cultivation of true and tried friends. Damon and Pythias may live only in the pages of mythology, but the warm-hearted fellowship between David and Jonathan can be perpetuated into the reality of our modern lives through the Spirit of Him who called us His friends. Kipling exclaims: "Thank God for a trusty chum!" If you gain the friendship of one whom you can respect and admire, a confidant whose attitudes and actions will stimulate and uplift and lead you along the pleasant and profitable paths of life, you have a treasure for which, in truth, you should fervently thank your God.

#### DROOPING OFFICE ETHICS

In a single week two letters, one from a young man and the other from a young woman, came to my desk from different parts of the country. With varied detail and background, both letters dealt with essentially the same problem — the moral standards of business, the ethics of the modern office. Both communications were frank in deploring certain tendencies which, they inferred, were by no means exceptional.

The one letter from a Pittsburgh young man, who states: "I have worked for three large corporations, and the conditions have been the same in all," asks: "Why do not the executives of our large corporations show better examples of living to their employees? At present I am employed in a large plant which has a get-together meeting once a month, the general superintendent and superintendents of different departments and employees attending. Generally the meeting is addressed by one or several executives. I was present at one of these meetings and was shocked at the language and profanity of the vilest type. In spite of this the speaker was profusely applauded, and after the speech drinking and gambling were the high spots.

"At another plant the superintendent was looking for a young man to take charge of a group of young men, and the first question he asked was, 'Can you swear?' and the young man immediately demonstrated his ability to use vile language. He got the job.

"I am closely associated in office work with both Protestants and Catholics, and they continually speak of gambling and use profane language, following the example of their superiors. I try to dissuade them, but they laugh it off.

"These plants make extensive drives on safety and are covered with posters cautioning employees against danger, but they dis regard the more important safety of the soul."

The young woman's letter states: "I work in a large office, where there are six girls and eighteen salesmen. Having been reared in a refined, Christian home and actively connected with the work of the young people of our church for a half dozen years, I had little contact with the seamy side of life before I was employed in a big business office.

"Even though the personnel knows that the chief dismisses his employees when he hears of their being involved in any immoral relationships, almost every salesman in our office (and most of them are married) asks me to go on questionable 'dates,' to hotels for a private dinner, etc. They know it is my policy always to reject their proposals, and I have never accepted; but what can a girl do? I am the sole support of my widowed another.

"Topics of a very personal concern which would embarrass me to mention are broached with too much freedom and to the annoyance of any well-bred person.

"I don't make overtures to men, yet it seems that I have more than my share of worries because of improper suggestions, which certainly have no place in life, much less in a business office. My friends in other large offices tell me of similar distressing conditions.

"The other day, in reply to my refusal, a salesman said, 'You can't make me believe you are as virtuous as all that. Girls like that faded out with the last generation!' I told him that I knew fifty of my friends, single young women, who are Christians and who believe in living their religion as much as I do. He told me it was too beautiful to imagine, — and yet he and his kind have. the nerve to make the same disgusting proposals over and over again. What in the world should a girl do? I've tried to get another job but cannot find one, and my mother and I need my income of eighty dollars a month."

The obvious solution to the problems contained in these letters would be the escape from these distasteful and dangerous surroundings offered by other positions. But work is not plentiful today, with millions unemployed, and for most of our readers a struggle for livelihood is real and earnest. To give up a position blindly and without another source of income might seem to provoke a major calamity. And because it is sometimes impossible to avoid that extreme, it will be well to call attention to some basic principles.

First of all give your work your undivided attention, your best thought, your full energy. Every normal and reliable concern appreciates good work and will hesitate to lose the services of employees who, having intelligence and initiative, apply themselves faithfully to their tasks.

Be pleasant, courteous to the office personnel, but keep relations impersonal and on a business basis! If you tend strictly to your work, you will usually find that your attitudes are respected.

Stop all approaches to familiarity at the outset! Do not let complications develop, thinking that you can correct them later on! Resist the beginnings!

Never make appointments with strangers, casual business acquaintances, and others whose family and connections are unknown to you! The salesman who invites you for an evening's entertainment may be a married man.

Watch yourself particularly at office parties and resist every questionable proposal! We are told by business men that these business-social functions, particularly in connection with holidays and anniversaries, often degenerate into drinking-bouts, and many a girl who detests liquor takes her share just to avoid being classed as a prude.

Never hesitate to acknowledge your church-membership or your devotion to your Savior! Christ's admonition "Whosoever shall confess Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father which is in heaven" holds for offices, stores, factories, shops. Once it is known that you take your religion seriously, you will usually find at least a silent respect. It is said of Evangeline Booth that no matter where she went among the lowest and most depraved of men, her Salvation Army uniform and her service to Christ which it represented brought her respect and protection. Similar consideration will be extended to you if you show the same loyalty to Christ.

Don't listen to profanity, blasphemy, or questionable stories without protest. When the name of God is misused, the Church attacked, the Bible ridiculed, decency flaunted, it will take an unusually corrupt mind to continue against your expressed dis-approval. But if your protest is unheeded, you must speak with firmness and finality. You cannot remain quiet while the holy "name which is above every name" is abused. Your silence gives not only consent but also endorsement to filthy language and stories. You certainly would not listen to scurrilous insults against your father. How, then, can you sit by, lips sealed, when your heavenly Father is reviled?

If your reasonable requests are not heeded (and a fanatical or emotional attitude will help but little) and your work constantly imposes moral hazards, leads you into daily temptation, no other course remains than to seek new employment. We confidently believe that our heavenly Counselor will guide you with particular blessing because of this decision. Often those who have incurred temporary loss through their loyalty to Christ have been led to far greater material gains.

#### INTEMPERANCE

A new purity problem has been accentuated since the repeal of national prohibition. Those who believe that the rescinding of the Eighteenth Amendment will solve the liquor problem are optimists of first rank. For while prohibition had its evils and helped create a spirit of corruption and contempt for the law, the new era will not be a golden age of innocence. Young people who day after day are affronted with towering displays of whisky and gin, wine and champagne, crême de menthe and exotic liqueur, will not remain untouched by these allurements. With liquor flowing in streams and cocktails dispensed in cafeterias, those who cannot visualize dangers must be short-sighted idealists, unconscious of the increase in post-repeal drunkenness.

No big business in the United States has grown with the same remarkable strides that the liquor industry has shown since the repeal of prohibition. Today we have about 500,000 outlets for the sale of alcoholic beverages that are under license of Government protection. In other words, we have one tavern, restaurant, or cocktail bar for approximately every 260 inhabitants of the nation! In some communities the ratio reveals two taverns to every church, four times as many taverns as commercial places of amuse-ment. During 1935 the 30,000,000 families in our country averaged an outlay of $91.61 for liquor, a figure much larger than the average family's contribution to the kingdom of God. Nor have we reached the saturation point. In a lavish advertising campaign the young people who grew up in an era of prohibition are being attracted to the "smooth swallow" and the "mellow taste." The mode of the day has instituted the cocktail hour and the cocktail party. The screen mirrors the drinking scenes that crowd into society life. As the pendulum swings back from the mistaken rigidity of pro-hibition, it oscillates toward another extreme, an increasing disregard of the requirements imposed by the strict demands of temperance. We now have more drinking than ever before.

Our newspapers abound in head-lines like this: "Arrests for "drunken driving' in the city of Washington, D.C., during 1935 broke all records for the 17-to-22-year-old group." The increase of drunkenness among motorists of Minnesota is creating "an appalling situation" in the opinion of Gil Carmichael, director of the Minnesota State Drivers' Bureau. Behind many of the gruesome accidents that clutter the week-end issues of our newspapers and bring sudden death, crippled lives, and destroyed hopes is the bleary eye, the befuddled mind, the unsteady hand of a drunken driver.

Youthful health has also been assailed by overindulgence in alcoholics. A statement of the Northwestern National Life Insurance Company declares that "indulgence in alcohol shows an increase of 149 per cent as a cause of uninsurability among men and women under thirty. ... For all ages the increase in rejections involving alcoholic excesses is 25 per cent since the prerepeal days of 1931—1932."

One of the emphasized tragedies in recent years is that the drinking wife has become a major social problem. This is the authoritative opinion of Martin Nelson, secretary of the Keeley Institute at Dwight, Illinois, internationally known sanitarium which specializes in curing habitual drinkers. The growth in the number of women trying to rid themselves of this habit at Keeley Institute has been twice as large proportionately as that of the men. Mr. Nelson asserts: "Prohibition transferred drinking from the bar-room to the living-room, and wives learned to drink. Repeal returned drinking to the bar-room, and the wives followed their husbands there. Today public complacency about women drinking at bars is making the problem of the woman inebriate tragically serious." Seventy-four per cent of the patients at Keeley on January 1, 1939, were housewives.

While it is difficult to formulate a statement on the relation of alcohol and purity that will be regarded dispassionately (since the most objective utterances will be subjected to bitter attack, either by the dripping "wets" or the arid "drys"), even controversy must concede two fundamental facts. One of these foundation truths declares: The Bible in both the Old and New Testaments, far from outlawing alcoholics, permits the consumption of wine and strong drink, and this not only for medicinal purposes, but also for the food value, the refreshment, and the cheer which they offer. To contradict these Scriptural assertions, to declare them out of force in our twentieth-century civilization, as prohibition propagandists do, may ultimately weaken the authority of the entire Bible.

When the Scriptures say: "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts" (Prov. 31:6) or: "Wine... maketh glad the heart of man" (Ps. 104:15) or once more: "Go thy way; eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart" (Eccl. 9:7), it declares itself in harmony with the testimony of impartial scientific investigators, who have classified the effect of alcohol on the emotions. In the comprehensive work entitled Alcohol and Men (edited by Haven Emerson of Columbia University, with associate editors from Harvard, Yale, Columbia, the Rockefeller Institute, and with contributors from these schools as well as also from New York University, Stanford University, Cornell University, Carnegie In-stitute, Johns Hopkins Hospital, life insurance companies, State hygienic departments, — a group representative of the best, unbiased American thought), we read the following (p. 263; quoted with permission of the publishers, The Macmillan Company) : "Alcohol ...abolishes mental tension, disguises difficulties, changes the mood from a disagreeable, self-centered state to sociable friendliness. The peculiar charm of alcohol lies in the sense of careless well-being and bodily and mental comfort which it creates." - In all this, as long as moderation prevails, there is nothing reprehensible according to the generous standards of the Bible.

As a second basic observation it may be said that the utterances of the Scriptures warn emphatically against the dangers lurking in alcoholic stimulants. Never before in debates on liquor have so many references been made to the wedding of Cana as in the eras of prohibition and repeal. Never before have the words of friendly advice which St. Paul offers Timothy, suggesting that he take a little wine for his stomach's sake, been given the overemphasis which recent years have brought. This argumentation becomes unfair when no attention is accorded the many passages which picture the dangers of hard liquor in sharp, unmistakable language. The Bible repeatedly shows the terrifying calamities skulking in the wake of intemperance, and emphatically warns against overindulgence. How else can we understand Solomon's questions and answers: "Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath babbling? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to seek mixed wine. Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder" (Prov. 23:29-32).

When the sage of the Old Testament discusses the connection between liquor and lust, he says of the wine-bibber: "Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things" (Prov. 23:33). This is the ancient statement of a modern pathological truth. Dr. Walter R. Miles, professor of experimental psychology at Yale (I.c.), says: "The increase in the tendency to sex offenses which alcohol induces has been noted from time immemorial, and profane love has naturally been a prominent theme in the songs of Bacchus." He shows the close association between commercial vice and the bar and says that this "gives practical recognition of the psychological connection between inebriation and sex expression." He adds: "When alcohol is circulating freely in the nervous system, the censor, ... whose responsibility it is to restrain or divert inappropriate sexual impulses, is off guard. Under these conditions stimuli that would ordinarily claim but little attention or be quickly put aside easily arouse emotion and emotional expression." And he concludes by submitting scientific claims to the effect that alcohol has a particularly weakening effect on the self-control of young women.

Subsequent investigation by Dr. Emerson, published in Alcohol, Its Effects on Man, provoked these statements (pp. 82 and 83) : "The most successful artificial or drug excitant to sexual excess is alcohol... Alcohol in moderate amounts suffices commonly to lower self-restraint and self-control in situations of sex temptation, so that exposure to the hazards of sexual diseases is undertaken thoughtlessly and without care of the consequences. ... Sexual irresponsibility is a not uncommon result of the unrestricted use of alcohol in mixed company."

John W. Churchman, in Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Vol. 7, p. 260, writes: "Alcohol paralyzes the inhibitions, renders the physical urges more obvious, disarms the critical faculty, breaks down reasonableness and prudence, blurs fineness of perception and taste, without necessarily creating the state socially recognized as intoxication. Alcohol is the best salesman and procurer known and is a constant and essential stock in trade for the promotion of prostitution."

Equally decisive testimony comes to us from the other side of the Atlantic. In the report of the Royal Commission to Investigate the Drink Problem a section entitled "A Review of the Effects of Alcohol on Man" (London, 1931) gives this official verdict (p. 119) : "Alcohol certainly reduces sexual self-control and makes continence more difficult, and at the same time it weakens judgment, so that the dangers of promiscuity are ignored. It would be difficult to overestimate the influence of alcohol in morals or its role in the spread of venereal disease. Its disturbing effect on the sex instinct is obvious, apart from any question of gross immorality; it is seen in the region of thought and of imagination. When it was the custom for men to drink much wine at dinner parties, the ladies were expected to retire early from the table." Consequently the danger of marriage with a husband addicted to alcohol must not be minimized. Dr. Edward A. Strecker and Dr. Francis T. Cham-bers, in Alcohol, One Man's Meat (p. 108), warn pointedly: "Wo-men who marry inebriate lovers with the objective of reforming them usually fail conspicuously." (Quoted with the publishers' permission.)

These official statements of recognized medical authorities, as far as I know, have never been successfully contested. In innumerable instances it has been the surreptitious flask, the treacherous background of the roadhouse, the highway tavern, and the cocktail parties that paved the way to the sacrifice of purity.

The conclusion, then, suggests itself that the immoderate indulgence in alcoholics has been one of the most formidable factors in establishing a reign of easy morals among a certain class of young people. Much depends upon the personal realization of this fact by our Christian youth. With the new privileges accorded by both the law of God and the law of man, the ideal of temperance remains unchanged. Repeal should not imply any necessity or advisability of departing from a policy of strict sobriety. I feel personally that the young man or young woman who, without fanaticism and with the proper understanding of the Biblical attitude on this question, decides to adopt a standard of strict abstinence will not sacrifice anything essential to life's happiness. For those who may be disturbed by their own inability to stop at the proper time there is but one rule: "Hands off alcohol!" While the Church dare not drop to the extremes of bigotry which would take a glass of beer away from the working-man or shudder with sanctimonious disdain at the mention of wine, it must never lull itself into any coma of unconcern which neglects to exalt temperance and to warn its youth against the seduction that lurks in strong drink. Even Plato (Laws, 2:9) urged that wine should be illegal for all young people until they were seventeen; for he insisted that "without such a law there would be the imminent danger that our youth would fall victims to degeneracy." The Apostle's caution: "Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess" (Eph. 5:18) should not be restricted in its application to actual intoxication. Dr. T. B. Hyslop, in the Encyclopedia Medica (sub "General Paralysis"), declares: "Intemperance does not necessarily mean only obvious and palpable drunkenness. From the very moment in which alcohol has disturbed the healthy exercise of the mental faculties or has impaired the moral sense by unduly exciting the animal passions, ... from that moment there has been guilt of intemperance."

When another recent heiress-royalty wedding went wrong, the bride, who deserted her titled husband five days after the ceremony, explained her hasty acceptance of his proposal (after only two weeks' acquaintance) with the alibi: "We had been dining, and I had taken wine. I am not used to it." Even when husband and wife are "used to it," alcoholics will often produce similarly disruptive con-sequences. We should heed well the words of that eminent authority Dr. Howard A. Kelly of Johns Hopkins University, who testifies (The Alcoholic Problem in Every-day Life, Senate Document 5,566, p. 123): "As a citizen... I observe that alcohol has destroyed the happiness and the lives of relatives, friends, and acquaintances... I have seen that it robs the home of peace; it puts a barrier between husband and wife and kills all true parental tenderness, throwing the children back into the world for that moral training a father and a mother are alone fitted by nature to give. It is at the bottom of most crime, domestic infelicity, poverty, seductions."

What alcohol can do to young lives is graphically illustrated by the drunken episodes in the life of Alexander the Great, often neglected by modern readers. At the age of twenty-six Alexander had held uncontested sway of all Western Asia. With vast wealth and undisputed power and no more worlds left to conquer, he gave himself up to a life of sadistic debauch. In his drunken orgies he put some of his most trusted officers to death. One of his biographers gives this picture of his bacchanalian carousals and his ignoble end: "Alexander not only indulged in vice himself but also encouraged others to follow his evil example. He would offer prizes at his banquets to those who could drink the most, thus causing forty deaths at one of his entertainments. ... On one occasion he had spent a whole night in drinking and carousing, and then some of the guests proposed that they should begin a second banquet instead of retiring. Alexander, half intoxicated, agreed. There were twenty present at this new feast. Alexander, to show them how much he was able to drink, pledged each one separately and then all together. There was a very large cup, called the bowl of Hercules, which he now called for, and having filled it to the brim, he drank it off and again filled the huge bowl and again drank the entire contents. His strength soon failed him, and he sank to the floor. They bore him away to his apartment. A violent fever soon followed this terrible debauch, which his physicians tried in vain to allay. At last, finding he must die, he drew his signet ring from his finger; this was the token that he felt that all was over. He handed this ring to one of his friends, saying, "When I am gone, take my body to the temple of Jupiter Ammon and inter it there.'" So Alexander, the ruler of Asia Minor, died at thirty-two.

#### THE SUGGESTIVE DANCE

One of the most persistent assaults on the ideals of morality and marriage is captained by the immoral dance. Ask one hundred earnest evangelical clergymen for their opinion on the suggestive dance, and one hundred pastoral voices will unite in branding it as a most insidious opposition to their best efforts. If you think this type of clergymen biased or out of touch with modern trends, ask a group of experienced social workers for their verdict, and again many will agree that no single factor has led more girls to ruin than the temptations of the public dance-hall. Interview girls segregated in institutions of correction; ask them what has contributed to their delinquency, and with telltale frequency the dance-hall and the occurrences subsequent to the sensual dance will figure decisively in their answers.

Now, all this may sound bigoted and puritanical in this day of Terpsichore's rule in gilded pomp and lavish circumstance, when her devotees do honor to her in dance-palaces that recall the luxury of the Trianon or mimic the rococo of the most lavish Louis. It may appear futile to raise a dissonant voice; yet the fear of futility should never be a deterrent. The masses have committed many mob mistakes.

In surveying the dangerous influences of the modern dance, it should be admitted, as scientific observers have conceded, that dancing is a stimulus to certain physical impulses. The Medical Review of Reviews, which cannot be impugned on the charge of bias, declares: "There can scarcely be any doubt that dancing came about as an adjunct to sexual stimulation. As such it existed, undisguised among primitive peoples of antiquity. It still retains this original purpose among us today, but it is not avowed as such openly." Dr. A. H. Bigelow finds this consequence of dancing: "Sex stimulation may be consciously recognized by normal men, but probably is not identified as other than general excitement by most women."

Professional dancers, whose opinion is particularly noteworthy, have assailed the sensual dance on this score in outspoken criticism. Irene Castle, as quoted by the Associated Press, declares: "I'm horrified at the manner of dancing, not alone in New York but in the Central West. It is simply unspeakable. It is a shame and disgrace that police have to be retained by hotels to supervise dancing; yet that is what is being done nightly in New York." Dancing-master William P. Rivers says: "The modern dances are nothing but public petting parties." Raymond Duncan told the readers of the Detroit Times: "Modern dances are merely sensual exhibitions, devoid of taste. Many people no longer dance for the joy of dancing. They dance because it is an excuse for hugging each other in public."

Visitors from foreign parts stand aghast at the liberties licensed by some of our dances. Maude Taylor Sarvis, in the Christian Century (October 31, 1931), submits a quotation from a letter by a Chinese student who had just come to America to study: "Last night I went to first American dance. I got very great shock. In China, as you know, all students very much admire Western methods of courtship and free mingling of young people, so they can choose their own mates without interference of parents or middleman. But as I watched the young men and young ladies tightly hugging in one another's arms and moving about the room to distracting music playing loudly, I must feel very strongly that the psychology produced could not be in the least suitable for the state of mind in which to choose a life companion. For the first time I felt our Chinese method of arranging marriages is superior to American one."

It is not a delectable commentary on the American dance which our newspapers bring in these dispatches:

"Moscow: The American dances were forbidden today by the Soviet Supreme Council for Physical Education as unfit for Russia's proletariat youth. Dr. Semashko, commissar of health, denounced the dances as 'indecent products of the fat American bourgeoisie."

"Tokyo: American dances have aroused the local police. These dances are now barred in all except licensed dance-halls, and in the latter none of the American steps are allowed after ten o'clock. The police claimed the dances tended to be immoral."

This suggestiveness of the dance, so protruding that self-respecting Reds and Confucianists have mentally thrown up their hands in horror, is nowhere more evident than in the shocking infuence of the dance-hall, whether this be of the garish, blatant type or the select club with its private, restricted clientele. Particularly obnoxious are the roadhouses just outside the city limits. A United States Children's Bureau Bulletin after an investigation of dance-halls in twenty-five States calls these resorts "our greatest menace" and describes the dangers that lurk there, where everything prohibited in the city runs its unrestricted course. This does not exonerate the larger halls governed by municipal regulations, of course. A graphic picture of the moral hazards found in these breeding-places of impurity is presented in the Twenty-sixth Annual Report of the Committee of Fourteen, New York City, published on July 19, 1931. After showing that commercialized vice is "now greater in volume and more brazenly open" than formerly, the bulk of the survey, which predicts that conditions will get worse before they improve, deals with the chain dance-halls operated by a syndicate. The report claims: "This chain is rumored to have the protection of certain license inspectors and other employees of that department, certain plain-clothes policemen and -women, and a city magistrate. The magistrate was rumored to have an indirect financial interest. He has a consistent record of discharging defendants in dance-hall cases prosecuted by the police." Under this corruption these halls are described in the report as "acute moral hazards." "Dancing of the most lascivious type is permitted. There seems to be no supervision at all. What happens after liquor has flowed freely, as it regularly does?" There is no question as to the occurrences in the taxi dance hall or at the hostess dances, which doubtless approach the lowest level in the degeneration of the dance.

Listen to Bascom Johnson and Paul M. Kinsie, protesting in the Journal of Social Hygiene (December, 1933, p. 485): "Twenty or more years ago dance-halls were reputed to be 'recruiting grounds' for prostitution. The personal histories of many prostitutes testify to the demoralizing influences which were at work in these places.. Shortly after the war a new type of dance-hall was developed, which offered greater financial returns to operators. Unfortunately it likewise created a condition much more difficult to control and exceedingly more hazardous to the young people who sought a recreational outlet. The new type of dance-hall became known as the 'taxi dance' or 'dime jig' and gained almost instant popularity. Such places are aptly called taxi-dance halls because, instead of a general admission fee, ten cents is charged for each dance with the so-called instructresses or hostesses, who are provided by the management and work on a percentage basis.

"Since 1927 city after city has been invaded by taxi-dance halls. In the majority lewd, indecent, and sex-stimulating forms of dancing are the main attraction. At first a younger element made up the bulk of the patronage, but gradually older men were attracted and frequented these resorts in large numbers.

"The tremendous profits in this form of so-called recreation can be realized when it is known that the proprietor of a taxi dance hall in a Middle Western city was said to have made a net profit of $400,000 in eight months. A friend of his opened a similar resort in a near-by city, said to be financed on a 'shoe-string,' and paid off all indebtedness inside a month. He was described as 'now sitting pretty? The hostesses likewise profit, although they receive only five cents per dance from the management, and the majority of them are said to have earned from $75 to $100 per week. Naturally, lucrative employment of this kind attracted many young girls, especially during the early part of the depression period, and a large number of them were found to be small-town girls, who had migrated from home to the big cities in search of employment... The effect in most cases upon both hostesses and patrons cannot help but be demoralizing and degrading. Some of these places are known to be recruiting-grounds for procureres."

Some may contend that the cheap dancing-halls come under the condemnation which the more refined and fashionable amusement place escapes. But listen to Mrs. Nina C. Van Winkle, Washington, D.C., police-matron and president of the International Association of Police-women: "Visit a roof garden or cabaret. There you will see boys and girls drinking and dancing in a way to arouse thoroughly all the sexual impulses. By the time the dance is over many of the girls as well as the boys are drunk. Then you see them in their automobiles, driving out into the country, where there will be no interruption to anything they may do."

If the circle is drawn more closely and the protest is raised that at least the more selected dance socials are innocent, then hear Mrs. Henrietta Hunt, superintendent of the Springfield, Illinois, Redemption Home: "Dancing drags down more girls than anything else. Fully half of those who came to us last year went wrong at the public-school dances right here at Springfield. I believe it is high time some one was coming out against such evil."

Clara J. Jones, field worker for the North Dakota House of Mercy, declares that "75 to 90 per cent of those who have slipped over the edge and slid into the pitfall of sex sin and entered unmarried motherhood at the North Dakota House of Mercy tell one story — the dance." In her recorded experiences, entitled "Shall We Dance?" she submits the following case material from her files, each an actual statement, of course under an assumed name:

Lucy: "My mother used to warn me; but we think of our mothers as old-fashioned. I smoked to be sociable, and the reason I drank I cannot say. I started to dance at sixteen and used to dance almost all Saturday night.... If I only hadn't gone into that company in my small home town, I am sure things would have been different. I am the only one in the family who has gone astray, and it is going to be hard to face it all. I am glad now that my mother is old-fashioned."

Teckla: "I think the biggest reason for fallen men and women is the dance. Most of them go wrong at the dance. I have been called a 'stick in the mud' many times for not smoking and drinking, but I danced, and that had much to do with my downfall."

Jane: "I met the father of my illegitimate child at a dancing and drinking party, I am ashamed to say. I used to say that a nice dance, well chaperoned, was all right, but I have changed my mind."

Nancy: "I resent any familiarity on the part of a stranger; but when I dance with some one I like, the feelings come. The modern wild dances are more likely to do so than the old-fashioned ones, except the waltz. Jazz just stirs me up so I am ready for almost anything; but the soft, dreamy, gliding waltz affects me the most."

Susie: "There is too much drinking being done, especially at small-town dances, and there is an atmosphere of looseness and the I-don't-care attitude. It will affect the dancers on the ride home and when parking in the yard, if not before. ... It takes so little at times to let yourself slide into sin."

Now, many will readily grant that the dance-hall is a public menace and that the suggestive dance under all circumstances deserves censure. They will say, however, that the statements of fallen girls present only a very lurid side of a situation in which others have had entirely different reactions. These rescue-home inmates, it may be asserted, are of the type which would have succumbed to other temptations in different forms. For, we are told, to the pure all things are pure; and Christians may be trusted to dance without the danger of suggestiveness.

Young people earnestly and repeatedly assure us that they have danced without these thoughts; and we have been so impressed with their sincerity that we are not willing to dismiss their words with the summary dictum that they are either abnormal or un-truthful. Yet, even if a young woman may dance for the sheer joy of the rhythm, this pastime, innocent perhaps for her, may have an altogether different appeal to her dancing companion. Nor can the element of offense always be ignored. While I would not assert that clean and unobjectionable dancing is impossible, I believe that the postures, the seductive appeal of modern dance music, the surroundings, of many dances, make every dance a danger. Young people who know the repeated warnings of Scripture will hear their Savior's voice raised in this warning that condemns even sinful glances and carnal desires: "I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matt. 5:28). Impressed by their own weak-nesses, they should above all be open and honest with themselves and face squarely the moral dangers which few intelligent advocates of the dance will deny. They should ask themselves whether their prayer "Lead us not into temptation" can be spoken with the hope of a divine answer when they deliberately lead themselves into the most dangerous of modern amusements, where concessions to unholy desires are repeatedly demanded.

The dance causes the Church much heartache. How readily and happily the Church offers every clean and thrilling pleasure to its young people! How unhesitatingly it would give this debated pastime to its young people if it were just plain, exhilarating fun! Because Christ has put the souls of His children on the conscience of the Church, and because the line of demarcation that separates the Christless world from the Christ-blessed Church must be conspicuously drawn, the Church cannot escape its divinely imposed duty. Even though modern churches throw open their parlors for dances (disappointing though they usually are); even though it is true that "more than a million... were estimated in 1931 to be studying, more or less seriously, ballroom dancing" (quotation in Leisure, p. 298); even though the White House issues appeals for more dancing centers, the Church's voice of friendly warning dare not be silenced.

## CRITERIA OF HAPPY CHOICE

### THE BEST MARRIAGE AGE

The wife of thy youth - Prov. 5:18

Statistics prepared by Eastern investigators show that for a girl of twenty in our country the chance of being married before thirty is two to one in her favor, and the chances that she will be married before twenty-five are about even. At thirty the ratio of marriage probability within the next ten years is only two to one against her. For a young man the figures differ radically. At twenty his prospects lag behind a young woman's; but at thirty they are distinctly better, and as his age increases, they continue to remain better.

#### A PROTRACTED DEBATE

A question of more practical concern should be the query, "At what age am I best prepared for a happy marriage?" No statistical solution can be found for this. It is a personal question that requires an individual answer.

There have always been champions of early marriage. They have pointed especially to the biological capacity for marriage in youth, as well as to the preponderance of early marriages over late in the records of conventional matrimony. In his Modern Marriage Dr. Paul Popenoe makes a strong case for early unions (pp. 49-59). Some of his arguments are cogent: early marriage tends to result in larger families; early motherhood is easier and safer; delayed marriage tends to increase the strain on the emotions. But when the claim is advanced that early marriage permits a wider choice of mates, the very obvious fact is overlooked that a young woman who marries at twenty-three certainly has had a wider choice in the five additional years of unmarried existence than the girl who became a bride at eighteen. Again, when he contends that "early marriages often make for happy and lasting unions," it must be remembered that statistical evidence sometimes points to contradictory results. We doubt, too, whether, as he claims, the children of early marriages will be healthier, show greater intelligence, and live longer than the offspring of more mature marriages. An investigation in Baltimore, conducted by the United States Children's Bureau in 1915, showed that boys and girls of resident parents on the average had a lower mortality rate when their mothers were over twenty than when under twenty.

We find, however, a pronounced tendency to advocate a more mature age for marriage. Thus Dr. S. P. Brooks, president of Baylor University, would have the States enact legislation permitting young men to marry only after they have reached twenty-two and young women nineteen. Dr. Richard C. Cabot of Harvard says that the ideal marriage age is twenty-four or twenty-five. Justice Selah B. Strong of the New York divorce tribunal emphatically avows: "It would be better if girls waited until they were twenty-six or even thirty before they married." Shaw Desmond, Irish novelist and lecturer, declares: "I do not believe in early marriages. I believe a man should marry at thirty-three and a woman at twenty-seven or thirty." Professor Hornell Hart of the graduate department of Bryn Maw asserts that the best ages in which women can marty are between twenty-five and thirty-three.

This array of conflicting opinions is submitted as evidence for the futility of establishing a minimum age most conducive to marital happiness. Of two young men each twenty-five years old one may have a mental age of twenty and the other of thirty. Two young women born on the same day may differ radically in their physical, mental, and social development when they reach twenty-one. Environment, education, social contacts, religious training, all — far from developing in constant proportion with age — vary to such well-known degrees that the search for a best marriage age applicable to all matrimonial candidates is doomed to failure.

#### NOT TOO EARLY!

Yet certain basic warnings should be voiced. One of these is: Do not marry too early! The investigations of the Russell Sage Foundation reveal that there are more than 667,000 people (largely white and native-born) in our country who were less than sixteen years old when they married. (See Child Marriages, by Mary E. Richmond and Fred S. Hall.) During the academic year 1930 to 1931 the New York public schools expelled 552 pupils because of marriage. We shudder when we read of the child marriages in Asia; we are horror-stricken when we hear that "over eight and one half million girls, or half of the girls of India, are married before they are fifteen years of age. More than two hundred thousand are under five years, over two million are between five and ten years, and over six million are between ten and fifteen years of age." (Laymen's Foreign Mission Inquiry; India-Burma, p. 247.) But our own marriage laws in about a dozen States permit a legal marriage at the minimum of twelve for girls and fourteen for boys (either by statute or by judicial decisions under common law), while the Child Marriage Restraint Bill, enacted in April, 1930, for all communities in British India, renders illegal the marriage of girls under fourteen and of boys under eighteen, "with penalties of imprisonment and fines for all who contract, perform, conduct, or direct such marriage as well as for the parent or guardian of any minor who contracts such a marriage, whether he promotes it or is merely permissive or negligent in preventing it." (American Journal of Sociology, 1930, p. 1026.)

Investigations of the dates on Roman inscriptions, gravestones, and official records show that at the beginning of the Christian era girls were normally wed between the ages of twelve and fourteen, their husbands usually being a year or two their seniors. In the Middle Ages "feudal society had no place for girls who did not marry, and marry young. It was the Church which came to their rescue... But what of the well-born girl who was not destined for a nunnery? Of her it may be said that she married, she married young, and she married the man selected for her by her father. The careful father would expect to arrange for his daughter's marriage and often marry her before she was fourteen." (Crump and Jacob, Legacy of the Middle Ages, p. 413.)

Today in the Mohammedan world a child bride of tender years is most highly prized. An experienced traveler among the Moslems relates: "I have in my journeyings had a few opportunities of speaking on delicate subjects with Mohammedans, and occasionally rather intimately. One of the many things which I have against Mohammed is the bad example which he set in marrying a girl (Ayesha) of six, which marriage was consummated when she was only three or four years older. I was once talking with a Mohammedan, and I asked him, Soleiman, are you married?' 'No,' he said, 'not yet.' 'I will give you good advice; mind that you do not marry any one under sixteen years of age.' "That is too old,' he replied. "You must marry them young and make them obedient and humble. If they are too old, they are likely to become too cheeky. No; I must marry a young girl and train her up to my ways and likings.'"

Court records of Chester, England, preserve the following testimony of a sixteenth-century divorce trial which F. J. Furnival reprints in Child Marriages, Divorces, and Ratifications, A.D. 1561-66, p. 25: "Johannes Somerforth ... dicit [says] that he was present bie, when John Somerforth and Jane Brerton wer married together in the parish church at Brerton about twelve yeres ago. ... He saies that he carried the said John in his armes, being at the tyme of the said marriage about three yeres of age, and spake some of the words of Matrimonye, that the said John, by reason of his yonge age could not speak him selfe, holding him in his armes all the while the words of Matrimonye were in speaking. And one James Holford carried the said Jane in his armes, being at the same tyme about two yeres of age, and spake all, or the most part of the words of Matrimonye for her, and so held her still in his armes."

In some historically significant marriages the brides were unbelievably young. Charlemagne's wife, the mother of Rotrud, was thirteen years old when she married. Lucretia Borgia was the same age at her wedding. Anna Melanchthon was fourteen when she married Georg Sabinus, the first rector of the University of Koenigsberg. Margarete of Parma was twelve years old when she married Alexander de Medici and twenty years old when she married Ottavio Parnesio, seven years younger than she. Marie Antoinette was fourteen and a half at her marriage. (For other instances of early marriages see Ludwig Friedlaender, Sitten-geschichte Roms, ninth and tenth editions, by Georg Wissowa, Vol. IV, p. 140 ff.) And lest we incline to relegate these youthful marriages to the Dark Ages or to distant hemispheres, listen to John C. Campbell in his The Southern Highlander and His Homeland as he describes child marriage in the isolation of our own Appalachian Mountains: "As a rule, marriage comes early in the mountains. A girl is a spinster at eighteen and on the 'cull list' by twenty. The writer has had pupils leave school at twelve and thirteen to marry, although this is becoming less common every year. ... There is little comfort for the spinster, relegated to the hard tasks of life, yet dependent for support upon her male and her married women kindred, all of whom are agreed in thinking her a failure. "Then you ben't married,' said the weary mountain mother of many children to a teacher from a distant church-school, 'and you don't look like you minded it nuther."

The unfortunate consequences of such early marriage are apparent. A Philadelphia domestic-relations court finds juvenile marriage a basic cause in many divorce cases, its records showing that by far the majority of couples who found legal advice necessary were well under twenty-five when they married, while "the marriages of those who did not take the step until considerably later are the marriages that are lasting." Judge Thomas F. Graham, who has presided over divorce cases in San Francisco for a quarter of a century, concludes epigrammatically: "Sixteen-year-old brides too often are seventeen-year-old grass widows." Mrs. Minnie Madison, Minneapolis police mother, claims: "The young person who marries before twenty doesn't know true love from puppy love." And there are often other distinctions which youthful spouses cannot make, grave problems that lie beyond the edge of their abbreviated experience. Small wonder, then, that Dr. Harry M. Warren, president of the Save-a-Life League, commenting on these child marriages, enumerates their tragic results in these words: "Many of these children soon after marriage find that they have made a great mistake in their choice, quarrel, separate, get divorced, and supply many of our suicides as well as homicides."

An interesting investigation sponsored by the Women's City Club of New York, A Study of Child and Youthful Marriages in New York County, tabulates the marital experiences of seventy-five girls who obtained marriage licenses in New York before they were sixteen years old and shows that nine of the seventy-five never lived with their husbands; five returned immediately after marriage, to their parental roof; fifteen lived with their husbands for two months or less; and twenty for a year or less.

If the privilege of helping to direct the affairs of the government is prudently restricted to those who have attained the legal majority of twenty-one years, should not wisdom dictate that in the immeasurably more personal issue of marriage a similar standard of maturity normally be observed? Common sense, not to make the higher appeal to the seriousness of marital and parental responsibilities, demands that no one assume the obligations of marriage until old enough to know its full implication. With school attendance in many States compulsory until the sixteenth or seventeenth year, it is apparent that the average young man will not be adequately prepared for wedded life until he is twenty-one; and we believe that in some cases a few years could be added to this average minimum with a corresponding increase of domestic happiness. The minimum for a girl may be two or three years lower, but here, too, the reasonable maturity of added years may usually contribute to the solidarity of the marriage.

#### NOT TOO LATE!

Conversely, however, it becomes necessary to stress this warning: Do not marry too late! It is deeply significant that the Scriptures speak of "the wife of thy youth" (Prov. 5:18); and the picture of two young people, delineated in some of our best-loved poems, as they journey, arms entwined, along the highway to nuptial happiness, will always remain the ideal in marriage. The earlier wedding has been regarded by American scientists as a symbol of success. In their The Builders of America Huntington and Whitney show (p. 251) that successful men married on the average about two and a half years earlier than the less successful. This, the authors say, "is an indication that men who are physically, mentally, and morally sound and vigorous are not only more eager to marry than the opposite types but are more attractive to women and more likely to be well established in their life-work and hence able to support children and wife at an early age."

In their book of reminiscences entitled We Twa Lord Aberdeen, twice Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Governor-General of Canada at the end of the last century, and Lady Aberdeen, representatives of fine Victorianism, almost on the eve of their golden wedding anniversary, advise: "Be sure that you find your right mate as early as you can in life, and let your sympathetic understanding of one another lead you to take up together pursuits outside your business, which will not only be a protection against the carking cares of daily worries, but which will in some way or other be of service to wider circles outside your home. Thus you will together keep your hearts young."

False standards, however, are often responsible for deplorable delay and postponement in many marriages. Sociologists in the Irish Free State are alarmed over the fact that, while the usual marrying age in England is the early twenties, the Irishman's present average is forty. There is reason for parallel alarm in certain trends on this side of the Atlantic. A young man consoles himself with the delusion that he is taking an unselfish course when he insists that he will not marry until he has $5,000 deposited in the savings-bank. The attainment of this goal requires more time and financial concentration than he had imagined in the balmy days of high salaries. He is thirty-five now, and bad investments still help to separate him from that tantalizing goal. When he marries, if he does, his thirty-five years will generally find him encrusted in acquired customs, with a fixed attitude toward life that scouts all flexibility. How different the picture might have been if a dozen years before he had married a sweet, wholesome girl, whose intuition and advice might have spared him some of his financial fiascos and whose love would have been an irresistible incentive to success!

Or, here is a girl who tosses a defiant head at the cumulative counsel of experience and sophistically declares that she couldn't think of tying herself down until she is thirty. By the expiration of that limit she may look in vain for a marital attachment. She might have had the companionship of a loving husband, the affection of devoted children, the happiness of her own home; but now all this becomes more problematical with every year. Even though a middle-aged knight gallant rescue her from spinsterhood, she will find that marriage at thirty-five or forty may lack some of the verve and thrill which she had anticipated fifteen or twenty years before. She may experience difficulty in effecting the readjustment required by the change from business life to the functions of domesticity; for ingrained customs of long years' growth cannot be overthrown in a few hasty moments. According to normal expectancy her years for child-bearing have been reduced; for usually children are not born to a mother after her forties.

It should be remembered, however, that it is almost never too late to enter marriage. Francis Bacon quotes with approval the reputedly wise man who "made answer to the question when a man should marry: 'A young man not yet; an older man not at all.'" As long as there is a sincere and intelligent desire for companionship and the enjoyment of the domestic pleasures, which previously may have been denied, nothing in the Word of God or in the conventions of men would outlaw a belated marriage where husband and wife are of congenial and compatible adaptation. The average age at marriage of the 3,931 new accessions co Who's Who, 1932 to 1933, was 28.44 years, considerably above the age for the general public.

Even though the number of children which may bless a belated union is restricted by the limits of nature's creative cycle, many men of distinction have been born of parents of more advanced years. We may find some consolation in the claim of A. F. Dutton in the Encyclopedia Brittanica (14th edition), whose investigation of 1,000 persons of outstanding achievement shows that children born to fathers of more than forty-five years have twice the chances of inherited capability than those under forty-five have, that the chances are tenfold when the paternal age is more than sixty and fiftyfold when the father is seventy years of age. James Watts, John Wesley, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Henry Ward Beecher, are names taken from a long catalog of illustrious men who demonstrate this truth. Even if the mysterious fires of creative life may have smoldered to ashes, there remains in marriage that which must outlive the surging impulses of youth: love, honor, and trust. These are of such abiding value that sometimes Christian experience teaches: It is better to marry late than never marry at all.

#### NOT TOO DISSIMILAR!

At whatever age marriage may be consummated, there should not be a pronounced difference in the ages of husband and wife, if the highest home happiness is to be realized. In a syndicated newspaper article a professional counselor in questions of the heart is asked: "What do you think of a woman marrying a man twenty-five years older than she is? We are both very much in love, but he thinks that a man of sixty will not be treating a woman of thirty-five fairly to marry her; for he will be an old man while she is still in the prime of life. I believe that mutual affection as deep as ours is too precious a gift to throw away and that we should be happy while we can and let the future take care of itself. What do you say?"

This is the answer: "A man of sixty nowadays is still a young man. He isn't even beginning to get old for another ten years, and there is no reason in the world why he shouldn't marry a woman of thirty-five. At that age a woman is old enough to know her mind and to trust her own judgment in such a matter. In many ways an old husband is the best husband, because he is more con-siderate, more tactful, more unselfish, and more anxious to make his wife happy than a young one. Anyway, age is such a matter of temperament that you cannot gage it by birthdays. There are plenty of men of sixty who are really younger than boys of twenty-six."

Because this attitude is widely shared (witness the distressing number of May-December marriages that crash into first-page notoriety), it may be necessary to sound a note of warning against the logic of this reply. Outside the misrepresentation that a man of sixty is still young or that a husband in the twenties is less considerate, tactful, and unselfish than a more mature spouse, the answer completely overlooks the many disparities which separate the attitudes of this couple as widely as their quarter of a century age difference. That there are exceptions even in fundamental rules is probably more actual in affairs of the heart than in any other field of human experience. Luther's wife was fifteen years younger than he; yet their married life was happy. But before any young woman considers herself an exception and believes that happiness can be hers in a spring-and-autumn marriage, she should at least pause and listen to the claims of experience.

While Aristotle asserted that in the ideal marriage the husband should be about eight years older than his wife, sociologists operating in the Domestic Relations courts of Philadelphia tell us that the marriage age which seems to be attended by the least domestic worry finds the groom at twenty-nine and his bride twenty-five. The happiness ratio is not changed decidedly if the groom's age varies to four years in either way, the bride having a corresponding leeway of two years. The trouble starts, at least in Philadelphia, when the bride is under twenty-one and the groom under twenty-four. And when either is under nineteen, the probability of domestic disaster is one hundred times as great as in the ideal ratio. On the other hand, data supplied by Colgate University psychologists seem to modify these statements. From a questionnaire answered by 5 per cent of the married persons listed in Who's Who, the conclusion has been drawn that it is a disadvantage for a wife to be more than two and one half years younger than her husband, twice the disadvantage if she is more than three and one half years younger, and three times the disadvantage if she is more than five and one half years younger. Distinctly opposed are the findings of Mrs. Jessie Bernard, who told the American Sociological Society that, according to her investigations of the marital experiences of 115 men and 137 women, husbands were most satisfied when they were as old as their wives or up to ten years older, while wives were most satisfied when their husbands were as old as they themselves or up to five years older. (American Journal of Sociology, September, 1933.)

These three studies are united only in endorsing the accepted custom of regarding a slight preponderance of years as a distinctly desirable qualification for the husband. Biologically a woman ages more rapidly than a man. If the bride is five years older than the groom at marriage, it is said that she will be ten years older when she reaches middle age. If she is but a year or two older than her husband, this disparity should ordinarily provoke no serious concern. The younger husband will not find his responsibilities enhanced, his leadership emphasized, and his happiness promoted by a marriage in which his senior wife enjoys the maturity of much wider and longer experience. It is only by the sheerest exception that a marriage like that of Disraeli, in which the wife was thirteen years older than her illustrious husband, can be as happy as that unique union was.

We may agree, then, somewhat facetiously, that the right marriage age is the time when the right man or the right young woman begins to lay happy siege to the heart. The verdict of experience that accrues from a survey of the best and fullest lives assures us that a union of two blended careers of compatible ages, animated by the clean, trustful idealism and in the throbbing vigor of mature Christian youth, holds out high hope for happiness. This harmony of joy is too exalted to be pushed into the offing, too precious to permit the loss of one postponed day.

### BEAUTY PLUS!

The maid was fair and beautiful - Esther 2:7

That American youth today, as the youth of all lands and ages, regards personal comeliness with marked approval is a truism continually demonstrated by the answers to the many questionnaires on the subject "The girl I would like to marry" or "The man I want as husband." Princeton freshmen, responding to formal questions of this kind, emphasize good looks as "the first essential quality of the ideal girl." Wisconsin University freshmen are satisfied with a girl who is "just nice to look at." Less pronounced is the attitude expressed in the answers to a questionnaire submitted to 5,000 young people, members of the Walther League, the young people's organization of the Lutheran Synodical Conference. Of the ballots returned by the young women, 35 per cent made prominent reference to physical attractions, stating that the ideal husband must be "handsome," "good-looking," "attractive." Among the male voters the requirement of comeliness was stressed even more strongly, 51 per cent of the ballots insisting upon physical attractiveness.

These expressions are generally evidence of commendable judg-ment, and they are endorsed by the Scriptures, in which human beauty is recognized as a notable blessing. The prominence which the Bible accords to the attractive women who figure on its pages is sometimes overlooked. But a closer survey presents Sarah as of such extraordinary beauty that even at seventy years (approximately middle age in that era) she was regarded by the Egyptians as "very fair" (Gen. 12:14); Rebecca, "very fair to look upon" (Gen. 26:7); Rachel, "beautiful and well favored" (Gen. 29:17) ; Job's daughters, "the fairest of all the women in the land" (Job 42:15); Esther, the maid "fair and beautiful" (Esther 2:7); and other godly young women distinguished for their personal attractiveness. With this Scriptural emphasis there can be room for no other estimate of beauty than this, that it is a preeminent gift of God, which should be cherished.

Because of this Scriptural premise American girls are not to be censured for the desire to preserve and develop their loveliness. The position of the Church has often been libeled and caricatured by iconoclastic writers, who have pictured clergymen as gaunt, snooping misanthropes, stigmatizing everything beautiful as sin and hurling anathemas at the girl who tries to look her best. Attempts to justify this slander may be based on the utterances of some ascetic preacher who, pushing his Bible aside, looks at the youth of the Church with smoked glasses and denounces every approach to beauty. The Christian Church has never shared this misshapen protest against loveliness. How could it when an entire book of the Bible, the Song of Songs, which pictures the spiritual unity between Christ and His believers under the symbolism of a marriage, calls the bride, the Church, the "fairest among women"?

Neither must a girl be stupid because she is attractive. Armand T. Nickels, who for four years directed the school for vanity at Atlantic City, called America's Beauty Pageant, seems to have become embittered by his experience. He complains: "Most of the pretty girls I have met have heads as empty as their faces are beautiful." While beauty-contest entrants almost automatically classify themselves in the category of the mentally mediocre, it has been shown in a study of 1,030 men and women of British genius that in more than 50 per cent of their biographies their noteworthy physical beauty is stressed. In our own country a review of our acquaintances among the leaders in the several fields of social, educational, or commercial activity will call to mind a group of men and women whose appearance matches their distinction.

Nor is a girl gifted with rare attraction necessarily of moronic mind. It is true that to a very marked degree certain young women, intimately and lavishly publicized, have flaunted their beauty before the public gaze as they have helped to swell the records of marital scandal. But to counterbalance this notoriety sometimes associated with performers on the stage and screen, we have a long list of attractive women who have contributed in many ways to the improvement of the nation.

#### NO PAGAN CULT OF THE BODY!

Yet beauty in itself, detached from all ideals of morality and intelligence, is never exalted in the divine Word. The Bible recognizes no form of that pagan cult of the body which makes young women vestals at the shrine of pulchritude. On the contrary, the fatal attachments of beauty without a corresponding inner attraction are plainly outlined in some of the tragedies of Scripture. One thinks almost instinctively either of Bathsheba, the woman who "was very beautiful to look upon" (2 Sam. 11:2), or of Tamar, a woman of a fair countenance (2 Sam. 13:1). As a background to these catastrophes we recall that antediluvian cult of the body practiced when the sons of God, the descendants of Seth, took as wives the fair daughters of men, whose beauty was their sole distinction (Gen. 6:2).

Because there must be beauty plus, Solomon warns: "As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion" (Prov. 11:22); and since beauty of the soul is far more essential than outward adornment, the summary of everyday wisdom which we call the Book of Proverbs closes its 900 verses with this impressive statement: "Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates" (Prov. 31:30, 31).

While love cannot be blind to physical charm, much less can it be indifferent to inner attractiveness. The girl who permits her choice to be swayed by a suitor whose only assets are stature and appearance, and the young man who is swept off his feet by a pretty face and attractive clothing, without pausing to inquire for that quality which is not skin-deep, but soul-deep, are to be pitied before they are censured.

A comely quality is found in every life transformed through the beauty of holiness. The Church's youth is well called the dew of the morning (Ps. 110:3); for there is an inimitable sparkle in the radiance of a Christ-centered young man or young woman, in comparison with which the mere beauty of the flesh seems remotely incidental and woefully inadequate. He chooses well who finds a soul resplendent with faith's happiness, even though the measurements of the De Milo perfections be missing and the features of ravishing beauty be sought in vain.

Add to this the well-mannered, soft-spoken, considerate, and intelligent charm in a young woman regardless of her pulchritude rating, and you have a complete compensation for any handicap in appearance. Even academic wisdom quite void of any spiritual impulse agrees. Listing the requirements of attractiveness in a talk at an Evanston, Illinois, school for charm, the dean of women of Northwestern University made no mention of physical beauty. Commenting on this omission, the leaders in this charm course declared: "If a girl has all these qualities, she will not be handicapped by the lack of a pretty face. Her friends will not notice her face. A pretty girl who lacks charm, on the other hand, might as well be ugly, for all the good it will do her."

Men who suffer from unusual physical handicaps likewise need not despair of happiness and marriage. Joseph Fels, internationally known soap-manufacturer, who "rose from poverty to great wealth without robbing anybody," was of small stature. An acquaintance writes: "He was no larger than a twelve-year-old boy. But in mind and heart he was one of the greatest and noblest men of his generation. He was so lovable that it is hard to write about him without being carried away in saying too much." His subnormal proportions did not embitter his life. When he was twenty, he fell in love with a young woman who was likewise unusually small; and their marriage was exceedingly happy.

#### THE SECRET OF CHARM

Within the last years commercialized interests have come to the fore by offering charm as though it were a market commodity purchasable at reduced prices. An Eastern concern specializing in correspondence courses on attractive personality sells its charm book at exactly half price, including a personal autograph of the author if desired. With particular appeal to young women the impression is created that for two dollars and fifty cents you can learn how to "impress other people favorably at all times." The author, characterized as "the most-sought-after counselor of women in the world," an adviser to whom "many have paid heavy fees," for whom "society women await their turn to receive her counsel," promises that her cut-price volume will "inspire you to grace and gracious-ness"; that "you will have an allure which time will only deepen and a personal happiness beyond the ordinary understanding." People will behold the "graciousness of your words" and "the glowing light" of "your countenance," and "all who see you pass will say, 'What is the magic of this woman? I cannot forget her. She is a mystery to me. I must fathom her secret.'"

Rather amazing is this challenge and promise: "Read it at night before you go to sleep and see what it does to you." Some of us would be afraid of nightmare, — what with all the emphasis upon the social blunders that might be committed in "the grand tier at the opera — on a magnificent yacht — in a box at the races."

The proportions which the "allure" business has assumed is startling. An investigator in 1937 described one New York charm center with scores of workers, who sent out 70,000 pieces of mail every day. Another concern with a formula claiming that charm is 50 per cent appearance, 40 per cent personality, and 10 per cent tact numbers approximately 10,000 charm pupils, who pay $30 for a ten weeks' course, with two mimeographed lessons each week. A third "loveliness" institute, in New York City, seems definitely directed toward helping its clients find handsome and wealthy husbands.

We are all normally attracted by those who, avoiding man-nerisms, show acquaintance with the requirements of etiquette. It is equally indisputable that our young ladies should acquire correct posture and grace in movements. Yet the personalities that impress us and whose recollections linger in our minds have attracted our attention and interest by something more than this. Again we concede that conversational ability, tact in speaking and listening, choice diction, as well as the talent of writing correct letters with the impress of individuality and interest are signs of good training. Conversational leaders and correspondence experts, however, may often be interesting without being charming. In short, the self-expression that attracts people cannot be secured for two dollars and a half, or for two million and a half, for that matter. Charm, first of all, is a matter of good breeding, good thinking, a commonsense naturalness, an unselfish interest in one's fellow-men, and a genuine desire to develop one's talents and endowments. No better basis for true and lasting charm exists than the instruction of the apostle: "Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue and if there be any praise, think on these things. Those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do; and the God of peace shall be with you" (Phil. 4:8, 9) .

Young women who are not endowed with glamorous beauty and who bemoan their plain features as an unhappy discrimination should find compensation in acquiring a cheerful, wholesome, intelligent poise and bearing. Beauty without intelligence may bask in the spotlight of social popularity where callow youth momentarily pays its dazed tribute; but in the more serious contemplation of marriage the plain young woman of preeminent spiritual and intellectual attainments enjoys a definite preference by every young man who can distinguish between glitter and gold.

#### ATTRACTIVE CLOTHING

Clothing is an important factor in every girl's quest of charm. The present-day styles have generally reached a height of saneness only rarely attained in the past generations. By way of contrast and for a refreshing appreciation of dress normalcy it may be well to read this description of apparel displayed by Russian ladies in the days of Peter the Great:

"They wore a sort of dress of which the sleeves were ten to twelve yards long. These sleeves were made very full and were drawn up upon the arm in a sort of puff, it being the fashion to have as great a length of sleeve as could possibly be crowded on between the shoulder and the wrist. The customary salutation between ladies and gentlemen in society, when this dress was in fashion, was performed through the intervention of the sleeves. On the approach of the gentleman, the lady, by a sudden and dex- dex. terous motion of her arm, would throw off the end of her sleeve to him. The sleeve, being so very long, could be thrown in this way half across the room. The gentleman would take the sleeve, which represented, we are to suppose, the hand of the lady, and after kissing and saluting it in a most respectful manner, he would resign it, and the lady would draw it back again on her arm."

In a general way, too, the price of clothing and millinery has dropped to a level which is much more proportionate with income than during past centuries. How meager the wardrobe even of princes and presidents in comparison with the royal raiment of Louis XIV, who in his public-audience days at Versailles stood on a platform of silver, resplendent in a costume that cost twelve million dollars! His wedding garment of velvet, lavishly embroidered with gold and studded with jewels, was much more modest, since its cost was in excess of only one million dollars. Compare with these expenditures the Parisian dress, costing only several hundred dollars, which Wallis Warfield wore when she was married to the Duke of Windsor. A few weeks after the wedding, copies and variations of the duchess's wedding dress sold in New York for around sixteen dollars and later for six dollars.

In spite of the many commendable features in woman's apparel, violations of a wise, healthy attitude of modesty in dress periodically present themselves. In a recent issue of a New York newspaper a seductive advertisement publicizes "the Mephisto Mode" for women, calculatingly exhibited as a "new highly polished evening sophistication." Its flaunting colors are appropriately "inferno red with pitch black"; the fur decorations — what else could they be but monkey! This combination of Mephisto with monkey has its point. But for our present purposes we drop the simian element to discuss the satanic. Has it actually come to this, that American women are ready to revel in a style that commemorates a prince of hell?

Other clothing designers, not to be outdone, have added competitive names. We read another advertisement from one of the better New York stores which presents a new mode called "Black Panther" and is described in this way, "as slinky and alluring as its namesake." Another exclusive shop features "Siren Negligée, with the promise that "it gives you... glamor for moments when you frankly want to be as pampered as a movie star." A New York department store features "Furore in Paris, a provocative dinner costume," which is described in this way: "Your shoulders covered — the rest of you a series of wicked little tricks of low decolletage, slashed hem, curving hips a la Zaza - that's the way Paris is dressing now for dining out. Deliberately provocative. Ultrasophisticated."

Now the perfume industry has taken over the idea. The better stores in New York are selling "French Cancan," with this description: "Wicked inspiration from the famous girls at Bal Tabarin in Paris." Ravishing lip-sticks are described as producing a "wickedly beautiful" effect. — Perhaps this accounts for the fact that another of the stores advertises a "blush cream," guaranteeing amazing instant action in bringing "color to the cheeks."

That there is a direct connection between the forces of evil and the type of clothing that some young women display is a truth long acknowledged by the Church and now recognized particularly in the wave of sex crimes by psychologists and scientific investigators themselves. A police woman from the nation's capital, discussing the cause of delinquency and offense on the part of our young people, indicts certain types of young women "because they parade their sex by scanty costumes." An Oklahoma prosecutor reviewing these terrifying crimes, declares, "Every mother should consider seriously the kind of clothes her daughter wears." A Michigan attorney finds the cause for serious criminal charge in the lure of wearing-apparel. The superintendent of the Cook County Psychopathic Hospital, who is also associate professor of mental diseases at Loyola University, warns, "There is a group of moral weaklings on whom styles exercise a degrading effect. They are neither noticeably intelligent nor feeble-minded."

Whatever effects the current and extreme decolletage may have on others, it can hardly be disputed that the daring, revealing type of clothing tends in itself to destroy the wearer's appreciation of modesty. A closer connection between apparel and personal morality doubtless exists in more cases than has been hitherto conceded.

Another unfortunate consequence of this bold and extreme display may be found in the tragedy that makes inordinate demands on time and money. Some girls, utterly impervious to the better things in life, quite unconcerned about the spiritual side of their narrow, stunted lives, expend practically all' their salary surplus in replenishing their wardrobe and keeping up with the latest and most rigorous dictates of fashion. It is often just a species of the pagan cult of the body, this worship of style and the simultaneous refusal to develop the mind, to grow in intellectual grace, to fortify the spiritual life. And what a bad bargain this concentration on clothes proves to be when it leaves the wearer with only a little more animation than that of a window dummy!

This is not a tirade against attractive, stylish clothing. Even in the Scriptures, Isaiah calls on Jerusalem to "put on beautiful garments"; and in the Forty-fifth Psalm the Messiah and His bride, the Church, are pictured in striking vesture of varied color, embroidered in the gold of Ophir, and self-evidently the Holy Spirit would not have employed any sinful conception as a symbol of inner and spiritual beauty. Every normal Christian young woman wants to look her best and dislikes the idea of wearing the cast-off styles of yesteryear. The questions of apparel rightly receive some of her attention. No rational person shares the ideals of Hetty Green, who, when she was a young woman, hoarded the money given her for buying presentable clothes. Even on her honeymoon abroad she continued to wear old, faded garments. Bellow Falls, Connecticut, the home of the Greens, waited eagerly to see the luxury and plenty which the wealthy bride, they hoped, would bring to the community. Instead, she arrived in disreputable attire, — and worse, her face and her hands were filthy. In her penuriousness she fashioned underclothing of newspapers to save expense, and for the same reason she had only the bottoms of her petticoats laundered. At her death her fortune was estimated at between $75,000,000 and $100,000,000.

Only one basic restriction is placed on Christian women, young and old, according to which, in the words of Saint Paul to Timothy, they are to "adorn themselves with modest apparel." This appeal of the apostle is, of course, the final and decisive voice for every follower of Christ in all questions of dress. Whether it is the matter of bathing-suits, athletic costumes, summer-apparel, or evening dress, this one inexorable rule remains: Let Christian women "adorn themselves in modest apparel." No matter what the dictates of Christless fashion may be, no matter how the rest of the crowd at the office, at school, on the beach, on the tennis-court, or on a hike may dress and act, the divine standard for every Christian girl in all her activities is always — "modest apparel."

#### HEALTH AND EUGENICS

All young people who would enter marriage should have the assurance that they are free of grave physical defects which would prevent them from bringing healthy children into the world. It is not only our sacred duty to preserve and promote our personal physical well-being; when the health of others is involved, as in marriage, we have the added responsibility of bestowing extraordinary thought and care upon the physical fitness of the prospective husband or wife.

However, health is at best only a matter of degree. An Eastern life-insurance company reports that of 2,000,000 applicants not one furnished a perfect health record. While young people should endeavor to bring their future life-mates a clean bill of physical fitness, the extremes of radical physical culture must be avoided. Many a girl suffering from some impediment, perhaps lameness, or defective hearing, weak eyes, or similar handicaps, may bring more happiness into a home than a perfect-posture prize-winner, a tennis champion, or an Amazon who thrives on an uncooked-food and raw-meat diet. Athletes, it is frequently alleged, make particularly good husbands, not only because they are accustomed to discipline and have been trained in the doctrine of team-play, but also because of their physical fitness. Yet the list of athletes who have been matrimonial failures is disproportionate.

The extreme demands for physical perfection, as formulated by the alarmist advocates of eugenics, often exceed the limits of the rational and the Christian. As a formal science, eugenics (literally good breeding) was introduced in the nineteenth century largely by the work of Sir Francis Galton. Through the establishment of fellowships and the endowment of eugenic laboratories in London as well as through the support of related studies in genetics and heredity this research into the principles of heritable and trans-mittible characteristics has enjoyed wide-spread and scientific atten-tion; a sizable literature has sprung up; and eugenics has been popularized as few branches of biological science. Because of the growing agitation for sterilization in the Western States of our country and as a consequence of the Nazi insistence upon a pure Nordic stock eugenics have been popularized for the masses as never before.

In a general way, eugenics endeavors to "elevate" men to the stage of pure-blooded thoroughbreds. Citing the favorite example of the race-horse and the efforts of horse-breeders to produce the best possible strain of prize-winners, eugenics enthusiasts draw the conclusion that a similar ennobling of the human strain is possible and that legislation should be framed to protect the process by which better human beings are to be bred. These efforts of eugenists have customarily been grouped under two heads: 1) negative eugenics, the theory that those who are suffering from incurable and communicable mental or physical diseases (or from hereditary predisposition to such diseases) should be prevented from marrying; 2) positive eugenics, the complementary effort to surround the physically and mentally superior members of the human race with the best inducements to propagate the best possible children and, in general, to adopt all methods of improving the human family so that the superman and, in the aggregate, the superrace may ultimately populate the earth.

#### THE CHURCH AND FADDIST EUGENICS

The Church is not unsympathetic to a broad interpretation of the eugenic desire to improve the human race. It does not hide its head in the sands of theological abstractions while research in heredity presents its theories of genes and chromosomes. It has never protested against State legislation like that in Minnesota, Michigan, Kansas, and Oregon, where epileptics, insane or feeble-minded persons are generally prohibited from marrying, or that in Michigan, Illinois, and other States, where marriage is forbidden to any one who suffers from an uncured social disease. In a broad way the Church has consistently practiced negative eugenics by advising that victims of advanced tuberculosis, social diseases, and similar maladies should not marry. If the simple application of common sense in rejecting as a marriage partner any one contaminated with a loathsome and recurrent disease is eugenics; if the careful premarital investigation of physical characteristics is an integral part of eugenics, then every Christian should be a eugenist.

In this faddist age, however, eugenics should be spelled with an initial capital because it has come to denote a peculiarly technical cult and a program of extremist principles that penetrates into almost every fiber of the modern social fabric. Some of the claims in the eugenic platform are scientifically, morally, and socially reprehensible.

First of all, the eugenic policy suffers from the deficiency of operating on uncertainties. Excepting a group of basic laws of heredity, the science of genetics has little firm ground under its feet at this time. Encyclopedia Britannica summarizes: "It can hardly be said that the science has advanced beyond the stage of disseminating a knowledge of the laws of heredity so far as they are surely known." If we ask how far these laws of heredity are known and with what certainty a theory of the transmission of traits may be built up, Prof. H. S. Jennings, geneticist of Johns Hopkins University, gives these basic facts: "Every pair of human parents contains thousands of pairs of the chemical packets (genes) on which development depends. From these a set is drawn almost at random (subject to the condition that one packet is taken from each pair possessed by each parent); this constitutes the heritage of the child. Any pair of parents may thus produce not merely thousands, but millions of different combinations, each yielding a child of different characteristics. There is no way of controlling the combinations that shall enter into a child of given parents; there is no prospect that there ever will be.

"It is therefore impossible to predict what kind of offspring will be produced by a given pair of parents, save in a few respects, in cases where the constitution of both packets of a particular pair are known for each parent. If both parents have the corresponding pairs defective in the same manner, - lacking, for example, something required for producing a normal mind, — then their children will be all defective like the parents; feeble-minded parents will produce feeble-minded children. But if, as may well be the case, the feeble mind is due to defects in different packets in the two parents, then all experimental breeding shows that the two parental stocks may supplement one another, so that the defect will not appear in the offspring. The characteristics that are predictable are extremely few."

Outside the laboratory and in the inexorable evidence of life we meet many contradictions to the claims of eugenics. Chisel murderers are millionaires' well-nourished sons; honor students commit suicide; penitentiaries are overcrowded with specimens of well-nigh perfect physique; eugenically mated parents are sometimes sterile, or their offspring may be sickly incubator babies.

True, strong family traits are often noted for several generations. Johann Sebastian Bach represents a long line of noted musicians. For two hundred years before his day Bachs had played and sung with distinction, and so numerous and renowned was this lineage that long after the family had ceased to live in Erfurt musicians in that city were called "Bachs." In the Bach genealogical line, the most musical family known to history, thirty-seven members of six generations exhibited conspicuous musical talent and attained prominence.

The Curies are outstanding as Nobel Prize winners; Pierre and Marie together received the coveted award for physics in 1903, and Marie alone for chemistry in 1911. In 1935 the daughter of the Curies and her husband were awarded the same prize for their work in radioactivity. Similarly Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, miscalled the "father of evolution," and Francis Galton, whom a previous page describes as the pioneer eugenist, as well as Charles Darwin's sons, Francis and George, and the grand-son, Charles, have been noted for outstanding contributions to science. William Herschel, God-fearing astronomer, had a similarly distinguished son and grandson who continued the family's study of the skies.

Criminal traits correspondingly have been notorious in certain families. We note the Kallikaks, 436 descendants from the degenerate son of a feeble-minded mother, among whom were many thieves, robbers, criminals, and prostitutes. Similarly Abraham Markus left 371 descendants, many of whom helped to fill prisons. The Swedish farmer Pehr Person numbered 2,230 descendants, and of these 1,530 were described as degenerates, petty thieves, drunkards, feeble-minded, epileptics.

On the other hand, heredity plays some queer pranks. Biographers commemorating the centennial of Mark Twain's birth declared that, "though John Clemens was the father of the world's greatest humorist, he was never known to laugh and seldom smiled."

The progeny of Jonathan Edwards and Sarah Pierrepont presents a list of distinguished college presidents, teachers, authors, physicians, judges, attorneys, statesmen, ministers, and others of high place in professional or public life. It is also true that this family-tree shows a large company of Edwardses who sank unnoticed beneath mediocrity. It is evidence of eugenist bias that usually the overworked references to this distinguished American family neglect to record that Edwards's own grandmother was divorced for immorality, that his great-aunt murdered her own son, and that one of his great-uncles brutally killed a sister.

Again, the Jukes family, the eugenic Exhibit A, did bring a host of morons into the world; but Dr. J. H. Landman, in his Human Sterilization, reminds us that the Jukeses who left the poverty-cursed regions in the Adirondacks and established themselves in fertile sections became respected members of their communities.

Dr. Landman insists that greatness does not necessarily produce greatness, and as proof he calls attention to a study made by Dr. Pearl of Johns Hopkins. Investigating the biographies of the world's eminent men and women, the Baltimore scientist finds, for example, that of 63 distinguished philosophers the parents of 15 were unknown; that of the parents of the remaining 48 only 2 fathers and 1 mother were distinguished. The conclusion by Dr. Landman is obvious: "The 48 fathers represent a fair cross-section of men in general. To generalize from these facts that great men beget great men would be clearly fallacious. Perhaps some of these fathers would have been sterilized if the advice of some of our eugenists were accepted."

Dr. Caswell Grave, professor of zoology at Washington Uni-versity, asserts: "Rabbits produce rabbits, and fig-trees produce figs, not thistles; but it stops there, and genetics supports the saying of Lincoln that the Lord loved the common people because He made so many of them. Lincoln's own parents were of the commonest. Who's Who is full of the children of humble parents. Persons of ability often breed mediocre children, and mediocrity often produces children of marked ability.... If we had the intelligence and the authority to breed human beings as we breed horses, we might get some results; ... but, after all, no one knows what kind of human being is best to breed." (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, February 28, 1936.)

Stud-farm tactics, even if they could be employed in the breeding of a superrace, would not guarantee the genesis of a physically perfect people. Sir Arthur Keith, eminent British biologist, writing in the London Daily Mail, tells British eugenists: "The most careful and expert breeder of blood stock knows how difficult it is to produce a 'Derby winner.' Yet his problem is simplicity itself compared with that which confronts the anthropologist who would breed 'Derby winners' in human form." Dr. Waldemar Kaempffert summarizes: "Heredity is a powerful factor, ... but it is not the only factor.... It fails to explain the sudden flower-ing of a Shakespeare, an Abraham Lincoln, a John Keats, from unexceptional stocks. 'Like produces like' is not a generally applicable principle." In Napoleon and Julius Caesar, genius, as the world understands it, has sprung from epilepsy. Now, it may be argued that the world would have been better without these two men; but the other leaders in all branches of human affairs who would have been deprived of their existence had the articles of strict eugenics been legalized deal a veritable solar-plexus blow to these claims.

Fundamentally the eugenic theories also suffer from an over-stress of the physical and mental. They assert that, given a healthy race, its heredity will be both healthy and happy. Yet as "man shall not live by bread alone," so national existence, cultural progress, in short, the highest and best of life, comes not by mating perfect specimens of men and women "but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4). Ultimately eugenics leaves no room for God. If we cannot run the world of today without God, how can we hope to govern the generation of tomorrow with-out divine sanction and supervision? Even if this race-building program were biologically possible, the stern element of sin can in a brief moment puff over the house of eugenic cards that has been years in the building.

This cult of the superman imposes a social injustice. It operates to the detriment of the poor. Eugenic literature abounds in case histories centering in tenement districts; and the condescension which is poured out on the less fortunate of humanity is a startling contradiction of Christian ideals. The everlasting poor often have health records that can bear favorable comparison with the vital statistics of royalty's highest castes. To prevent underprivileged individuals from accepting their inalienable and divinely bestowed pleasures of parenthood is not only a physiological error, but it is also an act of presumptuous discrimination.

In this abridgment of personal liberty applied eugenics shows its true colors. Well did Chesterton protest against such ultimate tyranny: "Law and creed and custom have never concentrated heavily except upon fixing and keeping the family when once it has been made. The act of founding the family, I repeat, was an individual adventure outside the frontiers of the state. Our first, forgotten ancestors left this tradition behind them, and our own latest fathers and mothers a few years ago would have thought us lunatics to be discussing it. The shortest general definition of eugenics on its practical side is that it does, in a more or less degree, propose to control some families at least as if they were families of pagan slaves." (Eugenics and Other Evils, p. 10.)

If the state (except in the case of criminals) prohibits mar-riage to any person who is capable of exercising its functions and of whom it cannot be stated definitely that his progeny will be a social liability, this is an unwarranted restriction of personal liberty. The state may exercise its authority in segregating a person hostile to community interests (imprisonment) or whose influence may involve physical contamination and infection (isolation); but if in other cases the question be that of sterilization, it should stand on indubitable ground. Unless in each given case the demonstration can be completed, for example, that imbecility will beget imbecility, the state should not attempt to exercise jurisdiction over the bodies of its citizens. Even then the program of sterilization produces many serious complications and creates many new problems.

This treatment of degenerates and criminals is also open to serious objection, as Dr. Martin Ulbrich mentions in Der Geisteskampf der Gegenwart fuer christliche Bildung und Weltanschauung, 1930, pp. 427-429: "The social pathologist is forced to raise one objection in particular. If he is asked whence most degenerate persons come from, he finds that they are not produced by their own kind, but are the offspring of normal people, who have under-mined their healthy disposition through some misconduct. We are reminded of the many children of drunkards who are victims of alcohol, of the sick children of syphilitic fathers, and of children who before their birth were abused by injurious means, because they were not to come alive into the world, and of the children born in consanguineous marriages who must carry the double burden which both parents have caused them to bear. But these long lists of criminals just mentioned are exceptions, and it is not probable that they would be affected by any sterilization law. The fact is that most of the evils of degeneracy thrive in the circle of those who ignore all morality and decency and who are involved in the worst crimes of the race."

Much sound reasoning will also be found in Dr. Ulbrich's conclusion: "A legal enforcement of sterilization will not achieve the desired results. The best remedy is a comprehensive prophylaxis, which checks the national evils, establishes discipline and order, and promotes decency and morality. In the case of degenerate persons who are liable to reproduce morally defective offspring, it is a better plan to place them, without delay, into protective homes and asylums, where pernicious influences are removed and where those who are afflicted by sinful tendencies are placed at the feet of their Savior to be their Liberator. There are children who give evidence of such developed traits of degeneracy that it is evident how these will develop if they are left to themselves. In order that these may be subjected without delay to helping hands laws, means, and places of refuge should be provided in time. The earlier the prevention is applied, the more effective will the help be. The more these are fortified, the less will the dangers be. An extensive and comprehensive aid will make every sterilization law superfluous and will spare the community the necessity of an operation which is cruel in spite of the perfected technique, which is in reality nothing less than a theft of the person's human dignity, perpetrated moreover against an unfortunate victim who has already been severely enough afflicted."

The American Neurological Association, subsidized by a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, has a committee of distinguished scientists at work in an objective study of sterilization and its social effects. In a report discussed by the New York Times (February 11, 1936) this committee agreed with the British Departmental Committee on Sterilization in concluding that, "consider-ing how little is known about the mechanism of heredity, the time has not yet arrived to weed out supposedly hereditary defectives and that sterilization is scientifically justified only in a few rare, selected cases."

This summary of the American Neurological Association's report must be disheartening to eugenists: "The familiar picture of a race which is degenerating because the mental defectives are outpropagating the rest of us is much too alarming. The hereditary effect in feeble-mindedness cannot be denied; but to argue, as the eugenists do, that we are likely to be swamped by the untypical Nams, Kallikaks and Jukes, is to substitute fear and emotion for science and reason. Properly interpreted, the statistics show that the huge families of the feeble-minded are mythical and that the ever-growing admission to institutions prove nothing because we live longer nowadays and because disease in general is more likely to affect the old than the young. 'Statistical gossip' has taken the place of sound judgment. The selective and therefore the eugenic effects of marriage are generally ignored. What are called 'psychotic individuals' are not as fertile as the general population. Even the feeble-minded breed no more rapidly than the lower and middle classes. Moreover, the death-rate in all forms of mental disease and feeble-mindedness is definitely higher than the average... Before we can legislate the hereditarily unfit out of society, we need facts... Much of the work thus far done on the inheritance of diseases is of questionable scientific validity, with the result that our sterilization laws are based more on a laudable desire to improve humanity than on real knowledge. Particularly important is the relation too often ignored by the eugenists. If diabetes tends to run in families but is nevertheless controlled by means of insulin, is it too much to hope that some of the feeble-minded may be saved through medicine of other external agencies? Ten years and more may elapse before facts are gathered on which a sound legislative policy can be based. But until they are gathered, it is simply folly to place upon the books laws which reflect the good intentions of enthusiasts rather than the findings of sober biologists."

Another objection to the plans of radical eugenics is its open alliance with easy divorce and birth control, the inevitable corollaries of selective breeding.

The impracticability of eugenic control and operation is likewise evident. Sir Arthur Keith, visualizing the theory in the concrete rather than the abstract, writes (l.c.): "The eugenist at once comes up against his first difficulty; the men and women who are willing to submit must be those who are destitute of the most desirable of all human qualities — independence, the urge for individual liberty. Even if he succeeds in assembling a selected community, what kind of men and women would they be that obeyed the dictates of the eugenist? And then, the morality which must pervade such a eugenical establishment. There can be no soft-heartedness on the part of the man in charge; the undesirables have to be ruthlessly weeded out and cast mercilessly aside as soon as detected; mercy and charity become vices in such an establishment."

#### THE EUGENIC ELYSIUM

The case against eugenics is not complete without a survey of its extremes. In A Vision of the Future Richard Marvin Chapman presents a positively weird picture of tomorrow's Utopian state. This Elysium has no homes as we know them today. Children are born in "birth houses." "When the skin of the child is sufficiently tough and a statutory time has expired, the nativity number, omitting the epoch or century, will be indelibly stamped (tattooed) on each side just below the armpit." (P. 24.) Later the eugenic child is moved from the "birth house to the nursery, with varying degrees of elegance and luxury." (P.31.) If, after the eugenic child is born, the eugenic mother does not care to return to her eugenic husband, the statutes of the eugenic state say to her in effect: "My deat, you need not go; stay here. We, the state, will send your child to a place where it will be fed, clothed, trained, and educated by kind and capable teachers, cared for during illness by kind and capable doctors and nurses, and given the happiest and best possible childhood that ample means, kind hearts, and experienced judgment can bestow. As for yourself, you will be assigned to one of the numerous positions of civil service in the birth houses, kindergartens, and other institutions, for which only mothers are eligible, and for the duties of which your training and performance while here have qualified you." (P. 40.) The mother can automatically be freed for subsequent remarriage, although with her new husband she must reimburse the state thereafter for the care of her child, which grows up largely as the ward of the state.

The preparation for marriage will be particularly trying in the eugenic state. Chapman's account of courtship reminds one of examining the pedigree of cows and of reading the verdicts of stock appraisers. We are told: "When finally deciding to be consorts, the young people will exchange identification dockets and memoranda of their respective physicians. The youth and the maid will each take the docket received from the other, and, together with one of their own, they will transmit them to their own birth house with an application for a marriage license. Each of them must procure such license independently of the other... The license will then be transmitted by their respective birth houses to their respective physicians at the addresses given. The bride's license will be sent to her physician, and the groom's license will be sent to his physician, who will both receive them in due course.

"The physicians will then meet, enter into joint consultation, and in each other's presence will be admitted to the lodgings of both bride and groom, where, in a room especially appointed therefor in both of the respective lodgings, the bride and groom will in turn be subjected to a thorough and searching physical examination by both of the physicians simultaneously and jointly." (Pp. 91, 92.) When the whirl of this eugenic life is completed and the new couple have their first child, this amazing procedure is then in order: "When the child is born, both licenses will be returned to the birth house where granted and there canceled. The romance will have turned its full circle and be complete. The father is now free to form a new attachment if he elects to do so, in which case he must repeat the entire procedure and conform to such requirements over again." (P. 98.)

These absurdities are extreme, we readily concede; but they differ only in degree from the premeditated claims of professional eugenists. Frederick W. Seward, M. D., told the Eastern Homeopathic Medical Society: "Ages ago man captured the wild horse. Today we have the delicately formed, fast-running racing horse and other types. We are led to the conclusion that, if man could breed the human race, he could produce definite and pronounced results. He could make a race of giants and another race of pigmies. He could mate individuals with similar pronounced features and produce a race with those pronounced features exaggerated and perfected. He could produce a race of strong men with muscles and another race of wise with brains to plan and discover." (The Making of a New Race, p. 3.)

Prof. H. J. Muller of the University of Texas offers a biologist's prophecy of the future race as controlled by man himself. Professor Muller is a scientist of first rank. Waldemar Kaempffert, describing him in the New York Times, March 15, 1936, says: "It was he who first turned X-rays on the eggs of fruit-flies with results that still daze biologists. At one fell stroke he obtained mutations which gave the doctrine of evolution new meaning. When some future historian contrasts our barbaric twentieth century with his own happy era, he will not stint himself in praising Muller. 'To his monstrous fruit-flies we trace the first deliberate, successful scientific interference with the processes of heredity by external agencies,' he will say of the Texan professor." But Professor Muller is also an ardent disciple of Karl Marx, and it may be that the Marxian ideals of race evolution have distorted his scientific judgment. At least in his Out of the Night he draws a geneticist's picture of the future and declares that "even today only a relatively slight advance [over the Drosophylla fruit-fly experiments] in the technique would be needed to enable us safely and without incision" to transplant the germ of life to women "possessing characters peculiarly excellent." With this advance realized, he exclaims: "How many women in an enlightened community devoid of superstitious tabus and sex slavery would be eager and proud to bear and rear a child of Lenin or Darwin! Is it not obvious that restraint, rather than compulsion, would be called for?"

The daughter of a Yale University neurologist carried these eugenic theories to their ultimate consequences when she took "a young man of good family and good character with the proper eugenic background" and without public marriage made him the father of her eugenic but illegitimate child, Vera.

Dr. Pierre Bertillon of the French Psychopathic Laboratories is quoted in the New York World, November 27, 1926, as suggesting that before any infatuated couple proceeds to the marriage court, they should be required legally to "make a detour by the municipal laboratories to determine scientifically whether their atoms fuse" — to see by scientific tests whether their marriage would be a physiological or a psychological error.

It is with an undisguised feeling of relief that we turn from the vagaries of these eugenic absurdities to the plain sense of duty in matters of health inculcated by the Christian religion. If all the young people of the nation could be brought to understand that by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit their bodies are temples of God, that these sanctuaries must not be profaned, that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the childten unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate God, that those who sow to the flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, this realization of our responsibilities in matters of physical welfare, coupled with the corresponding understanding of our own intimate relation to the bodies of our descendants, would do more than a thousand thousand years of eugenic dreaming.

#### INBREEDING

A closely related subject is consanguineous marriage. In the eighteenth chapter of Leviticus the general rule is laid down: "None of you shall approach [in marriage] to any that is near of kin to him" (v. 6). Then follows a list of prohibited degrees covering forbidden relationship both by blood (consanguinity) and by marriage (affinity). The wisdom and blessing of this moral legislation is apparent, because these incestuous relations, which run counter to all instinctive feelings, are too often characterized by sterility or unfortunate progeny. Little need be said to emphasize the prohibition against these unnatural unions; among all normal young people they condemn themselves. (For a discussion of the forbidden degrees of marriage see Pastoral Theology, by John H. C. Fritz, p. 162 ff.)

The historical observation that inbreeding is tabu among large groups of primitive peoples and that nations in antiquity, from the day of Hammurabi, enacted clean-cut legislation against close intermarriage sweeps away the charge that the antipathy to incest is of Old Testament origin. The stereotyped references to the brother-sister, uncle-niece marriages among the Ptolemies, successors to Alexander the Great as rulers of Egypt and adjacent territory, can by no means justify the approval of incest which ultraliberal sociologists have voiced. When Albert Edward Wiggam (The Fruit of the Family Tree, p. 140) speaks of the Ptolemies (whose genealogical chart shows many brother-sister unions) as "the wonderful family... which furnished illustrious and able rulers for centuries," he is closing his eyes to history. Listen to the verdict of a historian. Prof. Edwyn Bevan of Oxford finds the Ptolemies anything but a "wonderful family." He characterizes the outstanding of the Ptolemies in this way:

Ptolemy I: "Murderer and usurper."

Ptolemy II: "Had many brilliant mistresses, and his court, magnificent and dissolute, intellectual and artificial, has justly been compared with the Versailles of Louis XIV."

Ptolemy IV: "A wretched debauchee, ... murderer of his mother, ... always under the dominion of his favorites, male or female, who indulged his vices."

Ptolemy V: "Cruel, perfidious, tyrannical."

Ptolemy VII: "Of bloated appearance,... a man untouched by natural affection, delighting in deeds of blood, his body as loathsome in its blown corpulence as his soul."

Of much practical importance is an understanding of the principles involved in the marriage of first cousins. No Scriptural statement bans this union; there are, however, in our country these States which prohibit the marriage of first cousins: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, the Dakotas, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, In-diana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina (includes double first cousins only), Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washington, West Virginia (includes double cousins), Wisconsin, Wyoming. (See Russell Sage Foundation Report, Marriage Laws and Decisions in the United States, p. 477.) Cousins who live in these States cannot marry without breaking the laws of their commonwealth. Where no civil impediment exists, the Church raises no protest. Young people who find that their love focuses on their cousins should, however, be acquainted with the following facts:

Studies in the effects of first-cousin marriages stress at least two definite results: First of all, inheritable weaknesses are accentuated in the children born of these unions. Investigations of hereditary lines characterized by deaf-mutism have shown that, though the parents are free of this defect, it may make its appearance in the children of consanguineous marriages because of the deaf-mutism latent in their heredity. (E. Elderton, Marriage of First Cousins.) Dr. Knight Dunlap, professor of experimental psychology in Johns Hopkins University, illustrates this point by references to abnormal mentality. He says: "Feeble-mindedness furnishes a good illustration of the results of breeding. Some of the progeny of the union of a sound and a feeble-minded parent will be sound; but they carry in their germ-cells the 'determinant' of feeble-mindedness and transmit it to a certain proportion of their own progeny. If two persons both of whom carry this determinant mate, the characteristic will reappear in certain of their progeny (that is, some of their children will be feeble-minded) although the characteristic may have been latent for several gen-erations. Obviously parents who both come from feeble-minded stock are more apt to possess this determinant than parents of diverse stock; hence we see the feeble-mindedness reappearing strikingly in certain cases of consanguineous marriages. The situation with regard to other weaknesses is similar." (Personal Beauty and Racial Betterment, pp. 72, 73.)

In addition, infant mortality is greater in consanguineous mar-riages. A table furnished by Elderton places the death-rate for children of first-cousin marriages at 16.7 per cent., while that of non-consanguineous marriages drops to 11.6 per cent.

Biological investigators have tried to answer the practical question as to when ancestral defects make cousin marriage dangerous. They suggest that, if the same defect has not appeared in both lines of descent in three generations, cousins may intermarry with as little fear of having defective children as in any normal union. This statement has, however, not remained unchallenged.

On the other hand, points of strength in first cousins who intermarry are often emphasized in their offspring. A classical illustration is furnished by the remarkable record of the Bach family, which produced many distinguished musicians, in a line of descent featuring many intermarriages. Other notable instances of genealogical lines in which cousin marriages were relatively frequent and successful are found in the family histories of President Benjamin Harrison, Charles Darwin, and the Kembles of Great Britain.

Dr. Charles B. Davenport, head of the department of genetics at the Carnegie Institute of Washington, asserts: "There is no biological reason for concluding that the marriage of cousins in itself will lead to defective offspring.... Numerous and extended researches on the inbreeding of mammals have shown that inbreeding itself is not necessarily harmful. The damage appears to be due to the existence of latent or recessive traits of an undesirable character brought to expression by inbreeding." He concludes with the warning: "The history of mankind is full of the instances of defective offspring from cousins." Dr. George Harrison Shull of Princeton University, who contributed to the symposium on cousin marriages for which Dr. Davenport wrote, feels that the principles reached in the developing of varieties of plants and the breeds of animals are not applicable to human eugenics. He has a much more conservative opinion, holding that there is no reason for altering the present feeling of antipathy against such unions.

It may be stated, in summary, that as the Scriptures pass no judgment on cousin marriages, two young people thus related who have demonstrably healthy antecedents and no hereditary defects may live happily in marriage. But because of the element of uncertainty in the mysteries of heredity it should be clear that some intermarriages of cousins are fraught with dangers, which must not be minimized.

### NO DOLLAR-SIGN MARRIAGES

Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. - Prov. 15:17

A questionnaire recently submitted to the students at a coeducational college asked: "Would of sixty if he or she had a million dollars?" According to the newspaper reports the men answered with a 90-per-cent-plus verdict of no, while 90 per cent of the co-eds chorused an emphatic yes. Just how seriously this eagerness of the women may be taken is, as the estimate of all college questionnaires, somewhat doubtful. Professor Baber has shown (Some Mate Selection Standards of College Students and Their Parents, p. 3) in an investigation embracing a group of 642 college men and women that "economic status is a matter of small concern when it comes to selecting a mate. More than nine tenths of the boys and four fifths of the girls claimed they would show no hesitation in marrying some one with a smaller purse than their own."

Yet a small, determined group of young people regards high financial rating as an absolute prerequisite for happy marriage; and that millions of less determined girls draw a chiaroscuro dream-picture of their prince charming in gold and silver is equally incontestable.

These young women are the products of their age, the victims of our dollar-worshiping environment. The poor girl who marries a multimillionaire, the penniless stenographer whose hand is won by the president of the bank, the prairie school-teacher who finds that her unassuming fiancé owns half of the State of Montana, - these overworked themes are so consistently featured in magazine romances and motion-picture scenarios that we need not seek far afield for the source of this Cinderella motif. In a dream drama enacted in many American girls' hearts the hope of wealth and luxury springs eternal.

This attitude is a flare-back to the highly commercialized marriage of all ancient history or an
importation from Europe. It has slipped through the cordon of that protective moral tariff. Those acquainted with the literature of early Babylonia, cumbersomely recorded on Mesopotamian clay, may have reasons to doubt Herodotus's oft-quoted reference to the bridal market where the unclaimed virgins were auctioned off to the highest bidder; but hundreds of marriage-contract tablets in the early cuneiform leave no doubt that essentially matrimony involved a financial transaction. We read on a tablet from the first Babylonian dynasty, about 2,000 B. C.:

"Zanikbiashu-Shamash, the son of Shamash-re'u, has taken... Titum-ummi, the daughter of Shamash-Nasir, from Shamash-Nasir and (Beltum-Nagish) his wife, in marriage. He will pay ten shekels of silver to Shamash-Nasir, her father, as the bridal price. They have sworn by Shamash, Marduk, ... and Sin-muballit, the king, before [these] witnesses."

This form of marriage was perpetuated for centuries. In effect many brides were married to the highest bidder. A writer complains of his eighteenth-century England: "Our marriages are made, just like other common bargains and sales, by the mere consideration of interest or gain, without any of love or esteem." Nor has this stigma been entirely removed from England since his day. Asking, "What sort of husband can an American girl with, say, about $30,000 a year marry in Europe today?" the Milwaukee Journal (October 22, 1930) answers: "Anything. Literally anything. It is merely a question of what sort of life she desires... Today there are lamentably few English girls with $30,000 a year, but any number of really decent eligible Englishmen with fortunes battered by the war and labor govern-ment, taxation, and the recent death duties. The marriage need not necessarily be wholly mercenary. It is merely an aristocratic maxim that money must come into a family every other generation."

With less éclat the conventional marriage of France and the Standesehe of Germany still lead ambitious parents to arrange marriages for financial convenience and direct their sons and daughters to stifle the impulse of their heart when their head calculatingly asks for matrimonial alliances distinguished by francs or marks.

#### THE PROTEST AGAINST DOLLAR-SIGN

MARRIAGES

A saner attitude has voiced its protest in our country. Occasionally we read of declassé young women using the spring-board of publicity to dive into public attention by offering themselves in marriage to any one who will make a prenuptial settlement of, say, $5,000, allegedly for the benefit of an unemployed father or an inty in a guestionable fringe representing the subscribe as to the professional marriage bureaus, where almost every letter stresses an expected inheritance, a bank deposit, a 160-acre farm, or other attractive assets. Clean-thinking young people, however, have learned to regard money as a secondary consideration. A questionnaire, answered by about 5,000 Lutheran young men and women in various sections of the United States, asking for the specifications of "an ideal helpmate" revealed that of the young men who answered, only 5 per cent made any reference to the desirability of marrying a wife with a large income. On the other hand, most of the answers submitted by the girls asked for "a moderate in-come" or "an adequate salary." Some set their requirements higher and wanted "enough money to live comfortably" or stated that "he must own his home" or "that he must have a substantial bank account." Only 5.5 per cent demanded that their future husband be "a man of means."

This emphatic "thumbs down" on large dowries and bulging bank books as the supremely desirable quality strikes a sympathetic response in the hearts of those who believe in love for love's sake. Most of us feel the thrill of loyalty which distinguished a twenty-six-year-old Philadelphian. He married the young lady of his choice, although he thereby forfeited $180,000 which an abstemious uncle had bequeathed to him on the condition that he remain unmarried until his thirty-fifth birthday. "What's $180,000 compared with the girl you love?" he asked inquiring reporters. The voice of true devotion answers: "Nothing, absolutely nothing!" We pay similar tribute to a Cleveland girl who announced her intention to spurn a fortune of $175,000 which she was to inherit when she married a designated young man. She persisted in her choice, however, and made the straightforward declaration: "I am in love with a young man in Cleveland, and all the money in the world doesn't tempt me."

#### THE PERILS OF MONEY-MINDEDNESS

The Christian protest against this attitude is based upon the obvious lesson of life that the desire for money, merely for its own sake, is always dangerous. A basic truth both of human experience and of Scriptural revelation warns us: "They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition" (1 Tim. 6:9). If wealth were the key to happiness, we would be entitled to search for the sublimest earthly felicity in the lives of the wealthiest. Those who believe that the road to contentment is paved with gold should read the confession of this modern Croesus, an anonymous multimillionaire, who admitted in a popular magazine: "The most disillusioned men I know are those millionaires who dreamed there was a connection between ability to buy and desire to have and, on waking, found that the power to satisty appetite destroyed it. . . Here am I, for instance, only a shade over fifty years of age, wondering how I can make tomorrow different from yesterday. I have been what is called a multimillionaire since the war and have acquired the full set of precious or expensive things my kind collects — villas in Palm Beach and Aiken, shooting-lodges where the game flies free, a town house in New York, one of those ornate mansions on the Sound, an apartment on the Champs Elysées, a parterre box in the Metropolitan, many of Duveen's old masters and Baum-garten's period furniture, together with automobiles, motor-boats, and other paraphernalia of great wealth. Add to these assets a well-mannered, presentable wife, two girls and a boy who sowed their wild oats without discommoding me, and you have the picture of this narrator, blessed with every recognized appurtenance of happiness — and bored to death."

In his biography of Frank D. Munsey entitled Forty Years — Forty Millions, George Britt quotes the multimillionaire publisher as saying: "Now my life — I feel that in some ways it has been a failure. I'll give you three reasons. I have no heirs. I am dis appointed in my friendships. And I have no clear views on the great religious problems. The idea of marriage, I have come to believe, is to produce an heir to represent you, to step into your shoes after you are gone. I have no heir to represent me. When I was a young man, the girls I proposed to wouldn't have me; they thought I was too poor and never would be able to support them properly. Today I have forty million dollars; but what has it brought me? Not happiness. Where can I leave it?" Even with his forty millions Mr. Munsey did not have the true meaning of the happiness of marriage.

Other plutocrats have been woefully poor in the things that make life worth while. William N. Wood, president of the American Woolen Company, received a yearly salary of more than $1,000,000; yet he committed suicide on his baronial Daytona, Florida, estate. It is not long since Miss Ella Wendell, last of her family, died, leaving an immense fortune estimated at more than $100,000,000. Surely, one might conclude, the mistress of this fabulous estate would have been supremely and securely happy. But here is the picture the New York Tribune draws of Miss Wendell in her $10,000,000 home on Fifth Avenue: "At nightfall, when the Avenue was gay with lights and motor-cars, but no ficker of light came from the somber mansion at Thirty-ninth Street, Miss Ella would steal out with Tobey (a poodle) through the side door and walk sedately in the garden, her wide black skirts fluttering over her old-fashioned button boots, her thin, yellow fingers clutching his leash.... There was no telephone in the house, and the doors were never opened when the bell was rung. The blinds were constantly drawn, and dust lay thick in the window chinks. Electric light, modern plumbing, the radio, and the gramophone were innovations that the Wendells ignored."

In studied protest against the deteriorating influences of money, Dr. W. W. Mayo chose as the scene of his medical practice not one of the large cities of our country, but Rochester, Minnesota, believing that, as Nazareth was big enough for the Great Healer, this hamlet, free from social distraction, would be large enough for him. His ideals of service were perpetuated by his two internationally renowned sons, Dr. William J. and Charles H. Mayo. When their surgical skill was rewarded by enticing financial returns, they refused to keep this wealth but established in 1915 the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research at the University of Minnesota. Since that time more than 2,000 young students have received fellowships and financial aid from the endowment. The two physicians were moved by a recognition of the destructive influences of luxury and unearned money; and in the spirit of humanitarian service they laid down these principles: "It seemed to us that moneys which accumulate over and above the amount necessary for our families would interfere seriously with the object we had in view. Money is so likely to encourage waste of time, changing the objectives of life, living under conditions which put one out of touch with those who have been lifelong friends, perhaps less fortunate in material things. How many families have we seen ruined by money, which has taken away from the younger members the desire to labor and achieve and has introduced elements into their lives whereby, instead of becoming useful citizens, they have become wasteful and sometimes profligate."

Particularly in marriage does financial overemphasis show its ugly consequences. To convince oneself that the wealthiest people, far from being the most happily married, are often the most un-fortunate, one need but investigate the divorce lists of the nation. The frequency with which the names of the rich are found in the register of the legally separated is beyond all proportion.

In marriages of great financial disparity, money questions often act as a boomerang. The young woman, dazzled by the glitter of gold, may later, in moments of irate disturbance, be accused of marrying only for money; just as the self-confident but financially restricted young man who makes the mistake of entering a dollar-sign marriage with an heiress may find that he has not only sold his self-respect and his masculine independence but has also dropped in public estimation into the class of the fortune-hunter.

#### THE BETTER WAY

The truth of the Scriptural estimate "Riches are not forever" (Prov. 27:24) has been indelibly impressed upon this generation by the financial debacle that began in October, 1929, and that within three years provoked the closing of 5,000 banks and a loss of $72,000,000,000 in the value of the securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

However, some assets remain unaffected by depressions. Cultural and intellectual acquirements, for example, do not fluctuate with bull and bear markets. The young woman who, casting about for quick money, permits her choice to fall on an officer in an investment company in preference, say, to a struggling assistant at a small college, overlooks the fact that the college course, of which the incipient broker may be quite innocent, normally has a cash value in ultimate earning capacity. Entirely aside from his contributions of culture the university man with average application should eventually be the better provider over a period of years.

Spiritual resources, intangible and beyond computation as they are, should be accorded first consideration. By no miracle of social or financial alchemy can a girl reared under Christian influences and pledged to the Christian faith find any lasting happiness in a marriage even to millions that requires the compromise or the denial of her faith. Retinues of servants, a fleet of Rolls-Royces, a wardrobe of fur wraps, a king's ransom in jewels, easy entrée into the inner circle of élite society, cannot silence the insistent voice of conscience nor utterly dissipate the vision of a Savior sold, Judaslike, for gold. Conversely, in any marriage where Christian faith is accorded its rightful priority there is a power for good beyond the purchase price of accumulated wealth, — a divine insurance against the matrimonial shipwreck suffered by those who set sail without the heavenly Pilot and with no other goal than a life of luxury and self-indulgence.

It was my pleasure to assist at an interesting wedding at which the groom was one of our young American business men, the bride a native of Australia. They had met under unusual circumstances on the Queen Mary; before the voyage was over, their acquaintance had developed into friendship and, during the succeeding weeks, into love. When the hopeful aspirant declared himself for the young lady's hand, he had to put his petition in a letter addressed to the bride-to-be's father in Sydney. Now, this Australian parent had never seen the young man who was to be his son-in-law, and with 12,000 miles of land and sea separating them, there was no time and facility for personal interview. So he wrote a series of letters which showed an exemplary consideration and interest. Particularly meaningful, after the discussion of morality, health, and religion, was the father's question: "Are you in a position to support a wife in suitable comfort?" By way of explanation he wrote: "I do not place great store upon riches; I prefer a simple mode of life. Happily I have been privileged to afford my family a comfortable home and all the little amenities of life, such as a maid to do the housework, suitable attire, amusements, and a car to run about in. Now, I do not expect a young man to start in where I have left off, but it is important that a young girl should be comfortably situated. I appreciate the fact that you are quite frank as to your present earnings, which in our money would be — pounds a week. This is modest enough and will mean going along very quietly, as a man must live within his means, have enough for his wants and a little to spare. Do your future prospects entitle you to anticipate increased earning power from time to time?"

In the same homely, every-day wisdom of inspired truth the master of Old Testament proverbs assures us: "Better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith than an house full of sacrifices with strife" (Prov. 17:1). "Better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith. Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith" (Prov. 15:16, 17). How remarkably experience has corroborated this better way! To marry at a reasonable minimum; to enjoy the cooperative effort of striving; to see the seeds of thrift blossom forth into the full flower of a happy home, — this has been the experience of uncounted young couples who have been satisfied with humble, sometimes even arduous, beginnings. The early struggles have welded them much more closely together than any effortless career could have done. They appreciate by personal understanding the deeper, sturdier qualities which, if they are not emphasized by sacrifices, may never find occasion for full expression and become atrophied. Appreciation comes through the effort of acquisition. The wife who knows what money means and can measure the effort which it represents will think twice before she spends a single dollar unnecessarily; but the wife who has been pampered by indulgent parents can neither rightly estimate the moderate earning of her financially less-favored husband nor ordinarily make the intricacies of the restricted family budget balance. She misses the thrill of pioneer partnership, which believes in present sacrifice for future happiness.

When the Golden Rule Foundation selected Mrs. Carl R. Gray of Omaha, Nebraska, as the "American Mother of 1937," this choice met with wide and enthusiastic endorsement. She would, so she is quoted, "include in the bill of rights of every child the privilege of Christian parentage, to be born of a Christian father and a Christian mother, who, knowing the will of God and living it, would thus create together a Christian home, a home dominated and enriched by human love, a sure and safe harbor of peace and joy." Definite Christian principles have guided her from her childhood; and her Christian zeal is shown by the fact that for many years she has taught Sunday-school lessons both in her church in Omaha and over the radio. Modern young people, however, will be interested in the fact that she married Carl R. Gray (who later became president of the Union Pacific Railroad) when she was seventeen years old, and he was only two years her senior. To her young husband, then employed as a telegraph operator, she said that though she had full confidence that one day he would be a railroad president, her deepest ambition for him was to help give him "the happiest home in the world." And on their wedding-day their total assets and combined resources were less than five dollars!

#### PREMARRIAGE FINANCES

This advice should not be misinterpreted as a sweeping denunciation of every marriage in which either the bride or the groom has more. No other rules of life are subject to as many exceptions and qualifications as the broad principles of marriage; and where love is ready to bear and to share, there the impediment of divergent financial rating, as dangerous as it may be, can be overcome.

Neither does the Church advocate indifference to the stark realities of finances. While the importance of money in marriage should not be overestimated, a protest must be voiced against the plunging headlong into the responsibilities of matrimony with inadequate resources or even with heavy debts. The idea that two will live as cheaply as one can be realized only by a domestic miracle. The Iowa Old Age Assistance Commission has discovered that at best two can live as cheaply as only 1.7. Few spectacles in matrimonial experiences are more disillusionizing than these hasty, care-free unions that soon send a destitute couple back to the parental roof, to the pawn-shop door, or to the community funds. The awakening to the hard reality of life is tragic testimony to the folly of financial imprudence.

Vice-Chancellor Francis B. Davis of the New Jersey Circuit Court sums up the warning of his judiciary experience in the epigrammatic "Don't risk wrecking happiness by marrying on insufficient income." (Philadelphia Public Bulletin, August 25, 1932.)

In St. Louis, Circuit Judge Wilson A. Taylor, reviewing more than a quarter of a century's activities on the bench as arbiter in divorce proceedings, reflects (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 18, 1933): "There's no hard and fast rule for a happy marriage. But I think there are two essentials — true love and the ability of the husband to provide a living income.... Often the young wife who gave up her position when she got married finds her husband's earnings won't go far enough. Then quarrels begin, and they often are the storm signals which lead to permanent discord."

When the inevitable question arises: "How much must we have before we can marry?" it is difficult to propose a schedule of salaries and savings accounts which can be regarded as a safe minimum. A few years ago a Western bank strongly counseled its employees not to marry until their annual income reached $1,500. Today married couples can find happiness on a markedly lower basis But the minimum should be large enough to provide not only for bare existence but also for emergencies, the growth of the family, cultural and recreational advantages, participation in the work of the Church, and a financial reserve. If a girl is not sure that a young man can provide her with this minimum, she should hesitate before accepting him. That decision can be postponed until, either with the addition of her earnings or through improved employment prospects, a more adequate financial basis may be secured or safely anticipated. While the proverbial exit of love through the window upon the entrance of poverty may be a libel on the unbroken devotion of Christians, who are ready to share sickness, sorrow, and poverty without the diminution of their affection, nevertheless destitution and privation, when the result of improvident premarital planning, often serve as domestic dynamite.

Financial requirements must not, however, be raised to forbidding heights. The girl who insists that she will not marry until her husband is able to provide the comfort she enjoys at home and who starts the scale of her demands on the level of parental luxury may rob herself of some of the strongest character-building experiences in life, the thrill of struggle, acquisition, and accomplish-ment. The young couple that sets itself a goal of savings which can be reached only by the employment of the wife, the postponement of childbirth, and the restriction of home development may find that it has worshiped too long at the golden calf to enjoy happiness in the fine art of living together.

#### EXTRAVAGANCE IN COURTSHIP

Financial wisdom must be shown in the days of courtship. Albert W. Beaven, who investigated these premarriage finances, reports in the Young People's Leader: "M, inquiries developed some rather startling figures on the cost to the average young man of his friendship with girls. One young man estimated that it was not possible for him to take a girl out and get back home for less than two dollars and forty cents an evening, and if it were a formal affair, the cost might run from ten to fifteen dollars. If he went with a girl and did not take her to the formal things that came in her set, he was looked upon as cheap. And yet he said: 'I do not earn over twenty-five dollars a week, and the girl knows it. "

Prof. Ernest R. Groves of the University of North Carolina, in his recent Marriage (a volume designed to be a college text-book on matrimony), discusses the courtship cost on the basis of data supplied by men and women of several universities. In his chapter on the "Problems of Courtship" he lists the expenses of one Vassar girl who reported the following outlay in preparation for a special evening's entertainment: Train fare, $12.00; taxis and tips, $2.00; meal on train, $1.75; shampoo, wave, manicure, $5.00; evening dress, $195.00; evening wrap, $275.00; slippers, $37.00; stockings, $4.50; gloves, $6.50; bag, $20.00; telegrams and telephone, 75 cts. Total, $559.50. Excellent fuel for communist fires!

More modest are the figures of a student at the University of North Carolina, who budgets his courtship expenses as follows: About two shows a week, $1.60; gasoline a week, about $2.00; drug-store treats a week, 50 cts.; occasional trip (once every two months), $10.00 to $25.00; occasional play or athletic event, $5.00 to $6.00.

Estimates of this sort appear quite absurd in the light of the present financial conditions. The vast majority of young people in college or out of college have no funds of these proportions at their disposal. This year Federal Aid was extended to 87,866 students, with a maximum allowance of $15 a month for the undergraduate or $30 for the graduate student. Officials at the University of Nebraska, who made a cross-section study of student finances for the school-year of 1932-33, found that 45 per cent of all men and 25 per cent of all women students were either wholly or partly self-supporting. A 1936 University of Wisconsin report touching upon student finances states that almost 60 per cent of the 9,000 young people enrolled at Madison are wholly or partly earning their way through the four years of their educational program. Even the few college men and women able to raise sums like those revealed in Professor Grove's findings often sacrifice the finest part of courtship happiness under the artificiality of this lavish outlay.

#### PRACTICAL PROBLEMS

Never before have financial matters played such a large role in the marriage of young people as in the last decade.

Two million young people, we are told, want to get married, but cannot afford to. One of these young men complains to a statistician: "I belong to a lost generation. When I was graduated from college in 1930, I couldn't find a job. I haven't got one yet. There doesn't seem to be any place for me. In ordinary times I ought to be well on the way to a successful career, building a home and rearing a family. But here I am at loose ends. I am in love. I want to get married. But how can I? My father at my age was married and had two children." (American Magazine, June, 1934, p. 92.) And soon afterwards a young woman brings the parallel lament: "I have been knocking around, trying to find the work for which I am really fitted, ever since my graduation, three years ago. I was trained to be a research assistant, but the only work I have been able to get has been an elementary clerical job in an office and later as saleswoman in a large department store. Now I am on a PWA white-collar job, and I am glad to have it. Father is out of work, and my small pay helps the family. I have a nice fiancé, but I cannot possibly marry under these conditions." (L. c.)

In some instances discretion may dictate marriage with a simple ceremony, a modest flat, and a minimum of outlay for household equipment. Under other circumstances it may be in place to advise young people to find a temporary expedient in living under the same roof with their parents, although this must always be regarded as an emergency measure. Again, the best counsel will often point to the heroic course of foregoing the happiness of marriage until conditions offer a definite improvement. The last course is the most difficult and places a tremendous hardship upon the youth of our day, one to which their parents were not subjected.

According to a survey by the National Resources Commission (October, 1938), which analyzed the incomes of 21,419,000 families in the United States, "14 per cent of all families received less than $500 during the years studied; 42 per cent received less than $1,000, 65 per cent less than $1,500, and 87 per cent less than $2,500." Above this $2,500 figure, the report continues, "there were about 10 per cent with incomes up to $5,000, about 2 per cent receiving between $5,000 and $10,000, and only 1 per cent with incomes of $10,000 and more." The unequal distribution of wealth is further emphasized by the claim that the 42 per cent of the families (almost one half) whose income is below $1,000 annually receive less than 16 per cent of the total American family income, while the 3 per cent in the brackets of $5,000 or more receive 21 per cent of the total. Even more graphic is the assertion that the 1 per cent of the families with annual incomes of $10,000 or more enjoys 13 per cent of our total family incomes. Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of all is the revelation that the lower third of the nation's families had an average annual net income of only $471 during the year of 1935-1936. Seventy per cent of this group were not on the Federal relief rolls!

#### SECRET MARRIAGE - AND WORSE

Fundamentally objectionable, from whatever angle it is viewed, is the secret marriage. In combating economic obstacles, it happens with increasing frequency that short-sighted, selfish young people elope to a near-by marriage market, pay a grasping justice of the peace an extra fee to insure secrecy, and then return to their separate homes as man and wife. This arrangement permits the wife to maintain her employment in concerns where married women are eliminated; it obviates the necessity of any expenditure for household equipment and makes the marriage a definite fact. But opposed to these benefits are these serious and decisive objections: Run-away, secret marriage is a desecration of a holy relationship, an insult to the Christian pastor, and a heedless disregard of the parents. The secrecy which this relationship imposes is dishonorable, since it creates false impressions, and uncomfortable, since it necessitates the concealment of a fact which young people normally are proud and eager to publish. Its suppressed, clandestine character will ultimately work hardship and produce disillusionment. The secret ceremony, in plain terms, is a misrepresentation, a public deceit, and a thoroughly unfair and unfortunate beginning.

Few deceptions are worse; but the border-line of the most generous morality is ruthlessly transgressed in John Hyde Preston's "Love among the Ruins" (Harper's Magazine, July, 1934), where he states that in consequence of financial stringency young people who cannot find the means for marriage are casting all thoughts of right and wrong to the heedless winds and living together without the wedding ceremony. The moral outlook of this author has dropped so low that he can extol these without-the-law relationships for "their sincerity and willingness to struggle."

Amid these glaring concessions to a loose spirit of our age the Christian survey of life offers hope and strength of character to young people who find themselves torn between the desire for marriage and the difficulty of money matters. These Christian standards never permit of compromise with any unworthy proposals. They never countenance the end-justifies-the-means policy, but they are always emphatic in their confdence of God's eftectual help. Trusting in Heaven's guidance, young people may be obliged to wait for the fulfilment of their marriage dreams; but if they are loyal in the profession of their faith, they can rest with the conviction that in God's time and by His direction they will be brought together for a lifelong, joy-filled union.

### THE I. Q. FOR HAPPY MARRIAGES

Wisdom — more precious than rubies - Prov. 3:15

One day Doctor Samuel Johnson happened to discuss with his faithful biographer, Boswell, the merits of cultural attainments in marriage. So thoroughly did Boswell disagree with the great lexicographer that he wrote this résumé of the discussion: "Johnson maintained to me, contrary to the common opinion, that a woman would not be the worst wife for being learned; in which from all that I have observed... I humbly differed from him. That a woman should be sensible and well informed I allow to be a great advantage; but I think that Sir Thomas Overbury in his rude versification has very judiciously pointed out that degree of intelligence which is to be desired in a female companion:

"Give me, next god, an understanding wife By nature wise, not learned by much art."

Since the day of Johnson and Boswell, as before, this debate on brains in marriage has continued. On one hand, there are the enthusiastic anti-intelligence agitators, who decree that mental training spoils a wife and makes her less capable of fulfilling her various matronly duties. For instance, among the qualifications of an ideal wife listed in the Gentlemen's Magazine of 1761, when Dr. Johnson was at the height of his influence, we find among other interesting requisites, these remarkable demands:

"A decent share of common sense, just tinctured with a little seasonable repartee and a small modicum of wit; but no learning (either ancient or modern), I say again and again, upon any consideration whatever.

"Well, but not critically, skilled in her own tongue.

"A proper knowledge of accounts and arithmetic, but no sort of skill in fractions.

"An acquaintance with domestic news, but no acquaintance with foreign.

"No enthusiasm for the guitar."

Champions of similar blissful ignorance are with us today in no small numbers. They may not go to the extremes advocated by Philippe de Novaire, in the thirteenth century, the very heyday of the Middle Ages, who, voicing wide-spread contemporaneous opinion, seriously maintained that girls should not be taught to read. (Crump and Jacob, The Legacy of the Middle Ages, p. 405.) By stressing the biological side of marriage, emphasizing the disproportionately large numbers of women graduates and school-teachers who shun matrimony, and pointing to the predominance of divorce in élite circles with all their cultural advantages, those who would restrict the intellectual development of women have succeeded in presenting a case against "brainy" marriages. Count Leo Tolstoy used to refer to a half-wit in his village as the ideal woman. She was a docile creature who never intruded in any one's business. What else could be desired in a woman? his philosophy of life implied. His daughter records (The Tragedy of Tolstoy, p. 73) that, when a friend of the Russian novelist voiced her indignation at the selection of this simple-minded woman as the feminine acme, Tolstoy challenged: "And what does a woman need intelligence for?"

On the other hand, there have always been those who agree with Doctor Johnson that married life is improved by the wife's intellectual training. In our own day we have been so thoroughly converted to the necessity of similar education for both sexes that, according to the Statistical Abstract of the United States, there were 52,103 more girls than boys in the secondary schools of the nation in 1934. In our universities and colleges three women received a degree to every four men. With the significant exception of Harvard University, all notable law and medical schools are open to women.

Because of the unparalleled facilities of popular education and the increasing extent to which they are employed, the questions become more acute: Is the acceptance of these educational opportunities detrimental to happiness in marriage? Is there an intelligence quotient (I.Q.) for full marital happiness?

#### ONE-SIDED GENIUS

Some fundamental truths, we believe, will help us approach a specific answer. First of all, we may remind ourselves that genius and domesticity are sometimes irreconcilable opposites. In English literature we have the significant examples of Addison and the Countess of Warwick, Lord Bacon and Miss Barnham, Dryden and Lady Howard, Byron and Miss Milbanke, Shelley and Miss Westbrook, Milton and his two wives, Dickens and Miss Hogarth, Lord Bulwer-Lytton and Miss Wheeler. These and many other literati, like Ben Jonson, Sir Thomas Moore, Steele, and Sterne, emphasize the frequency with which genius and domesticity are at swords' points.

This list could be extended to great lengths, especially if the fields of the other arts were investigated; for men and women of applauded genius are frequently too self-absorbed and too assiduously courted by public glamor to be conscious of the duties imposed by marriage and the limitations set by parenthood. There is also a certain one-sidedness to many brilliant lives, by which they become poorly balanced, supersensitive on one side and adamant on the other.

Genius has often felt itself exempted from the ordinary claims of morality. Chopin and his relations with Madame Dudevant, more familiarly known by her literary pseudonym, George Sand, provoked a large literature. Franz List and his association with Madame la Comtesse d'Agault, known in literary circles as Daniel Stern, his unmarried wife, mother of his three children, aroused a storm of discussion until the composer permitted Cardinal Hohen-lohe to ordain him into the Franciscan Order. Lord Byron's wife left him within a year after their marriage because of his loose passions. Carlyle treated his wife with less civility than he extended to the servants. At times he refused to speak to her for weeks. She was not permitted to travel in the same carriage with him and was gradually neglected in favor of other women. Yet at her death he had a beautiful inscription carved on her tomb-stone, although people believed that "had she lived, he would have tormented her afresh." (Hyslop, Great Abnormalities, p. 54.) Bulwer-Lytton was torn between alternate fits of depression and fiery temper. He once bit his wife on the left cheek and at another time kicked her savagely. Richard Wagner was described to a coast-to-coast audience by Deems Taylor, music commentator for the Columbia Broadcasting System, in these lines: "An endless procession of women marched through his life. His first wife spent twenty years forgiving his infidelities. His second wife had been the wife of his most devoted friend, from whom he stole her. And even while he was trying to persuade her to leave her first husband, he was writing to a friend to inquire whether the friend could suggest some wealthy woman — any wealthy woman — whom he could marry for her money." There seems to be more than a grain of truth in Schopenhauer's confession: "People of genius are not only unpleasant in practical life but weak in moral sense and wicked." — It is perhaps well, then, that there are only 400 geniuses in all history, according to the criteria of Dr. Charles C. Hurst of Cambridge, England

#### COLLEGE TRAINING, DOMESTIC ASSET OR LIABILITY?

A more important issue is the question, What influence does a modern college education exert on marriage? Any process of purely mental enlightenment should in itself contribute to the increase of home happiness. A college training should make for a widened appreciation of life's verities, a tolerant attitude toward others, and, introspectively, a consciousness of one's own limitations. Under the inner building impulses of Christian education these radiations are genuine and unmistakable.

Many will agree with Mary A. Hewitt, dean of women at Marquette University: "The cultural training a girl receives in college enables her to appreciate the things on which a finer home life is founded." The recent centennial of women's higher learning in America reminded us that in its original conception the early plans for the education of American women paid special attention to the domestic arts. The Oberlin College catalog for 1835 has this to say about entrance requirements:

"Young ladies of good mind, unblemished morals, and respectable attainments are received into this department and placed under the superintendence of a judicious lady, whose duty it is to correct their habits and mold the female character.

"They board at the public table and perform the labor of the steward's department, together with the washing, ironing, and much of the sewing of the students."

These rules were enacted for the young women at Mount Holyoke College in 1837: "No young lady shall become a member of Mount Holyoke Seminary who cannot kindle a fire, wash potatoes, repeat the multiplication table and at least two thirds of the shorter catechism. Every member of the school shall walk a mile a day unless a freshet, earthquake, or some other calamity prevent. No young lady shall devote more than an hour a day to miscellaneous reading. No young lady is expected to have gentleman acquaintances, unless they are returned missionaries or agents of benevolent societies."

The higher education of women has changed considerably since those Spartan days. While we may answer the criticism of Esther Everstandt Brooke, vocational-guidance counselor (in Good House-keeping, September, 1933): "The college woman who succeeds in business today owes her alma mater very little thanks. She is the victim of one of the most perfect systems of unpreparedness and misguidance ever devised," by the rebuttal that many girls do not attend college in order to prepare for business, we cannot thus lightly dismiss the charge that the four college years sometimes lead directly away from an intelligent appreciation of Christian home life.

The girl who has specialized or four years in political economy gives no guaranty that she is equipped for the successful regulation of the affairs of the home. A husband who has gained distinctions in his architectural studies may lack the practical wisdom required for building his own dwelling along lines of lasting value, just as more than one M. D. is unable to render his own household immune to the contagion of domestic ills. Courses on plant morphology, principles of marketing, quantitative analysis, gravimetrics, the writing of the one-act play, Vergil's Eclogs and Georgics, integral calculus, Newtonian dynamics, - these at best affect parental qualities only to an incidental extent. We do not share the claim of a New York elevator-manufacturer who would burn all colleges for women (even including his former exception, Bryn Mawr, which had been excluded from the academic conflagration until he learned that a number of young women at that institution smoked). He told the faculty at Bryn Mawr: "A child born of a woman who has been to college should be taken from the mother as soon as weaned and placed in some institution where it could be properly cared for." But how far from the truth is he when, commenting on a newspaper announcement of the institute at Smith College which is "to reconcile a normal life of marriage and motherhood with a life of intellectual activity," he declares: "To make women normal again after they have spent four years at college, studying psychoanalysis, inferiority complexes, the hereness of the there and the wentness of the gone, is an impossibility"!

A college course that makes marriage merely a temporary arrangement, that glorifies divorce, exalts childless families, and preaches the emancipation of the wife from domestic duties; or any cultural course in which Christianity is attacked, the Bible ridiculed, our Savior caricatured, or the conviction of our faith attacked, even by innuendo, is a satanic device that will shatter the joy of happy marriage into irreparable fragments.

#### AVOID EDUCATIONAL GULFS!

Full companionship is often impossible when a husband is a college graduate and the wife's assets are only physical. Not only will this disparity rule out the mutual enjoyment of good books, music, art, the intelligent discussion of current affairs, but the lack of adequate education may prove a handicap even in the practical affairs of home-life, the rearing of children, and the solution of domestic problems. When ominous shadows lengthen over the home, the uncultured husband of a cultured wife often stands by as a helpless spectator, unable to offer what God and man expect of him.

John Wesley married a middle-aged, wealthy widow with four children, Mrs. Vazeille, a former servant girl, who had little interest in his intellectual life and less understanding of his problems. This mental breach inevitably produced a tragedy from which Wesley suffered for thirty years. Rankling hatred took complete possession of Mrs. Wesley. On occasion she rose up while her husband was preaching in London to ridicule him publicly. At other times she resorted to libel and forgery to besmirch his character and ruin his career. A friend of Wesley is reported to have said to his son: "Jack, I was once in the north of Ireland; I went into a room and found Mrs. Wesley foaming with fury. Her husband was on the floor, wher she had been trailing him by the hair of his head; and she herselt was still holding in her hand venerable locks which she had plucked up by the roots. I felt as though I could have knocked the soul out of her." (Quoted from a private manuscript in Diamond's Psychology of the Methodist Revival, pp. 69, 70.)

The situation may become similarly acute when the wife has enjoyed a superior education. While these pages were written, glaring newspaper head-lines told us of an Illinois college graduate, instructor at an agricultural school, who killed his wife and confessed that he did it because she was "socially and intellectually his superior," although both had been graduated from the same university.

This is abnormal; yet many a young woman who has earned the privilege of placing an A. M. or a Ph. D. after her name learns that academic appendages may jeopardize the winning of the matrimonial prefix. John Kirk Folsom, Vassar College sociologist, asserts that "men usually marry downward intellectually." In substantiation he calls attention to a California study in which the average I. Q. of the husbands was found to be eight points higher than that of the wives. Consequently, he concludes, "finding a mate is particularly difficult for highly educated women." Dr. William Robinson, honorary surgeon of the Sunderland Royal Infirmary, insists that a university degree handicaps the marriage probabilities of a girl about 50 per cent.

It is a serious issue, this appeal for a common educational basis. In the flush of eager excitement when young people are momentarily captivated by appearance or popularity, they may overstress physical charm or social applause; yet next to complete spiritual unity mental compatibility is one of the strongest pledges for unalloyed happiness.

Here, too, the ennobling power of Christian faith can exert its blessed influence. Before Michael Faraday fell in love, at the age of thirty, he had made his epochal discoveries in the field of magnetic current. Within two years he would be recognized as one of the world's leading scientists; and his affection fixed itself upon a simple girl who sat in the pew next to his in the chapel where he worshiped every Sunday. Despite educational differences they really "lived happily ever afterward." A Christian woman, gifted with common sense, humility, and understanding, made a happy home for "the greatest scientific experimenter the world has ever seen," to use John Tyndall's tribute to Faraday.

#### DON'T STOP STUDYING!

When the master of proverbs exalts wisdom, spirit-seeking, truth-promoting knowledge, and declares it to be "more precious than rubies" (Prov. 3:15), he is not indulging in oratorical com-parisons. He means exactly what he says, namely, that the acquisition of sound, God-fearing wisdom is a better asset than a treasure-trove filled with pigeon-blood rubies. Crown jewels may be plundered, diamonds melted, brittle emeralds broken, but nothing short of insanity or accident can destroy the treasures of accumulated reading, study, and culture.

That sage of the Old Testament, devoting verse upon verse to the exaltation of wisdom, continues and declares: "Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding is it established" (Prov. 24:3); and these inspired epigrams entitle us to conclude that Christian culture can brighten the rich glow of a happy home. There may be, of course, a rare companionship even in those homes where a sixth-grade education marks the upper limit of school attendance, provided the spiritual walls are stout and strong. A Gemutlichkeit, that untranslatable German synonym of happy serenity, may radiate its cheering comfort from that hearthstone, while the modish apartments of high-strung savants reverberate with the crash of family conflicts. But any Christian home will be the richer and the happier for every added measure of culture with which it is endowed. True education offers new contacts, varied points of view, a softer insistence, a more charitable interpretation, a sense of cooperative living, and altogether the wider panorama of a more abundant life.

By the development of latent talents and the pursuit of cultural advancement forward-looking young people can often make a notable contribution to the happiness of their later home-life. This truth will be conceded because it is based on Scripture and common experience. The difficulty lies in an altogether difterent sphere and is voiced in the question: "How can we carry on and continue an educational program in the face of these disheartening years?"

In the midst of the greatest educational era that any country in any age has ever enjoyed, tens of thousands of splendid young people have not been able to accept the opportunities of a college education because of financial stress. Since there may be personal disappointment in the hearts of some readers who were obliged to go to work after graduation from high school or to drop out of college after the freshman or sophomore year I give them these words of encouragement.

If you are eager to continue your education, believing that a college degree would be a stimulus to your intellectual growth and indirectly a contribution to your future home-life, remember that you can reach this goal even though you may be employed — or unemployed. In addition to the opportunities afforded by evening schools, many representative colleges and universities have built up a splendid system of extension and home-study courses, designed especially to meet the requirements of those for whom personal attendance at college is impossible. This program is carried out under the auspices of the National University Association. The instruction is given by correspondence, sometimes supplemented by the radio, and is usually designed for the individual, although groups have been organized into voluntary classes. Many of the schools permit the students to take one half of the four years' course in this extension work, while some give credit for as much as two thirds. Most of the students take two or perhaps three courses a year, since it has been found that it is not advisable for employed students to enroll for more work. Young people who are not working can in a single year earn thirty-two hours' credit or the full year's rating. The courses offered embrace practically all the major subjects taught in the wide field of American education today, and almost all the courses listed in the regular curriculum are open to home students.

This plan has met with wide acceptance. The 1938 annual convention of the National Extension Association, representing fifty member universities, reported more than 200,000 individual students enrolled in college and high-school extension and correspondence courses.

Enrolment does not restrict one to an arduous, every-night routine of study. That price might be too high even for the benefits of education. A systematic planning of one's leisure or unemployed time will show that the twenty-four-hour daily schedule which God has given every one of us can be arranged by simple efficiency plans to allow for this extra cultural effort. Prof. A. R. Lauer of the department of psychology at Iowa State College feels that college students can save seven hours a week merely by following mechanical rules in their reading and recording. He requires, for example, that students force themselves to read faster, that they make an effort "to see phrases rather than words." If, as he claims, thirty-six days may be saved in a year by the mere mechanics of reading, how much more time can the average young person gain in the six or seven hours of daily leisure!

This new day with the labor-saving devices and efficiency systems will never revert to old standards. We shall continue to live in an era of emphasized ease. If the youth of today will prepare itself for these increased responsibilities by self-culture, well-planned reading, and systematic study, it can convert the overplus of time into tangible benefits for the harmony and happiness of the homes which, please God, they may be privileged to build.

### MIXED MARRIAGES

Thy God shall be my God - Ruth 1:16

International attention was arrested a few years ago by the marriage of a Seattle girl to the Maharajah of Indore and the previous conversion of the American bride to Hinduism. Skeptical newspaper-writers hinted that a $300,000,000 Oriental estate was not an incidental attraction. Whatever the actual motives were, the wedding ceremony cost no less than $250,000. In preparation a fruit diet was prescribed for the bride in order to "purity the vibrations of her impure nature, caused by her having eaten cow's flesh." On the wedding-day she was subjected to a ceremonial bath, when "holy water" of the Ganges was poured upon her head to the chanting of Vedic hymns and prayers. After this the American bride partook of a ceremonial dish, pancha amrita, a concoction of milk, curds, honey, liquefied butter, and sugar, sprinkled with sacred kusaj grass. In the next step of the ritual she prepared small balls of rice cooked in cow's milk as an offering to the sacred fire. After extended ceremonies she received a Hindu name, which she had to write with a diamond ring in rice and grain spread over a golden plate. Finally the officiating priest drew a red kumkuma mark on her forehead as a sign of conversion to Hinduism. The marriage ceremony itself began with the invocation of Ganesa, the elephant-headed god, continued with the chanting of Sanskrit verses, the throwing of saffron-colored rice on the heads of the couple, and concluded with placing ceremonial beads on the wife's neck.

Such interracial alliances stand condemned before the forum of all clear-thinking people. Yet the Racial Relationships Commission maintained by the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America has on occasion gone out of its way to encourage such interracial marriages. This may be seen from statements in Information Service (published by the Department of Research and Education of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America) of November 13, 1926. Referring to the widely heralded Olivet Conference, devoted "largely to the relation of Negroes and whites," the bulletin asserted: "Dr. George Haynes of the Federal Council presented the problem and illuminated with his very extensive knowledge every discussion of the week.... Nor was the question of intermarriage evaded. That was considered at length. It was felt that some pioneer spirits should take advanced steps in that direction... After the discussion on intermarriage the group concluded that, if the individuals concerned fully realize the difficulties involved, mixed marriages may be socially highly desirable."

In the furtherance of its own program, Communism has ardently encouraged interracial marriages; and this enthusiasm has tinged the preaching and practice at some of our radical youth gatherings. For instance, an eye-and-ear witness at the American Youth Congress at Detroit furnishes this picture of the social mixing of the black and white races: "I cannot refrain from saying, simply and positively, that the most shocking thing I saw in connection with the Detroit Youth Congress was the social mixing of boys and girls of the black and white races... While Clarence Hathaway expounded the doctrine of Communism, not three seats removed from me a white girl clung to the arm of, and openly petted with, one of the blackest sons of Africa I have ever seen. This was not an isolated circumstance."

University lecturers, with a flare for this new enlightenment, have based their advocacy of Negro and Caucasian intermarriages on the theory that the strains of negroid blood will strengthen the white race. But these social revolutionists will never be able to remove the insurmountable difficulties that are created by interracial alliances. What of the children? What of the social restrictions? We heartily agree with the deliberate verdict of Dr. Charles Eliot, former president of Harvard: "Intermarriage between members of races that are not kindred is generally condemned by medical, sanitary, and eugenic authorities; so that the right policy in nations which include many different races is not fusion or blending or amalgamation but a separate, parallel development of each race, acting in concord with the other races, but each preserving through many generations its own bodily and mental characteristics."

#### THE UNEQUAL YOKE OF FAITH AND UNBELIEF

With increasing frequency in our present-day helter-skelter young people are thrown together with those who have no church connection and apparently no desire for it. Too often a romance develops, with no serious thought for the question of spiritual like-mindedness. Youth sanguinely insists: "We love each other, and love conquers everything." A marriage is solemnized; and the Christian partner is content with hoping that the unchurched mate may be brought into the Church as the years speed on. Often an unbelieving husband has been brought to Jesus Christ through the intercession and example of a Christian wife. Bismark, the Iron Chancellor, whose liberal attitudes toward politics and religion were traceable to his home environment, was drawn at least temporarily closer to the Church through the influence of his wife, Johanna von Puttkamer, a young woman with "a serious and pious mind." In thousands of similar instances the promise of 1 Pet. 3:1, 2 has been fulfilled: "Ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, that, if any obey not the Word, they also may without the Word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation, coupled with fear."

More often the consequences are distressing for both husband and wife. After an interesting romance, Mark Twain proposed marriage to Olivia L. Langdon, a Christian young woman, reared in a Christian home by the love of Christian parents. The standard biographies relate little of her reaction to Mark Twain's antagonism to Christianity. It seems that her Christian ideals at first had a profound influence upon the great humorist; for in February, 1870, just before their marriage, Mark Twain wrote a deeply spiritual letter to Olivia, closing with these words: "Turn to the Cross, Olivia, turn to the Cross! I turn with you. The peace of God will rest upon us, and all will be well." So she accepted him, perhaps, as many young women in the Church today, secretly cherishing the hope that her husband might be brought close to the faith by her words, her prayers, her example. At first these hopes seemed close to fulfilment. Albert Bigelow Paine in his biography of Mark Twain records: "His natural kindness of heart, and especially his love for his wife, inclined him toward the teachings and customs of her Christian faith. ... It took very little persuasion on his wife's part to establish family prayers in their home, grace before meals, and the morning reading of a Bible chapter." One of Clemens's cronies who visited the household of the newly-weds could hardly stifle his surprise when he heard the humorist, skeptic that he knew him to be, ask a blessing and join in family worship.

That was in the ecstasy of their early married life. Just how seriously Mark Twain accepted these religious exercises will perhaps never be known. But soon he began to express distaste. One day, as Paine recalls, he burst out in protest: "Livy, you may keep this up if you want to, but I must ask you to excuse me from it. It is making me a hypocrite. I don't believe in the Bible; it contradicts my reason. I can't sit here and listen to it, letting you believe that I regard it, as you do, in the light of the Gospel, the Word of God."

The dreams of a happy unity in Christ which Olivia Langdon may have cherished were shattered. But the tragedy sped to a more grievous catastrophe. Mark Twain's unbelief ultimately exerted a deadening influence upon her own faith. As the years rolled by and she was daily exposed to her husband's skepticism (which apparently grew with his success), she began to feel the foundation of her faith waver. Close contact with the coterie of like-minded scoffers in this country and abroad soon began to break her spiritual resistance. Paine summarizes the results of his relentless attack on her faith: "She had lost something, too; she had outstripped her traditions. One day when she and her sister had walked across the fields and had stopped to rest in a little grove by a pretty pond, she confessed, timidly enough and not without sorrow, how she had drifted away from her orthodox views. She had ceased to believe, she said, in the orthodox Bible God who exercised a personal supervision over every human soul. The hordes of people she had seen in many lands, the philosophies she had listened to from her husband and those wise ones about him, the life away from the restricted round of home, all had contributed to this change."

Years later, in the crushing sorrow of heavy bereavement, Mark Twain sought to strengthen his wife with the words: "Livy, if it comforts you to lean on the Christian faith, do so." But her answer was the response of lost hope. She replied: "I can't, Youth" (her favorite designation for her husband); "I haven't any."

We cannot estimate the sacrifice of happiness in that house which is divided against itself through irreligion. There can be no permanent harmony and complete understanding where an unchurched partner by active or passive opposition continually resists Christian faith and where the specter of separation in eternity looms up in all its ghastliness. In the day of trouble there is need for the complete dedication to the one Lord who "doeth all things well" and for the mutual strengthening of spiritual encouragement. To be joined in marriage with an unbeliever is an acid test of one's Christianity; and that this test is usually too strong is shown by the fact that the believing husband or wife is frequently estranged from the Church, imperceptibly at first, but openly at last. Thrift, good taste, pleasing personality, physical attractiveness, sense of humor, sympathy, neatness, patience, success, and the long catalog of other demands upon which young people frequently insist are all secondary when compared with the fundamental fact that without Christ, acknowledged by both husband and wife, there can be little definite assurance of lasting happiness. When marriage has only a physical foundation; when it is based merely on mental similarity and attraction; when it entirely ignores spiritual compatibility, it overlooks the one divine element which makes for family unification. How much more hopeful the marriage dominated by a common faith, communion of worship, and spiritual cooperation, through which joy and sorrow alike can be shared together! What an inestimably more reassuring promise of mutual understanding in the pledge (Ruth 1:16) "Thy people shall be my people and thy God my God"!

The question which continually suggests itself in the discussion of mixed marriages crystallizes into a hypothetical case contained in a letter from a perplexed young woman: "Suppose there were a Christian girl who had met a man whom she believed to be the 'only man in the world' for her, even though he was without church affiliation. The obvious solution of course would be to persuade the husband to become a member of her Church. But suppose he refused to be interested in religion. Would you then say that it were better for this young woman not to marry at all than to marry some one with no more spiritual qualification than that?"

This issue confronts a larger number of our young people than we may believe, and in answering, I do not hesitate to state that a Christian girl should not marry a man who has no interest in religion or who is connected with organizations opposed to the Church. There are always exceptional cases in which an unbelieving or disinterested husband has been brought to Christ through the intercession of a Christian wife. Such isolated instances do not disprove the general truth that for the sacred union of marriage a Christian should be wedded to a sincere follower of Jesus. Young men or women in danger of giving their hearts to those in whose life Christ plays no part should stop, look, and listen to the Word of God, to the shipwrecks on the matrimonial sea, to the claims of unborn children, before they enter into a marriage in which there is no common ground for prayer and no common hope for a reunion in the life beyond the grave. Such a marriage of course is legally and civilly unobjectionable; but it certainly does not conform to Biblical ideals. It would be better by far for young people confronted by this dilemma to ask God for strength to tear this love from their hearts.

Even worldly wisdom protests against marriages between church-members and unbelievers. A young man who assumes the pen-name "Hannibal" writes to the question box of the Chicago Tribune and receives this pointed answer from the professional counselor of that paper:

"Hannibal tells me he has no 'religious hallucinations,' does not go to church, has no creed, does not believe in God, heaven, hell, or the Bible. He is not, however prejudiced against any religion or belief, and he does not try to convert any one to his way of thinking.

"'So much for that,' says he. 'Don't write me a thesis on religion, for I know more about it than you do; but please write an answer to my problem, regarding which you know more than I do.'

"Hannibal's problem is this: He is engaged to a beautiful girl whose folks have just learned he considers religion as bunk, and now, he says, they would just about as soon see their daughter married to a 'cross-eyed, hump-backed, tongue-tied half-breed Turkish Eskimo' as to Hannibal.

"'Because they have some kind of faith, regarding which they cannot even talk intelligently and, like all churchgoers, know nothing about it at all, says Hannibal, 'they have the nerve to tell me I can't marry their girl because I have no church and could talk them black and blue in the face with pertinent things to show I know what I am talking about.

"'Now, what I want to know is this: Should a blind faith in their religion make me so far below them that I am unworthy of their daughter? I will let my wife go to any church or all of the churches she wants to; and if she needs religion, I'll see that she gets it. Do you really and truly believe her parents have justification in their attitude?'

"Yes, Hannibal, I think they have justification in their attitude. Quite so. If she were my daughter, I'd as soon see her married to the cross-eyed, tongue-tied half-breed, for the simple reason that a girl with religion married to a man without would find the same compatibility she would with one who couldn't talk to her in her own language or understand her motives. For all your so-considered liberality of thought about letting the other fellow have his religion, you haven't got it. You couldn't have it and feel the way you do about it. You call it bunk; so you couldn't be tolerant about it. Human nature is not built upon lines like that. You could not feel as violently as you do upon the subject of religion without making the girl unhappy should she marry you. You are as intolerant of her parents' belief as they are of your lack of it.

"Without wishing to start any religious argument, I cannot see how your marriage into that family would bring anything but unhappiness to the girl. Persons with religion and persons without can no more mix than water and oil.

"A man without religion is his own master. The personal self obtrudes too much on consciousness to make another happy for any length of time, let alone make oneself happy. How can it be otherwise with no one but yourself to answer to?"

#### CHRISTIAN AND JEWISH INTERMARRIAGE

Of more importance, because of its increasing frequency, is the marriage of Christians and Jews. The Mosaic law legislates against intermarriage, mentioning specifically seven prohibited Canaanite groups and declaring: "Thou shalt not make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, and his daughter shalt thou not take unto thy son" (Deut. 7:3). Throughout the Old Testament there has been an emphasized antipathy to this commingling of Jewish and Gentile blood. Solomon is severely criticized for his notorious marriages with heathen princesses. When Nehemiah returned from Susa and surveyed the lamentable remains of ruined Jerusalem, one of his first efforts was to preserve the survivors from contamination through intermarriage with the Gentiles. When Ezra came to the royal city, he found a composite citizenry that spoke a patois, promiscuously entering into mixed marriage after the example of the priests and princes. The unspeakable horror which this provoked is expressed in his words: "When I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and sat down astonished" (Ezra 9:3). With untempered rigor did these two leaders demand that the men separate from their heathen wives. In accord with this vigorous protest, injunctions against matrimonial alliances with Gentiles were codified in the Talmud as established Jewish law. (Cf. M. Mielziner, The Jewish Law of Marriage and Divorce, p. 45.)

Today, too, orthodox Jews feel an almost instinctive revulsion against every form of intermarriage. In homes where the rigor of old traditions still survives a Jewish son who marries a Christian woman commits the all but unpardonable offense. His family sits in mourning and regards him as dead. He is ostracized by his relatives and friends. Sir Adolph Tuck, chairman of Raphael Tuck, Ltd., the well-known British greeting-card firm, left a $1,600,000 estate acquired largely through the sale of Christmas-cards. In orthodox protest the testator stipulated that any of his children who married a Christian should be disinherited.

In his illuminating tract Judaism and Marriage, Felix A. Levy, Ph. D., Rabbi at Emanuel Congregation in Chicago, states the conservative attitude toward intermarriage (p. 11): "Mixed marriages, or unions between Jews and non-Jews, are discouraged by Judaism, the chief reasons being that differing religious views in the household are not conducive to peace and harmony, love and understanding, that an intimate relation such as marriage must foster. It has been the experience of the Jewish people that, when partners, are of different faiths, the home will not be conducted Jewishly, and, in addition to other disadvantages, the children will not be reared as Jews. Judaism is the religion of a small minority, which can ill afford to weaken itself by loss of any of its members. Religions, like nations, have a natural anxiety to guard their hearths against loss by defection or desertion. If, however, the stranger embraces Judaism whole-heartedly and willingly joins the Jewish people, he or she is made welcome, and an intermarriage may take place."

With the insistent growth of liberal Judaism the stigma on intermarriage lost much of its rankling bitterness. Even in earlier and stricter days, despite the decree of Constantius (339 A. D.) forbidding the marriage of a Christian to a Jewess under penalty of death (a measure which was repeated by the third and fourth Lateran Councils as well as by subsequent church-bodies), marriages between Christians and Jews were not unusual, as Graetz demonstrates. (History of the Jews, Vol. 3, p. 54) During the Moslem dominion of Spain mixed marriages were frequent. In 1807 Napoleon summoned a Jewish convocation to the city of Paris, and among other issues which he submitted for solution was the question whether Jews were to be permitted to intermarry with Christians. The finding of this body was: "The great Sanhedrin declares that marriage between Israelites and Christians contracted according to the laws of the 'Code Civil' are from a civil standpoint binding and valid; and although such marriages cannot be invested with the religious forms, they shall not entail any disciplinary punishment (anathema)." More recently there are notable instances of such Jewish-Christian alliances. August Belmont, American financier, married a daughter of Commander Perry. Ossip Gabrilowitch, concert pianist, married Mark Twain's daughter. Walter Dam-rosch, known to every American music-lover, married the daughter of James G. Blaine. Sir Arthur Sullivan, composer, was the son of a Christian-Jewish marriage; also Bret Harte, famous author; Sir John Herschel, astronomer; Francis Turner Palgrave, critic; Sir John Millais, artist; Leon Gambetta, statesman; General William Booth.

These marriages are not restricted to distinguished or liberal minds. Thirty years ago Rabbi Harris Weinstock (Jesus the Jew, p. 137) wrote: "There are many who can recall the time, some decades ago, when an intermarriage between Jew and Christian was of the rarest occurrence. ... But a few years ago, in discussing the question with one of our former Rabbis, the point arose as to what percentage of intermarriages existed in our midst. estimated such marriages to be about 2 or 3 per cent of our Jewish community. On making out a careful list, imagine our surprise to find that they represented fully 10 per cent of our Jewish popula-tion." Since his time there has been no diminution in these Jew-Gentile unions, particularly in such cities as New York, where one eighth of all the Jews in the world find their domicile and where the telephone directory shows sixteen columns of Cohens and only fourteen of Smiths. Altogether, the attitude of the Jewish Church officials has not been kindly disposed toward mixed marriage, because they have realized, as Theilhaber (Der Untergang der deut-schen Juden, Berlin, 1921, p. 37) concedes: "Mixed marriages lead the exodus from Judaism."

Ordinarily mixed marriages with Jews, even if freedom of worship is conceded to the Christian partner, have no promise of lasting blessing. The intervening gulf of conflicting traditions, contradictory creeds, antagonistic philosophies of life, can be bridged only in isolated exceptions. Even then a party to this mixed relation moved by the sincerity of a deep Christian conviction can never know the peace and contentment arising from a common faith and the hope of reunion in heaven. Many Jews who enter these interracial marriages are religiously indifferent, and the all too frequent consequence is the submergence of spiritual conviction. Since "no man liveth to himself," least of all in marriage, the constant influence of harpooning relatives stimulates domestic discord.

This religious incompatibility is far more serious than the eugenic interest which Germany has displayed in its official frown upon Jew-and-Gentile intermarriage. The Nazis, who have fanatically set their face against any commingling of Semitic and Nordic blood, are not concerned about the cleft which antagonized religious interests must create but are impelled by a theory for pure-blooded race preservation. They make the mistake which has consistently characterized the modern pursuit of the social sciences — they minimize or neglect altogether the religious element. It can be positively shown that Jews who have been converted to Christianity may make very acceptable life partners for Christians. That was the experience of Jenny Lind. Her husband, Otto Goldschmidt, was born a Jew, but was baptized before marriage. Their home was happy.

I shall never be able to forget the penetrating happiness on the face of a woman who rushed up after the conclusion of a church service in Chicago to say that the most joy-filled day of her life had come; for, as she explained, she had been married to a Jewish gentleman for twelve years, and he had just told her that he had resolved to accept Christ and join the Church. After twelve years of married life she felt instinctively that the final and complete happiness had just come. And the letter written by the converted husband shortly after his baptism breathed the joy and understanding of a new grasp on life.

#### INTERDENOMINATIONAL MARRIAGES

The question is frequently asked, "How about marriage outside one's own Church, a union in which, for example, the husband belongs to one Church and the wife to another?" This situation is quite different from that in which one of the contracting parties is an unbeliever, or non-Christian; yet even these interdenominational marriages are far from ideal. A marriage outside one's own Church frequently entails insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes arrangements are made so that the husband attends his church and the wife hers, — a pathetic departure from the ideals of family unity and common worship! Or on one Sunday both attend the wife's church, and on the following Sunday both attend the husband's.

Serious objections are involved in either case, for this arrangement seldom functions satisfactorily and generally produces marked indifference on the part of both husband and wife. After the children come, more acute problems develop. We know marriages of this kind in which harmony and contentment seem to prevail, but they are not frequent. Below the serenity of the surface there is often a resignation which bravely resolves to make the best of a disheartening situation.

Often conditions become so intolerable that a broken home is the consequence of a mixed marriage. In Youth Tell Their Story (p. 21) investigators on the American Counsel on Education report after personal interviews with more than 13,500 young people in Maryland that "the extent of divorce, separation, and desertion among parents of mixed affiliations is over twice as great as among parents whose [church] affiliations are not mixed."

From my extensive correspondence files covering mixed marriages the following is offered as typical of the many misunderstandings which may develop even in marriages between Protestants of different churches:

"When I married, I knew my husband did not belong to the Lutheran Church but to another Protestant group. I was led to believe that he could not change because of his mother's heart. So I married him, thinking that certainly one sermon in our church would convince him which was the true Church. I also thought that, if I gave a good example, he would see what the true doctrine works. Anyway, when the children came, he promised that I was to bring them up in our Church. Now, after much controversy and many unpleasant scenes, he insists that they shall be in programs in his church. Always the mother's heart was given as an excuse. I can't quarrel any more. Please don't think he's bad. He provides well for us and is kind otherwise, but when church matters come up, he is terrible. No one can talk to him. And I can't stand any more trouble. My prayer for twelve years has been to make him understand. Please tell me where I am wrong."

For ten years, from 1926 to 1936, H. A. Dittmar, teacher at Mount Calvary Lutheran School, St. Louis, Mo., carefully observed the church attendance of children who came from homes in which both parents are affiliated with the same church and homes in which one parent or no parent is a church-member. He finds in the case of 508 children and in a total of more than 500 church services that the average attendance for children with two Lutheran parents is 77.12 per cent. In families with only one parent a Lutheran the average is 62.31 per cent, and in homes where neither parent is a member of the Church the average drops to 56.8 per cent.

In the 1939 survey of 3,101 families, which, it is contended, shows the trend of modern marriages, the Board of American Missions in the United Lutheran Church found that in most cases of mixed marriages less than one third of the once Lutheran parties retained their connection with the Lutheran Church or joined another communion. The summary of these mixed marriages follows:

|                         | In Active<br>Membership with Lutheran<br>Church | Not Now Affiliated with Any Church | Total<br>Marriages |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |

The fact that most divorces involving members of the Lutheran Church occurred in mixed marriages should be an unmistakable warning. In correspondence with several hundred pastors of our typical congregations throughout the country, expressions like the following have been received:

"There have been but three divorces in the seven years of my pastorate in Saginaw, Michigan, and all three were cases in which the wife was a member but the husband a non-member."

"In the twenty-five years of my pastorate I have had two divorces. Both were mixed marriages."

"I have had only two divorces in twenty-seven years among the families of my church in Long Beach, California. In both cases the husband was not a member of the Church."

"During my eight years in Salt Lake City I have had but one case of divorce among my membership. The wife, who was granted the divorce, was my member, while the husband was not."

"Since my advent to Mobile ten years ago there have been six divorces. In all these cases, with one exception, either husband or wife was of another denomination."

"During the seven years of my pastorate in Kingston there has been but one divorce, and the husband was not a member of the Church."

"During my four years of service in New Orleans there have been but three divorces in our congregation. In two instances only one of the parties involved was a member of the Church."

"On an average in the past seven years we have had one divorce a year in this Fort Wayne congregation, and in all but two cases either the husband or the wife was not a member of our Church."

"During my pastorate of forty-one years in Chicago I performed 348 marriages. Of these, eleven couples have been divorced, but in only one of these eleven cases were both husband and wife members of our Church."

These interdenominational marriages are of course the most common of all mixed marriages. Because of their very frequency the counsel which the Church extends must be practical and definite. This advice cannot be clothed in the formal recommendations made by the Committee on Marriage and the Home for the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America. The opening resolution, approved by the Administrative Committee of the Council in March, 1932, declares: "Where the persons contemplating marriage are members of different communions nearly related in doctrine or polity, they may well be advised by their respective pastors to settle the question before marriage by agreeing to attend together one or the other of their churches, or even a third church, and to bring up their children in it." Since the attitude of the Federal Council of Churches in America is notoriously unionistic and classifies as "communions nearly related in doctrine or polity" (our italics) practically all the major Protestant denominations, this pronouncement says in effect that, if a Baptist young woman meets a Methodist young man and they decide to marry, the man should give up Methodism and become a Baptist, or the woman should renounce the Baptist Church and become a Methodist, or both should forsake their churches and become Presbyterians. It is a mystery that these concessions to spiritual indifference can be proclaimed in the name of Jesus Christ.

Our deliberate counsel to all the young people of our Church confronted by the prospect of interdenominational marriage is this: Remember that you have pledged yourself to your Church by a sacred oath and that you can tolerate no compromise with error in any form. You cannot permit even marriage to make you untrue to your Church and its divine truth. Consider very carefully all the factors involved in marriage with some one outside your Church. If in the face of the warnings of experience you still feel, after deliberate and prayerful thought, that you must marry a member of another Church, then maintain your religious life and devotion to your own Church even more faithfully than before and hope and pray and work for the conversion of your life's helpmate to your faith and the unity of hope and love which it inspires.

#### MIXED MARRIAGE OF CATHOLICS AND PROTESTANTS

When a Protestant young man or woman contemplates marriage with a Roman Catholic, the complications become critical. The perplexities of this problem are well stated in a letter from a correspondent in Chicago: "I am a young woman twenty-six years old, a member of a Lutheran church. For nine years I have been working in the same office, where I met a young man of Catholic faith. We were friends for a long time and met socially, enjoying each other's company very much. Now for several years we have seen each other outside the office at least once a week. We get along splendidly, love each other very much, but as far as religion is concerned, we merely show respect for the other's, but do not, I hardly need tell you, agree on that score...

"We, of course, would like to get married, and I have to make the decision as far as my own action is concerned, which I find very difficult to do. The Catholic Church would excommunicate this young man and would not consider the marriage valid if he were married by any one else than a priest. If I consent to be married by a priest, I would not be excommunicated by the Lutheran Church and my marriage would be considered legal. I would, how-ever, have to consent to have my children baptized and brought up in the Catholic faith. How can I consent to this?

"The future therefore is really our problem; because, if we were married, thinking only of the present, each one of us could worship according to his own faith. But when I think of bringing up my children in a different faith, I feel that I could not go woough with that. Then, too, I appreciate that this young man feel that beneath all the outward manifestations we believe in the same God — so there we are again."

This young woman sees the situation more clearly than many others, and if she had directed her questions to a priest, the procedure might have followed the course outlined in an Atlantic Monthly (September, 1935) article, entitled "A Roman Court-ship." This was a part of biographical reminiscences by Lord Howard of Penrith, better known in this country as Sir Esme Howard, British ambassador to the United States from 1924 to 1930. With considerable detail, and not without some doctrinal inaccuracies, Sir Esme recounts his courtship in Rome preceding his marriage to Isabella, granddaughter of Princess Bandini, a marriage which was directly responsible for his conversion to the Catholic Church.

In his preliminary remarks the former ambassador recalls the intimate scene of his proposal and relates that Isabella agreed to marry him provided he turn Catholic. Although he regards his conversion to that Church as a forlorn hope, he is finally won over to try the experiment. When he asks for some one to explain the doctrines of the Roman Church, his wife-to-be suggests one of the high papal authorities, Monsignor Merry del Val.

An interesting account of four weeks' ensuing religious discussions now follows in these magazine memoirs. We are taken to the top floor of the Vatican Palace, and as the conversations between the titled Englishman and the papal prince are summarized, we see that the various doctrines of Protestantism are labeled as "guesswork," that their creeds are indicted as local, not universal, that Roman bias labels the disloyal disciples who left the Savior at Capernaum as the first Protestants.

As the lessons proceed, the objections that Sir Esme raised against Catholicism are removed by scholastic logic and papal pronouncements. The Roman Church is exalted as having the only true faith. Purgatory is explained and justified, not from Scripture but from false, syllogistic reasoning; for the instructor teaches that as Christ's sufferings redound to the benefit of mankind, so human suffering, in imitation of Christ's, can be used to decrease the anguish of relatives and acquaintances in purgatory. The bland claims are raised without challenge that priests can impose whatever penance they please; that Peter as the first Pope is the rock upon which papal infallibility is based; that the Catholic doctrine of the Lord's Supper and the sacrifices of the Mass are divine and Scriptural. The month of instruction did not fail in its purpose. There came a day when, as Sir Esme sat under Tasso's oak, on an eminence overlooking the Holy City, he was mysteriously moved. Before long he attended Mass and was ready for conversion — and marriage.

Unfortunately this combination of Catholic propaganda and a springtime romance in Rome may prove interesting reading to those who are ignorant of the facts involved in conversions to Catholicism for the sake of marriage. Young people who read these reminiscences of the British diplomat may be tempted to regard the emphatic protest of the Church against marriage with Catholics as biased and antiquated; and while they may not be ready to give up the faith to which they are pledged with a sacred promise and embrace Catholicism, as Sir Esme Howard did, they may conclude that the Church has been all too serious in its denunciation of mixed marriages.

These young people will be surprised to note that the Catholic Church has definitely set its face against mixed marriages and declares: "Everywhere the Church most strictly forbids marriages between two baptized persons one of whom is Catholic and the other a member of a heretical or schismatic sect," i..., a non-Catholic. (New Code of Canon Law, Canon 1060.) The complexities of modern life and the resultant intermarriages have led the Roman Church to offer dispensations permitting marriage with non-Catholics, but only on the basis of "just and grave" reasons: the expectation that the mixed marriage will be of great benefit to the Catholic Church, e. g., the union of a Protestant prince with a Catholic princess; the reasonable hope for the conversion of the non-Catholic; the avoidance of scandal; and the obviating of marriage before a Protestant minister or a justice of the peace. The Rev. Fulgence Meyer, O. F. M., adds this statement to show the real attitude of his Church: "Even when she [the Roman Catholic Church] grants the dispensation, her conduct with reference to the mixed marriage is one of reluctance and coercion." (Youth's Pathfinder, p. 242.) Where no approved motivation exists, the dispensation is not granted; and if a mixed marriage is consummated without dispensation, it is unlawful. (L.c., p. 49.)

In an increasingly rigorous policy of restriction, Roman Catholicism has laid down a number of conditions which are to be followed conscientiously by its priests and systematically given its laity after the dispensation for the mixed marriage is granted. The non-Catholic person in the marriage is obliged to sign the following promises in the presence of two witnesses: "I, the under-signed, not a member of the Catholic Church, wishing to contract marriage with N.N., a member of the Catholic Church, intend to do so with the understanding that the marriage tie cannot be dissolved except by death and promise him (her) on my word of honor that he (she) shall enjoy the free exercise of his (her) Catholic religion and that all the children of either sex born of this marriage shall be baptized and educated in the faith and according to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church. I further promise that no marriage ceremony other than that to be performed by the Catholic priest shall take place."

The Catholic party signs the following promise: "I, the under-signed, a member of the Catholic Church, wishing to contract marriage with N. N., do hereby promise that I will have all my children baptized and educated in the Catholic religion and that I will practice my religion faithfully and do all I can, especially by prayer, example, and the frequentation of the Sacraments, to bring about the conversion of my consort." (Our Sunday Visitor, April 29, 1934.) For years the Catholic Church has insisted upon this written agreement. But now Catholic authorities in some of the dioceses demand that the prenuptial promises be attested and notarized as civil contracts. A priest at the Gesu Church in Milwaukee explained the reason: "This contract is so formulated and so guarded that it can be enforced in the courts if necessary. In the past no such legal recognition was attached to the prenuptial agreement between parties to a mixed marriage."

The formal demand is made, first of all, that mixed marriages be solemnized by a Catholic priest. Where this first requisite is neglected or repudiated, the marriage is not regarded as a valid union by the provision of the Ne Temere dectee (1908), and the Catholic member may be excommunicated. It is specifically excluded that either before or after the Catholic marriage ceremony there be any other religious rites performed by a Protestant minister. The language of the new Catholic code is definite and decisive: "Even though a dispensation has been obtained from the impediment of mixed religion, the consorts cannot, either before or after the marriage entered into before the Church, approach either personally or by proxy a non-Catholic minister acting in his religious capacity to give or to renew their matrimonial consent." (Canon 1063.) In effect the Roman Catholic attitude toward mixed marriages insists that all marriages solemnized by a non-Catholic officiant are, in the eyes of that Church, invalid and essentially equivalent to concubinage or common-law marriage.

Meyer states explicitly: "It may be worth mentioning in this connection that, if a Catholic is married before a civil magistrate or a Protestant minister, the marriage is null and void. As little as they can confer the sacraments of penance or extreme unction, for instance, so little can those personages by their presence ratify the reception of the sacrament of matrimony on the part of a Catholic. In fact, the Catholic who attempts marriage before a Protestant minister not only is not married, but also sins grievously against the holy faith in consequence of his or her recognition of non-Catholic worship. And the Catholic who is best man or, respectively, bridesmaid at a wedding the ceremony of which is performed by a Protestant minister commits a mortal sin against the faith for the same reason." (O.c., p. 322.)

The Rev. John A. O'Brien, Ph. D., chaplain of the Catholic students, University of Illinois, issues this pointed pronouncement in Our Sunday Visitor, April 29, 1934: "The Church finds herself obliged to require that the marriage be performed by a Catholic priest. To sanction the marriage of one of her children with a non-Catholic before a Protestant minister would mean that the Church was implicitly recognizing such a denomination, founded by a mere man, to be of equal validity with the Church established by Jesus Christ. This the Church could do only at the cost of her intellectual integrity. Then, the Catholic regards marriage as a sacrament, while most Protestant ministers do not. With no wish to hurt the feelings of our dear Protestant friends, the Church finds herself compelled, by the clear consciousness of her divine origin and of the mission divinely appointed under her, to give to error no more recognition than her divine Founder gave to it.

"To place the churches of Martin Luther, John Calvin. John Knox, John Wesley, Mrs Mary Baker Eddy, and by Mrs. Aimee Semple McPherson Hutton on the same plane as the Church founded by Christ and to clothe them with the same authority would be for her to commit the sin of apostasy. That is why the Church forbids her children to attempt to contract matrimony before the minister of a heretical sect. Those unworthy members who deliberately and wilfully violate that solemn law the Church punishes with excommunication. For they are guilty not only of grievous disobedience to the Church, but also of treason to the faith of Jesus Christ."

Both husband and wife must also pledge that all children issuing from the mixed marriage are to be baptized and educated in the Catholic faith only. Explaining the detailed requirements of this stipulation, Rev. William I. Lonergan, S. J., says in America (April 23, 1932): "As for the promises to educate the children Catholics, this implies not only that they will be baptized, be taught their prayers, be brought up to attend Mass, be prepared for confession, Communion, and confirmation, and, in general, learn the rudiments of religion, but that they will be so grounded in their faith and its practices that it may be anticipated that they will continue steadfast." In a new ruling issued by the Congregation of the Sacred Office in Vatican City on February 5, 1932, the Catholic Church tells the world it will regard as invalid the marriage of Catholics and non-Catholics unless this pledge of the Catholic education of the children is maintained. Under the interpretation of this provision the Roman Church will no longer accept the plea that the laws of any nation prevent the proper Catholic training. In case the Catholic husband or wife dies first, the Protestant spouse must promise to fulfil his or her pledge. If these promises are regarded as mere formalities and made with no sincere intention, the marriage is rejected as invalid.

This, incidentally, is a sensational reverse of the traditional Roman position. Heretofore marriage has derived its permanence in Catholic theology from its alleged sacramental character; but henceforth the Roman Church teaches that a marriage solemnized in the accepted Roman manner may be declared void after ten or fifteen years either because of insincerity or because of the failure to educate children acceptably after marriage. This position may lead to terrifying consequences. When a relationship between man and woman recognized and blessed as marriage may later be dissolved and stigmatized as invalid and the children branded as illegitimate, this procedure must be denounced as treacherous and destructive.

Because Roman Catholics sometimes deny the force and facts of these assertions, it may be well to quote this authoritative statement from the widely read Catholic organ Our Sunday Visitor, April 10, 1932:

"Question: If a Catholic wishes to marry a non-Catholic, what promises must the non-Catholic make? If the promise is broken, is the marriage a valid union?

"Answer: The non-Catholic must promise, in the presence of witnesses and the priest, that he will consider the marriage bond as indissoluble except by death, that he will not in any way interfere with the Catholic party in the free exercise of his or her religion, that all the children who are born to the union will be reared in the Catholic faith, and that there will be no ceremony save that before the priest.

"A valid marriage is always valid, and a broken promise cannot make it invalid. However, if the non-Catholic person were not sincere and never intended to keep his promises, he obtained the dispensation for the mixed marriage under false pretenses. In such a case the dispensation is not valid and the marriage therefore not a valid one." (Our italics.)

Furthermore, the duty is incumbent upon the Catholic party to work wisely and discreetly, yet with all possible means, to bring about the conversion of the Protestant party to the Catholic faith. In explaining the requirement of this pledge, Catholics are directed to offer their non-Catholic spouses literature on the Catholic re-ligion, to invite them to attend Mass, and to encourage cordial relations between the non-Catholic and the priest. (Lynch, L. c., p. 50.) If the non-Catholic does not maintain the prenuptial pledge, the marriage may be declared invalid. If Catholic husbands or wives violate the Church's injunction, they are to be excommunicated immediately and denied all church rites and privileges. According to the stricter Roman requirements the dead body of a non-Catholic husband or wife may not be interred beside that of the Roman spouse in a consecrated Catholic cemetery, even though the marriage was performed in literal accordance with church rites. As a further hindrance Canon 1102 specifies that, when a priest solemnizes a mixed marriage, "all sacred rites are forbidden." Some of the ceremonies may be admitted in exceptional instances, but the reading of the Mass is definitely ruled out. Fulgence Meyer (I.c., p. 244) says: "She [the Roman Catholic Church] does not publish the banns or announce the [mixed] marriage in church. She seems to be ashamed of it. Officially and publicly she takes no notice of the marriage whatever, save that she tolerates the pastor or his delegate to be the merest witness to the cold ceremony and has him to make the proper entries in the official books of the church. She does not allow the marriage to be celebrated in the church. The ceremony usually takes place in the rectory. She permits no blessing of the ring or the couple and withholds from the bride that beautiful blessing which she speaks over the bride during the nuptial Mass. She says no prayers whatever for the conjugal happiness of the couple. She does not have the priest to wear sacred vestments, not even the surplice and stole. She uses no holy water and no candles. She does nothing that bespeaks joy, comfort, or hope; but her whole attitude betrays fear, suspicion, and distrust."

Even with these regulations, mixed marriages are not welcome in the Catholic Church. Dr. William Stang, an eminent Roman authority, in Spiritual Pepper and Salt (pp. 155—158), embodies the prevalent denunciation of marriage with Protestants: "But despite these conditions, signed and solemnly sworn to, whole generations are lost. Many an upright Protestant refuses to sign the above conditions, and I respect him for his refusal. Many more who sign them have no intention of obligating themselves by them. What troubles and afflictions follow such marriages God alone could tell. As fellow-citizens we must do all in our power to persuade non-Catholics not to rush into misery by marrying a Catholic. 'But I have promised to marry him? Break your promise [!], for you should not keep a promise to do wrong! Are there not many conversions resulting from mixed marriages? Yes, a few; but, oh, the loss on the other side! In the majority of mixed marriages the children are lost to the faith. If you are a Catholic, the fact that your Church condemns such marriages should be sufficient reason for you to avoid such an unhallowed union."

Emphatically does Our Sunday Visitor print this statement of the Catholic Information Society under large headlines: "A Warning for All Non-Catholics: Don't Marry a Catholic!" Below this pointed appeal the Catholic writer tells non-Catholics: "Don't ever permit yourselves, dear non-Catholic friends, to fall in love with a Catholic; for love is unreasoning and lures its victims into thinking that they are exceptions to all rules and experiences... The Catholic Church does all in its power to discourage mixed marriages and permits them only with the greatest of reluctance." All in all, the losses sustained by the Catholic Church in consequence of mixed marriages are startling. In a Lenten letter to his priests Cardinal Faulhaber of Munich, Nazi opponent, wrote: "In the year 1922 1,722 licenses were issued by the civil authorities in Munich for mixed marriages, only one third of which were performed by the Carholic priest. In fact, year after year in Germany marriages than there are children won through the mission-work of all Roman Catholic missionaries in the heathen lands."

In Kirchliches Jahrbuch, 1932, a remarkably accurate annual covering church conditions in Germany, we are told that for the year 1930 the vast majority of mixed marriages in Germany were the unions between evangelical Christians and Catholics and that, contrary to popular expectation, more than half of the children born of these unions were baptized Protestant. The complete table follows:

Of 67,258 children born of Protestant-and-Catholic mixed marriages 37,124, or 55.2 per cent, were baptized in Protestant churches.

Of 15,438 children born of Protestant-and-non-religious mixed marriages 11,215, or 72.6 per cent, were baptized in Protestant churches.

In this connection, attention may be called to the relative number of conversions to Protestantism and Catholicism, which are often closely connected with mixed marriages, frequently occasioned by them. In 1930 in all of Germany 16,302 Catholics became Protestants. During the same period 1,971 Protestants became Catholics; in other words, there are more than eight times as many conversions to Protestantism as to Catholicism.

Commenting on the losses sustained by the Roman Church, estimated annually at half a million, Dr. John A. O'Brien (Ecclesiastical Review, December, 1931) takes into serious account the leakage due to mixed marriages. The same feeling of uneasiness and disappointment over Catholic losses through mixed marriages in America is expressed by Fulgence Meyer (l. c., pp. 243, 245, 247): "So many of her [the Roman Catholic Church's] children have been lost to her and to God in this manner that she never tolerates a mixed marriage without fearing lest the Catholic subject may soon, in consequence of the marriage, become a prodigal spiritually and religiously. Her sad experience in the matter has made her justly suspicious and fearful.

"Just yesterday (June 10, 1927) I heard of a Protestant parish in one of our cities which is made up almost completely of defections from the Catholic faith, brought on directly or indirectly through mixed marriages. Can you blame the Church for stopping so heavy and disastrous a leak in the ark of salvation and thereby forestalling the spiritual death of many immortal souls?

"Experience bears me out in saying that nine out of ten mixed marriages are directly or indirectly disastrous for the Catholic party and the offspring of the marriage, and the disaster usually takes the shape of a serious weakening or the complete loss of the holy faith."

In order to provide spiritual guidance for Catholic women who are married to non-Catholic men, the Roman Church has created Monica, the mother of Augustine, a saint. Yet a Catholic writer explicitly warns: "If anything, St. Monica's experience tells every Catholic girl dallying with the danger of a mixed marriage: 'Beware!'" (Youth's Pathfinder, p. 303.)

While the Roman Catholic denunciation of mixed marriages may be intensified by the fact that this Church loses much more than it ever gains through intercreedal unions, no Protestant Church has found intermarriage a desirable factor in the building of the Kingdom. There are exceptional instances in which God moves in His mysterious ways to perpetuate harmony in these conflicting alliances. But no privileged group can confidently insist upon the blessings of this special dispensation when the aggregate of all experience shrieks its protest. With full knowledge of all that this warning implies it is written here and now that young people who choose a Catholic companion for life are toying with invisible dynamite, which may blast their happiness for all time, even for eternity.

Headstrong youth, misled by the glamor of a hasty romance, will be reluctant to accept this well-meant advice. The Church has no escape from the incessant obligation of warning its young people against the disillusioning alliances of Protestant and Catholic marriages. A Catholic young lady may be attractive, lovable, clean, and wholesome; but if she is true to her Church and sincere in the practice of her creed, an insurmountable barrier must interpose itself between her and her husband. When she is told, not once, but a thousand times, that it is her sacred duty to work with all possible means for the conversion of her husband, her zeal in following the mandates of her Church will normally tend to create and widen a cleavage and to repel any self-respecting husband in whom even a spark of loyalty to his Church still glows.

Daniel Defoe should be known as the author not only of Robinson Crusoe but also of the novel called Religious Courtship, or Marriage on Christian Principles. The heroine is a Protestant young woman, who speaks to our generation in the words Defoe attributes to her after her Catholic husband's death:

"It is impossible; no kindness, no tenderness, no affection, can make it up; the condition can never be happy, God faithfully served, children rightly educated, the mind perfectly easy, or the duty of the relation faithfully performed where the opinions in religions differ... We could not worship God together, either abroad or at home... We could never converse with one another upon religious subjects; for we could not enter upon the least serious thing but it led us into contradiction and wild distracted notions, which were immediately forced to take the help of our affections... that we might not break out into indecencies to one another.

"We have, by the help of abundance of good humor on his side and a great deal of love on both sides, avoided differences' and disputes upon that subject [religion]; but, alas! that is but a negative, and it can only be said we did not quarrel, which is a great deal to say, too; but what is this to a happy life? How was our family guided, our children educated, and how would they have been educated if he had lived? And how was God worshiped? He and his priest at their Mass in the oratory or chapel; I and my little unhappy babies in my chamber and closet, where I mourned over them continually (rather than prayed over them to think that some time or other they should be snatched from me and brought up in popery. Nor would it have been much otherwise if he had been of any other irreconcilable opinion; for as I told you before, though I knew his opinion; for any opinion where there is not a harmony in worshiping and joining in public prayer to God and joint serving Him in our families is the same thing, only not in the same extreme."

Young people who disregard the Church's advice today often experience the same disillusionment. No small part of my correspondence is made up of letters dealing with the marriage of Lutherans and Catholics. I believe that I have received enough letters of warning from our young people who have married Catholics to fill a large book. Typical are the following excerpts:

"I am a Lutheran, thirty years old, married to a Roman Cath-olic. I realize that the marriage was a mistake. It might have been all right if there had been no child, but now that we have brought a girl into the world, we must find a solution. I went with my husband nearly eight years before my marriage, and in those years when religion in marriage was mentioned, he always said that he would turn, as his religion meant nothing to him. Of course, being young and in love, I believed him. Those eight years were happy ones, and his stubbornness did not show up. When the time for our marriage approached, he refused to be married in my church and insisted upon a Catholic ceremony. I declined to do this. My future husband then came to my home and before my parents promised that, if I would consent to be married before a priest and sign the papers, so that he could remain a Catholic, the children, if any, could be brought up in my faith. We were married in a quiet ceremony. Ten months passed. I continued in my church and Sunday-school and was very happy. Then my baby was born. I was nervous and not very well after her birth, and when the time came to have her baptized, he broke his promise and had her baptized by the priest. I was too sick mentally and bodily to fight when I realized what was happening. When the child grew older, I took her to church each Sunday with me and continued teaching her prayers and the stories of Christ. My husband did not approve, of course, and sulked for days at a time all through these years. His mother and sisters, who live next door, have twice given the child a rosary. The first time I just overlooked the gift and forgot it. The second time I asked them not to give her another. Of course, this greatly angered my husband and since that time there has been nothing but constant quarreling each time Sunday comes around."

"I am very much in need of your help. I am a Lutheran and have been one all my life. I married a Catholic ten years ago. When we started going together, he promised to join my Church. He even started taking instructions before we were married. We were married by a Lutheran minister; but after we were married, he stopped going to instructions. He would never go to church with me. But we lived happily until a year ago. Then we had trouble, and he left me. We went back together, and now he wants me to be married by a priest. If I don't, he says, we are to be parted again. He has been going to his church again but cannot attend the sacraments without being married by a priest. He and the priest insist on all the children's being reared Catholics. We have no children yet."

"I am a member of the Lutheran Church here, but I married a Catholic girl. I have tried my hardest to change her religion and have her join my Church, but she repeatedly refused. I can't face the people in our Church because of my marriage; so I don't attend any more. We both love each other, but the religious question, I am afraid, will break up our marriage if something isn't done about it. The question of children will arise sooner or later, and I wish you would inform me what to do about this. We promised each other that the children were to be neutral and choose their own religion, but it isn't fair to them."

"Two years ago I was married to a lovely girl who was a Cath-olic. I fought and fought for a civil marriage but finally succumbed to the proposition that our children could be reared in the Lutheran faith provided we had a Catholic wedding. My conscience tormented me after the ceremony. It killed every bit of her affection for me, and finally our marriage was wrecked through this and a few other difficulties. I am suing for divorce because she has left me and has refused to return. Of course, in all honesty I have made every effort to bring about a reconciliation. I wish to know how to unbind my conscience. I cannot attend church until all these threads of my life are back in harmony."

"I am a Norwegian woman, and I married an Irish Catholic man. We were married by a priest, and I signed a paper which said that, if we had children, they should be brought up as Catholics, in the Catholic religion. That was three years ago. Now we have a baby girl ten months old, and since the day she was born I felt that I could not consent to my husband's taking her to the Catholic church and having her baptized there. I know that you will think I should have thought of that before I was married, but I did not realize what I was doing at the time. My husband's priest has been to see me and says it is my duty to let my husband bring the baby up in his church as I promised to. The baby is now ten months old, and I know she should be baptized."

Because it is morally wrong for our young people to be married by Roman Catholic priests instead of their own pastors, to receive the five required instructions from the priest, and to promise to have their children baptized and reared in Roman Catholicism, the Lutheran Church has been emphatic in its warning against such alliances. Many of its congregations demand that members who have married Catholic life partners and accepted these conditions imposed by the priest must disavow these promises concerning children and acknowledge their wrong. Where this is not done, the offending members are no longer regarded as communicants in the congregation.

To prevent such spiritual disaster, however, every caution should be exercised. For the advice of those to whom the question of mixed marriage looms as a grave personal problem I suggest the following:

1.  Every member of our Church, pledged to its truth and its support, must earnestly and prayerfully resolve never to leave the Church through marriage.
2.  Our Christian young people who find themselves in love with members of other churches, particularly Roman Catholics, must inform the young man or young woman in question of their determined resolution to be married by their own pastor.
3.  If the Roman Catholic Church can insist upon a written statement from Protestants, we have as much right to demand a written pledge from Catholics who marry our members. This promise should embrace the statement that the Catholic party will not insist upon a second ceremony by the priest and that he regards this marriage as valid in every respect despite the teachings of his Church. The statements should further specify that children of this union shall be brought up in our faith and that no objection will be raised to this procedure. Besides, the assurance must be given that no pressure is to be exerted by the Catholic party in the effort to win the non-Catholic member for that Church.
4.  Our young people, should see to it that their life partner in a mixed marriage is consistently and tactfully given the Church's point of view, particularly through tracts, books, attendance at church services and adult classes. Lectures on the home and family worship have proved especially effective.

#### TRUE SPIRITUAL UNITY

While all compromise of Christian faith and conviction leads to indifference or spiritual tragedy, the tie that binds is the oneness which is crowned with true, spiritual unity. How refreshing, then, to read that at a recent convention of Lutheran stu-dents, representing especially the great Mid-Western universities of our country, there was one matrimonial issue in which all these college men and women agreed! With absolute unanimity they stipulated that the husband or wife of their choice must be a Christian and an active church-member. Ninety-three per cent insisted upon membership in their own Church.

Less decisive but significant is the result of a study conducted by Ray Erwin Baber (Journal of Social Hygiene, 1936, p. 117).

For a number of years Professor Baber has been offering a course on marriage and family life at New York University. Tabulating the attitude of 642 university students (321 young men and 321 young women from the junior and senior classes), he found that 42 per cent of the men and 58 per cent of the women said that they would not marry "a person of a different religious faith (Catholic, Protestant, Jewish) from their own." Even if they married a member of another Church, 91 per cent of the men and 95 per cent of the women refused to change their religion and adopt that of their mate. Investigating the attitude of 189 parents, Professor Baber found that 80 per cent of the fathers and 81 per cent of the mothers expressed their unwillingness to have their sons marry outside their religion. About 85 per cent of 220 parents expressed their disapproval of a mixed marriage for their daughter. Altogether the group of 642 college men and women regarded the same religious faith as more desirable than moral standards, wealth, age, and family, but as less essential than disposition and personality, health, intelligence, and education.

The wife of Matthew Henry, celebrated commentator of the Bible, had the right standard for gaging happiness. She was the only daughter of a wealthy merchant and the heiress to his estate, and when the young Henry sought her hand, the father objected that, while her suitor was scholarly, polite, and an excellent preachet, he was really a stranger to the family. "Why," the father insisted, "I don't even know where he comes from." "Quite true," replied the daughter; "but I know where he is going and would like to go with him." If two young people are completely agreed in their devotion to the Savior and know, beyond all doubt, that they are going to heaven, theirs is the greatest joy that God Himself can give to His children.

Because a heart-deep oneness of Christian faith reduces misunderstanding to a minimum, encourages a proper appreciation for the feelings of others, inculcates the essential virtue of unselfishness, and affords a spiritual basis for the strength and comfort of the soul, the religion of Jesus Christ has become a safe and sure stabilizer for the family. Offering the pervading presence of Christ, the Church tells all twentieth-century young people that there may still be a "home, sweet home" for them under the gracious guidance of their God, provided they resolve with Joshua of old: "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." If on the happy day when they kneel before the altar they take Christ with them as the Third in their union and pledge themselves to establish the family altar, to attend church regularly, to participate actively in the work of their congregation, to accept the Word of God as the guiding star through the besetting darkness that may enshroud their married life, they will have a home in which supreme human happiness may be found. This home may not have all the appointments and refinements which men are prone to prize; it may never be distinguished as the home of a leader in the world's intellectual, commercial, or industrial life; it may have no well-beaten path to its door as the habitations of the world's celebrities; but, above and better than all this, it will end the search for the benediction of peace; it will be a haven of refuge and a sanctuary of spiritual regeneration; it will, in short, be a temple of Christ. And they who live therein will be blessed, ineffably blessed, by His royal, redeeming presence.

### PIVOTAL PARENTS

Honor thy father and thy mother - Ex. 20:12

That grim truth is stranger than fiction was revealed by a harrowing tragedy in the remote Polish village of Zagajniki. There a plot regarded as preposterous in the dramatization of Henry Rostworowski, Polish author, was enacted by real flesh-and-blood characters. Andrew Cygan, the leading figure in this true-story drama, was one of the immigrant army who by hard work and thrift had found moderate success on the shores of golden America. After eighteen years of persistent plodding he decided to take a holiday and pay his aged parents in Zagajniki a surprise visit. About midnight, according to the Associated Press dispatch (February 20, 1931), which retells the story of the villagers, he knocked at the door of the parental cottage and was admitted without being identified, because the only light in the room, the feeble flame on the smoldering hearth, was too faint for the parents to recognize the matured features of their son. For some whim Andrew decided to pose as a stranger and amused the old folks by reciting the golden wonders of the New World. His bulging wallet apparently provoked an exchange of understanding glances between the old man and his wife; and at an unexpected moment the father seized an ax and brought it down on the stranger's skull. The next morning intruding neighbors found the father moaning over the corpse and clutching at official papers revealing his son's identity. The mother was insane.

A similar story, also emanating from the Associated Press, was carried in American newspapers during January, 1935, having been cabled from Gravisa, Yugoslavia. While skeptics may doubt the details in these accounts of "the native's return" motif, as the stories featuring this theme are called, the hideousness of parental murder is not unknown even in our own country. A startling document is the death-note of a distracted mother who placed her three children in bed, gave them sleeping-powders, turned on the gas, and went into an adjoining room to pen this confession of parental neglect before she returned to die with her children in the gas-filled chamber:

"I, —, do here set forth these facts: If I had done my duty, my simple every-day duty, as has my husband, —, we would now be a happy family. He was too good, letting me do as I liked. I slept and read and neglected the homely, every-day duties until I realized my children had not been trained properly. My heart broke; the fear of God came upon me, and I saw myself a lost soul in a broken body. I cannot let my children grow up in a world like this.

"Had I kept active in good work in home, church, and school, my life would have been spent, used, instead of lost. I am a disgrace to my kinsfolk, my family, my university where I studied, my friends, my church, my most courteous and considerate husband, and to humanity at large.

"Why, why, couldn't I have done my simple duty in the home? I have no excuse. I just failed to be a mother and home-maker.

"Surely America must have definite training for motherhood and home-making. I failed ignominiously.

"It is almost 12 midnight. I go now. I have sat here writing and have not looked at the children. What would I not give to be able to go back a few years and make a real home for them! The child's environment must have closer supervision, and parents should be compelled to live simple lives and provide the home and garden or yard required for the child's development. Lord's Prayer and 'Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep' is good, but it isn't enough. They must have protection, peace, and quiet, in the home. The environment must be one of loving-kindness and tender mercy. How did I miss the way?"

#### PARENTAL SELF-ABSORPTION

Less tragic but far more common is another type of parental killing. This leaves the body untouched, but chokes off the bloom of happiness in young people's lives by destructive indifference; and this is true particularly in matters of courtship and marriage. As inexplicable as this may be, parents are often completely unconcerned about the associations, pastimes, and heart problems of their sons and daughters. How many letters of almost inconsolable grief have come to me from parents who have seen the marriage of their children end in bitter failure! How much futile weeping would be stopped if parents always generously provided opportunities for the sympathetic exchange of confidences! The lamentable absence of heart-to-heart talks often results in actual estrangement between parents and children, making both lead separated lives, each with private ambitions and personal cares, — strangers under the same roof.

In an investigation which I conducted in one of St. Louis County's outstanding high schools attended by children from some of the best families in the community, it was found that more than half of the pupils were away from home between the hours of seven and ten on the night preceding the date of the questionnaire. While only twenty-seven of the approximately 300 boys and girls did not regularly frequent the movies, one third of the entire student-body went at least once a week and another third at least twice a week. Some found their way to the motion-pictures as frequently as four and five times a week. The most serious condition was revealed in the answer to the question: "Do your parents insist that you stay home a certain number of evenings each week?" Almost half of the entire high school indicated that parents imposed no restrictions but indiscriminately permitted their children to spend their evenings away from home.

Similar investigations in other sections of the country present even more alarming figures. A physical-education teacher in a Cleveland junior high school states that only 8 per cent of his 800 junior-high-school boys stay home nights. In The Second Line of Defense Margaret Slattery tells of a census embracing a group of homes with daughters ranging from thirteen to nineteen years. The investigation included sixty such families, but only five girls of this age were found at home between half past eight past nine in the evening.

Nation-wide attention was attracted by "The Case of Youth versus Society," a trial conducted by the Social Agencies of the Oranges and Maplewood, New Jersey, May 3, 1935. The indictment drawn up in strict legal form by a youthful grand jury presented among other the following counts:

"Society is indicted for indifference to, and ignorance of, the problems of youth in respect to

"Marriage (and the problems relating thereto):

"a. Inadequate instruction on the subject of choosing a mate.

"b. Allowing conditions to exist under which young people of marriageable age are unable to marry die to lack of employment."

"c. Inadequate sex education...

"Moral Code:

"a. Allowing the continued and flourishing existence of pitfalls for youth, such as obscene literature, saloons, and gambling devices.

"b. Failure to attempt serious moral education in the home, school, or church."

In the verdict, society was found guilty of inadequate instruction on the subject of choosing a mate but not guilty on the charge of failure to attempt serious moral education in the home, school, and church.

Would this "not guilty" verdict be sustained in other sections of the country?

While large numbers of young people would unquestionably resent any display of parental interest in their friendships, too many parents live on in stolid apathy concerning their children's companions. Here is the overbusy mother with a full routine of meetings and social functions that take her away from her home day after day. What if she does not know even the names of the young men who are seen in her daughter's company nor the places where she spends her evenings? The bravado of false security may try to quiet the voice of any surviving maternal conscience by insisting that her daughter is a good girl, that she is old enough to take care of herself, sensible enough to choose the right friends! Or here is the disinterested mother who is totally unconcerned about making the home attractive for her grown children or who refuses to permit them to entertain their friends at home. The inevitable consequence is that public dance-halls and centers of commercialized amusement are overcrowded, that a mother's influence, which should be a permeating force in the lives of her children and in the choice of their friends, often registers an absolute zero.

A few years ago the city of Houston was rocked by startling disclosures of moral delinquency particularly among young people of high-school age. Newspapers joined hands with city authorities and church officials to check the shocking conditions revealed by the official investigation. In reading the printed reports, one cannot but be reminded of St. Paul's catalog of the terrible sins for which he indicts the natural man. These young people of Houston ran through the whole gamut of passions and vice and so brazenly flouted pure, clear living that the city was gripped by the realization of debauchery in its midst.

It would be a mistake to localize these unfortunate occurrences in one city. We are convinced that they obtain in every large city. It would be equally unfair to ascribe these conditions to the influence of the high school. And it would be optimism that borders on the edge of blind credulity to assume that Christian young people are separated by an insuperable gulf from this contamination. In the whirl of worldliness earnest young people from the best of our Christian homes sometimes are removed by only a step from temptation and moral aberration.

Who, then, can be their guide through the maze of this lecherous environment? Who else than their divinely appointed guardians and protectors, their fathers and mothers, who have the charge to bring up their children "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord"? Students of the distressing situation in Houston found the parents at fault in many cases. The bishop of the Episcopalian Diocese of Texas charged: "The parents are to blame! The young people are just keeping up with their elders." The president of the Houston Ministerial Alliance declared: "The conditions do not show so much a breakdown in moral fiber as a delinquency on the part of their elders in showing the youth the right way to conduct."

For years, educators have been measuring the influences by which children's attitudes are molded and their ideals shaped. We have gone through an imposing array of suggestions in which psychologists and scientists and educational experimenters have listed diet, ventilation, schoolroom environment, physical characteristics, mental training, as among those human factors which most clearly influence youthful behavior and attitudes. This has been a fertile field in which the seeds of speculation have been sown with amazing abandon.

Now, however, a return seems to be in progress. Dr. John B. Morgan, professor of psychology at Northwestern University, expresses an opinion which the Christian Church has always endorsed, by reporting that "clinical studies and logical analyses have long given the home credit for the greatest influence in determining the attitudes and wants of the young child. But," he adds, "recent studies have shown that the home influence is even more significant and enduring than we supposed. With children from the fifth to the eighth grade it was found the dominant factor in the child's knowledge of right and wrong was the home, with the greatest influence coming from the mother." He unhesitatingly asserts that parental influences were found to be much greater than those of Sunday-school teachers.

Parents must remember that, whether their children spend their eternity in heaven or in hell, whether they rise to success or sink in failure, whether they find happiness or misery in the choice of a companion for life, depends to a large extent on their home training, the example of father and mother, the intelligent, sympathetic, unselfish interest which their parents display in the affairs of courtship and marriage. Parents are pivotal. Their children's happiness, the noblest issues in the lives of their offspring, revolve around the center of parental interest. One of the deep-grooved tragedies of our age is the unmistakable indifference on the part of parents toward this basic truth.

How encouraging is the contrast presented, for instance, by Mrs. Elias Compton, who holds the distinction of having received an honorary degree of LL. D. for "the success of her sons and daughters"! Besides, the American Mothers' National Committee of the Golden Rule Foundation named Mrs. Compton "the American Mother for 1939, representative of the best there is in woman-hood." She is the mother of this distinguished group of children: Dr. Karl T. Compton, president of Massachusetts Institute of Tech-nology; Dr. Arthur Holly Compton of the University of Chicago, Nobel Prize winner and cosmic-ray expert; Wilson Compton, Washington lawyer, economist; and Mrs. Charles H. Rice, wite of the principal of Ewing Christian College at Allahabad, India. With a marked modesty she describes her success and blessings in this short sentence: "I was guided by common sense and the Bible." Her husband, dean emeritus of Wooster College, filled in the details by stating: "Mother always begins the day with prayer. Though we have told that often, newspapers somehow never considered that news."

Happiness in the marriage careers of the children is promoted by the joy they have experienced in their homes and seen reflected in their own parents' lives. In a nine-year study of the factors that make or break marriage Burgess and Cottrell (Predicting Success or Failure in Marriage, 1939) show that the probabilities for gratifying marriage are increased whenever the couple's parents are happily wed.

#### FATHER, KEY-MAN IN OUR SOCIAL ORDER

Now, the mother is more important than the father, at least to girls of the teen age, according to Dr. Anne H. McAllister, in her report to the British Association for the Advancement of Science at its annual convention in Bristol, 1930. An examination of 253 original stories written for children by eighteen-year-old girls, future teachers in English schools, revealed that only one fifth of these stories mentioned the father at all and then usually as the parent administering punishment for wrong-doings. In the ordinary role of every-day life, fathers frequently have little time and less interest for their children. Miss Ellen Wilkinson, Labor member of the British Parliament, admired practically everything in America except this paternal indifference. Speaking over a radio network, she said: "I simply could not understand why, when American homes are so comfortable, American husbands seem to spend so little time in them. Why, if you are asked to stay in American homes, do you so rarely see the husband? There are intelligent daughters, gay, good-looking sons; but where is Father? American youngsters in their early-to-bed stage must think of Father as the voice at the other end of the telephone, for Father is always working. Perhaps one of the effects of our present depression will be to introduce these hard-working husbands to their charming families."

In a disproportionate manner mothers have consequently often assumed the practical direction of home-life, the husband sometimes being reduced to a mere provider, a general handy man for the family. Elsie Robinson, syndicate writer, scores the neglected paternal authority in this outspoken protest: "Mother-worship has become a vicious racket and wide-spread menace. There is indeed no nobler thing on earth than the love of a fine and intelligent mother. But there are several things just as noble — among them the love of a fine and intelligent father."

We have a Father's Day, of course; but how many of us know its exact date? Even a full-fledged holiday, with all attendant pomp and publicity, could not compensate for the lost authority of American fatherhood nor remove the social hazards created by the frequent eclipse of the American father, the key-man in the present social order.

We must remember that, according to divine social standards, fathers, not mothers alone, are given the command to bring up their children "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord" (Eph. 6:4). It is a false philosophy of home-life which develops this argument: "I earn the money for food and clothing and shelter, and my wife must do the rest. I look after the family interests outside of the home, while she directs its welfare within the home." Even the complexities of our modern life cannot bring exemption from the sacred responsibility of supervising the education, spiritual care, and moral growth of those in his household. Above the Chief Parts of the Catechism Luther placed the admonition that "a father should teach them diligently to his household." The great Reformer insisted: "No one should become a father unless he is able to instruct his children in the Ten Commandments and in the Gospel, so that he may bring up true Christians."

Fathers knowing that they are ordained by God to be the heads of their families must find time to meet the demands of their exalted position. If they are preoccupied with business or social obligations, some of these should be dropped.

Parental authority must be firm, though not tyrannical. Modern trends in child-training protest vigorously. A popular writer on questions of the home, for example, believes that the home is often "an autocracy instead of a democracy," and he rejoices that "heavy father stuff" is a thing of the past. But jurists who preside over juvenile courts, as well as social workers and pastors, who meet humanity at its worst, of course, tell us that the collapse of parental authority is one of the major factors in the staggering rise of youthful delinquency.

Men must retain a sympathetic feeling for their children's activities and find means of developing a happy companionship with their family. We are not, however, in favor of a loose familiarity. On the contrary, we agree whole-heartedly with Judge Aarons of Milwaukee: "Fathers are overdoing this pal stuff. When a father claps his hands on his boy's shoulders and talks the slang of the street with him, the father belittles himself, and the boy loses respect for his father. Fathers should not be knock-around pals with their boys, as some like to think, but there should be a fine, sympathetic relationship between the two generations."

Pointedly does Mrs. Compton say: "I'm a bit concerned about putting all the emphasis on the mother in the home. While I believe a mother's influence is strongest in the early years, I feel, too, that the sympathetic cooperation of the father is essential at all times. When a boy comes to a certain age, he feels his father knows better how to advise him along specific lines than does his mother. And, too, he is more apt to follow his father's example, even though his mother's influence continues throughout his years. I have known fathers to evade moral responsibility by saying, 'I leave it to my wife to train the children in morals and religion? I had a wonderful husband, who wielded great influence in the character-building of my children — a certain something that I as a mother could not give."

Fathers must give a stimulating example to their children, particularly in meeting their spiritual duties; for the word of paternal counsel will fail when contradicted by the life of the counselor. Every man should try to measure the personal importance of the Scriptural appeal: "Fathers, provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged" (Col. 3:21).

These principles accepted, the relation between fathers and children will be marked by rich blessings. Luther wrote to Melanchthon that everything he was or had he had received from his Creator through his beloved father. Theodore Roosevelt declared: "My father was the best man I ever knew." Albert Schweitzer, medical missionary and one of the most heroic characters of the present day, ascribes some of his happiest attainments to his Sunday afternoons with his father. Henry Adams praised the table-talk which he always heard in his parental home, and he said that his father had a more perfect equanimity than any other man he knew.

How stimulating is this reminiscence excerpted from the Memoirs of Prince von Buelow, a German statesman and diplomat of the last generation (Vol. 4, p. 21; translated by Geoffrey Dunlap and F. A. Voigt): "It is to my father that I chiefly owe my intellectual training. He laid the foundations of my education. I look upon the Bible and Homer as these foundations. My father called to mind the words addressed by St. Paul to his righteous son in spirit Timothy, to whom he wrote that all Scripture, given by God served for teaching, for punishment, for improvement, and for chastisement in righteousness... We read the Bible every day; and when I first went to school, I had already read the whole of the Old Testament and of course the New as well. I knew about fifty selected hymns by heart."

The world suffers because there are not more men who sustain memories in their sons' souls like those recorded in John G. Paton's Autobiography. As a boy this self-effacing missionary to the South Sea Islands used to crouch outside his father's prayer-or ate and linen to that spin al o this life. try vec in temple I hope that the Lord is more near, more visibly walking and talking with men, than under that humble cottage roof of thatch and oaken wattles. Though everything else in religion were by some unthinkable catastrophe to be swept out of memory, my soul would wander back to those early scenes and would shut itself up once again in that sanctuary closet and, hearing still the echoes of these cries to God, would hurl back all doubt with the victorious appeal, 'He walked with God; why may not I?' There were eleven of us brought up in a home like that. In this world and the world to come all the children of James and Janet Paton will rise at mention of their names and call them blessed."

Regina Hartmann, ancestress of the late Secretary Woodin, was reunited with her family by hearing the hymns which her father had taught her sung by her long-lost mother. It is to this same spirit of paternal devotion that many young people must trace the happiness of their own home-life.

Sometimes it takes the fear of sickness, parting, or death to bring fathers into the proper sphere of thought. When Charles Wesley was in his teens, he was placed before a vital decision. A wealthy Irishman had become interested in Charles because his name, too, was Wesley, Garret Wesley. This man was a member of Parliament and owned vast stretches of land. Having no children of his own, he sought to adopt Charles and offered him a beautiful home and the attractions of almost everything that money could buy. The lad was even given the assurance that, when Garret Wesley died, he would inherit all his land and money. In his excitement Charles wrote home to his father, a clergyman in a poor country parish with a small salary, which was to be shared by a large family. He, however, refused to influence him. As Charles reflected on the problem, the conviction soon grew within him that he could not forsake his own father, even for the attractions of wealth and comfort. His decision was quickly made, and he began a career which was to make him a great religious poet.

#### PARENTAL AUTOCRACY

Parental sin often lies not only in selfish absorption but also in autocratic dictation. Some parents selfishly make the home so uncongenial and assume such a domineering attitude in questions of their children's marriage that growing sons and daughters, eager to maintain their self-respect, find conditions intolerable and leave home. Captain John Ayres, in command of the Bureau of Missing Persons in New York City, which annually deals with 25,000 runaways, traces the fact that many young people are listed as missing to the uncongenial homes in which parents (particularly those from the Old World) try to wield absolute sway over their children's lives, without any consideration of their feelings.

Altogether too frequently parents become match-makers and, in accord with the matrimonial convention of a narrow age or a backward nation, select life partners for their children, disregarding entirely the latter's personal preference. In ancient Babylonia daughters were sold into matrimony-for-money alliances; in the Middle Ages, Elizabeth, wife of Landgrave Lewis, was betrothed to her husband in her infancy and at the age of four was taken in a silver cradle to the Wartburg, where she was to live in happy childhood with her future husband; and these made-to-parental-order marriages, while happily less frequent than in those past ages, still blight some youthful lives.

Modern parents may well be guided by the principles expressed in a letter from George Washington to his old friend Colonel Bur-well Bassett: "It has ever been a maxim with me through life neither to promote nor to prevent a matrimonial connection, unless there should be something indispensably requiring interference in the latter. I have always considered marriage as the most interesting event in one's life, the foundation of happiness or misery. To be instrumental therefore in bringing two people together who are indifferent to each other and may soon become objects of disgust or to prevent a union which is prompted by the affections of the mind, is what I never could reconcile with reason." (George Washington Himself, by John C. Fitzpatrick, p. 449.)

Some parents unhappily destroy the confidence of their children by persistently prying into their private affairs. In one of the syndicated columns of a metropolitan newspaper an indignant young lady writes: "I am a woman well in my twenties. I am intelligent, trustworthy and capable, hold down a good job, support myself, and pay my way at home. Nevertheless, my mother treats me as if I were a nitwit child of three, and she feels that she has the right to dominate my life in every way. She opens all of my letters and reads them before I see them myself, and frequently I have the embarrassment of having the family discuss the contents of my letters that I have not seen. Have adult children no rights as long as they stay at home?"

The answer obviously is that the children not only have rights, but especially also are entitled to trust and confidence in personal matters, at least until they show themselves unworthy. Many a weeping mother who laments that she is not understood by children and that they do not confide in her has destroyed that possibility by adopting gumshoe tactics or robbing her children of an honest sense of independence. While young people should never send or receive communications which cannot be read by other eyes, fathers and mothers should not insist upon censorship privileges nor, least of all, assume them surreptitiously.

Some parents have gone to the extreme of confiscating their children's letters. That spoiled the only romance in the life of Joseph Mallard Turner, England's greatest landscape artist. Early in his youth he met in Yorkshire the girl whom he learned to love deeply. Constantly he wrote her, filling the pages of many letters with expressions of his devotion. But the young lady's stepmother regarded Turner as only the son of an insignificant Maiden Lane barber, and she had little confidence in the ability of any painter to provide for her stepdaughter. So she intercepted all the letters from the young artist, who in a few years was to be elected to membership in the British Royal Academy. The girl, who interpreted the absence of letters as evidence of neglect, married another suitor and suffered much unhappiness, while disillusioned but illustrious Turner became a sullen recluse and a misanthrope.

#### "IN-LAWS" - DOMESTIC OUT-LAWS

Direction of children's affairs by inconsiderate parents becomes particularly dangerous after marriage, when, for example, a doting mother feels herself called upon to manage the affairs of the new household, to champion her daughter at the least provocation, and, generally, to inject her presence and advice - often an entirely unnecessary intrusion — into the affairs of the newly-weds. No nation-wide statistics present the percentages of blighted marriages by the interference of the "in-laws"; but Colgate University investigators, who sent out questionnaires to the married men and women in Who's Who in America, learned that slightly more than 25 per cent of the men answering and almost as many women listed as one of their chief marital difficulties - the second in importance in the entire list — the unwelcome interference of relatives through marriage. The American Association for the Advancement of Science on June 27, 1933, heard a report by Dr. Leonard S. Cottrell, Jr., of the University of Chicago, who analyzed the probabilities of successful marriage adjustments and presented statistics on the home-wrecking propensities of dictatorial mothers-in-law. When a young bride can toss a defiant head and assert with finality that she is going back to Mother, knowing full well that her indulgent parent will only fan the flames of her outraged feelings; or when a young husband is everlastingly beset by a jealous mama who can find no commendable qualities in the young woman of his choice; or when a mother-in-law swoops down upon the household that has not entirely emerged from its honeymoon enchantment and immediately assumes a self-appointed role of majordomo, even in matters of food and furniture, this domination may quickly become a contributory cause to marital discord.

Among the Yurok Indians on the lower Klamath River, Northern California (according to studies in marriage and kinship customs among these aborigines, published by T. T. Waterman and A. L. Kroeber), the brave who lives with his wife's parents or even near them is regarded as only half married. Wherever possible the Yurok bridegroom avoids remaining near his mother-in-law and father-in-law. It is only when financial embarrassment prevents him from paying the full bridal price that he is forced to enter into this "50-per-cent" marriage.

On the other hand, a Christian attitude will hallow this mother-in-law relationship. A reminiscence of Helen Chappell White draws this almost ideal picture: "I went to a funeral the other day, the funeral of a woman of nearly eighty, who had spent the last ten years of her life in her daughter's home, entirely dependent on that daughter and her husband financially, the most difficult and potentially unhappy position that any mother-in-law could face. And, believe it or not, the chief mourner at that funeral was her son-in-law, a big, husky chap, who broke down and sobbed like a baby. Afterwards he told me, red-eyed: 'Something has gone out of our lives and our home. She was a blessing to us all; it won't be the same without her.'

"Later the wife in this home added what was perhaps a very significant statement: 'My mother was a very unusual woman. She never criticized anything in our home. She never adopted an antagonistic attitude toward the activities of the young people. She never seemed to feel we were neglecting her when we were all busy. She had plenty of interests of her own and was good company for herself, glad to have us, but independent of us, too. She never demanded affection and attention as a right nor complained that we did not give her enough. And so, because she asked nothing, she got everything. Because her room was the happiest spot in the house, it was the one where we all liked best to gather. Because she was never harsh or unsympathetic but always kind and candid, we took her into all our problems and asked and accepted her advice.'"

Edgar Allen Poe loved his mother-in-law with an intense devo-tion, chiefly because she had given life to his beloved wife, Virginia. Let James A. Harrison (Works of Edgar Allen Poe, Vol. I, pages 182, 183) first describe Poe's deep-souled affection for his wife: "I have seen him hovering around her when she was ill with all the fond fear and tender anxiety of a mother for her first-born — her slightest cough causing in him a shudder, a breast chill, that was visible. I rode out one summer evening with them, and the remembrance of his watchful eyes eagerly bent on the slightest change of hue in that lovely face haunts me yet as the memory of a sad strain. It was his hourly anticipation of her loss that made him a sad and thoughtful man and lent a mournful melody to his undying song." And then read these lines from his sonnet written to Mrs. Clemm, the mother of his wife, Virginia:

TO MY MOTHER

Because I feel that in the heavens above
The angels, whispering to one another,
Can find among their burning terms of love
None so devotional as that of "Mother,"
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you,
You who are more than mother unto me
And filled my heart of hearts, where Death installed you,
In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
My mother, my own mother, who died early,
Was but the mother of myself; but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew.

This exemplary attitude is not inborn and natural. It must be acquired, and it is the ennobling Spirit of Christ who removes the stigma which the world has placed on the "in-law" relationship.

#### THE SINS OF THE CHILDREN

Far more disturbing than parental indifference and selfishness is filial aloofness. Because young people have never before lived their lives with the independence they enjoy today, many modern courtships completely ignore paternal opinion and maternal advice. A young man meets an attractive girl, and in a few weeks' time an engagement is announced, and the parents, without knowing whether the two young people are compatible, simply acquiesce and at best give their consent by silence.

Comparisons are generally odious, particularly when the halcyon days of yesteryear are compared with the present "utter degeneracy." Almost every generation has its "mauve decade," but the eye of memory is often blind to the decadence of its own past. Yet sometimes a deep-grounded appeal comes to us from the years that have gone before. In the early eighties of the past century Peal's Popular Educator, the official guide in matters of etiquette and general conduct a half century ago, suggests the following correspondence covering a young lady's falling in love while away from home:

"My dear Mama: I have a serious matter to confess to you, at which I hope you will not feel angry. It seems almost ungrateful to think of loving any one but you; but, O Mama, if you saw Henry Lenning, you would forgive me, I am sure. He is so handsome, so gentle in his manners, and yet so sensible and so accomplished! We met at a party given by your old friend Mrs. Grayson, and he scarcely quitted my side the whole evening. Mrs. Grayson has so high an opinion of him that she repeatedly invited him to her house, until his visits have become almost a daily occurrence. He is most honorable and straightforward and only waits permission to write to you in order to give you full particulars as to his condition and prospects. Forgive me, dear Mama, when I tell you that my feelings are deeply enlisted in his favor and that I feel as if much of my future happiness depended on our union. I wish you were here to counsel and advise me, for never before did I so much feel my own heart master of my reason. I hope you will write directly or come immediately to your affectionate, but anxious child, Minnie Howson."

To this the mother replied:

"My dear Child: Make yourself perfectly at ease as to my consent to anything that will promote your happiness. If Mr. Lenning proves to be what you represent, my fondest wish that you might meet a desirable partner in life will be realized. At the same time do not be too hasty to give an unqualified assent to his proposals but take time to study his character and disposition through a longer acquaintance. I shall be in Boston on the fifteenth, and I shall be delighted not only to meet my dear child again but to be introduced to the man whom she has thought so worthy of her affections. Your ever loving mother, Gertrude Howson."

Like the manufacture of Mesopotamian glaze and Egyptian dye, such solicitous exchanges of mutual confidences between mothers and daughters seem to have been irretrievably lost. In our breath-taking, speed-it-up age this lengthy heart-to-heart correspondence might be reduced to the following telegram, sent "collect" to the mother:

"Congratulate me. That mousseline-de-soie frock broke his defense mechanism. Wedding in June. Min."

#### THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE

Ultimately the choice of a life-partner is vested in the children, not the parents. Fathers and mothers sometimes assume this privilege, but inherently it is the sacred right of the son and daughter. Parents may object to the choice of a companion for life, but this veto should rest upon Scriptural grounds. For instance, if the proposed marriage disregards the forbidden degrees of relationship, Christian parents are bound by solemn duty to protest; or, again, if a Christian son would become allied with an unbelieving, scoffing wife, devoted parents, according to the Word of God, must do their best to dissuade him.

Unless Biblical support can be shown for parental opposition, it cannot be made a matter of conscience or claim validity in the Church. In a grasping age some parents are apt to insist on matches that are financially attractive but which utterly disregard the personal affection of their child. An instance of this not altogether infrequent attitude is described in the reminiscences of a busy pastor: "Only recently a young girl, but of marriageable age, came and confided to me a crushing burden. She had a lover to whom she was attracted. There could be no reasonable objection to her mar-riage, but her father stoutly opposed it on the ground that he needed her in his business. He was prosperous. He could afford to employ help, and his living would not be jeopardized if his daughter withdrew from his business. This father gave way to covetousness and for that reason interfered with the happiness of his daughter. I led her out into the light, helped her analyze the case, shed the light of the Bible on it. I told her that her father by his example in entering marriage weakened his own argument, - he had forsaken his parents, had established a new relation, — and that she had a perfect right to take the same step. I told her that parents may even forbid what God allows, that they may give way to sinful, selfish motives which will not stand in the sight of God. She left me comforted, and it was not so long afterward that she was led to the altar and has since become the happy mother of two beautiful children." (Schuh, Happy Family, p. 102.)

Children must always be guided by filial patience and respect; but when parental prohibitions are based on such superficial grounds as feudal dislike of the family into which their child is to marry, the inability to play the piano or show similar accomplishments, the claim of too much culture or not enough culture, social or occupational standing; when objections are based on personal whims and parental idiosyncrasies, they are not binding for Christian children, who, overriding these vetoes, may finally enter marriage without any qualms of conscience. As early as 1641 the code of laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony specifically provided that, "if any parents shall wilfully and unreasonably deny any child timely or convenient marriage or shall exercise any unnatural severity towards them, such children shall have free liberty to complain to authority for a redress."

A hundred years before that Pilgrim age Martin Luther, engrossed in the direction of world-moving concerns, paused to reprove a mother for selfishly withholding her maternal blessing. One of his protégés was John Schneidewin, who, like many others, apparently boarded with Luther while preparing for the ministry. John fell in love with the daughter of a Wittenberg citizen, much to the displeasure of his mother, who lived at some distance. In order to placate the maternal anger, Luther took the time to engage in this one-sided correspondence, which states clearly the Church's attitude on the wilful refusal of parents to sanction their children's choice:

"To the honorable, virtuous Lady Ursula Schneidewin, widow, citizen at Stollberg, my kind, good friend.

"Grace and peace in Christ! Honorable, virtuous dear Lady: I have written to you concerning your son John that he has conceived a great love for an honorable maiden here; and as you must have received my opinion, I hoped you might have given a favorable answer; but as the delay appears to me too long, I feel it necessary to urge you further. For I am not unfavorably disposed towards him and would not that he should be driven to despair. As, therefore, the maiden so greatly pleases him, is not unequal to him in station, it appears to me that you may well be con-tented, since he has humbled himself as a child and begged for the maiden as did Samson. Therefore it is fitting for you, as a loving mother, to give your consent; for though we have written that children should not betroth themselves without the consent of their parents, we have also written that parents, according to God's will, should not, nor can they, control or hinder their children at their own pleasure. No son should bring a daughter to his parents without their consent; but also a father should not force a wife upon his son. They should do their best on both sides; otherwise the son's wife must become the father's daughter without his approval. Who knows what happiness God may provide for your son by means of this maiden, which, perhaps, otherwise may be lost to him, especially as the good maiden gives fair hopes, is not unequal in station, and her sorrow might become a curse? In short, I beg you will no longer delay your assent, that the good fellow may be relieved from his disquiet. For I cannot delay longer but must take measures on account of my office. But I beg you will not let this letter be known to your son John; for he ought not to know it till the matter is settled that he may not be too confident and bold. For I love him, of which he is well worthy, on account of his goodness and therefore would not advise him to his harm. Therefore do your part as a mother and relieve him from this torment that he may not be obliged to act in spite of you. Herewith, God be with you! Amen.

"Wednesday after Trinity, 1539 Martinus Luther, Dr."

Despite this urgent appeal Ursula Schneidewin did not answer. With his characteristic patience Luther waited more than a month longer and then penned a third letter, from which these extracts have been taken:

"Grace to you and peace in Christ! Honorable and virtuous Lady. If I am not mistaken, I have written to you twice concerning your son John, who as a good son has begged you through me to show yourself a kind mother and give your consent to his marriage with this maiden, thereby doing his duty as a son.... I have also told you that I can no longer delay but think fit, as I propose to stand by him, that he should be delivered from this danger; for I see that his studies are hindered and that no good can come if you are so harsh with him. What I do is for your honor; she is his equal, the child of good people. Besides, you must bethink you that it is not bearable that the children of other people should be excited to love and afterwards be neglected without cause. This you would hardly suffer to be done by your own children; therefore it must not be, especially where it is a question of marriage. I have further written and advised that you should not refuse, so that we may not be compelled to proceed notwithstanding. ... It is so annoying to me that my boarder should delude our citizen's daughter that I again beg you will give a speedy, favorable answer; otherwise we must do what we can to prevent scandal. You have been sufficiently entreated. When parents will not decide, the pastor must... I will never, as long as I live, abandon John; nevertheless he himself will, God willing, prosper without my help. I therefore beg you will show signs of life; for I am weary of writing so often on a matter in which you have no reason to object... Herewith, God be with you! Amen. And a short, right answer from you.

"Thursday after Kiliani, 1539 Martinus Luther, Dr."

Even Christian parents require prayer to counteract the selfishness attached to the thought of parting from a devoted child. Robert Moffat, intrepid missionary, was in love with Mary Smith, who returned his affection. When Moffat was called to the wilds of South Africa, Mary's parents insisted that she remain in Man-chester. She was the only daughter, they reminded her, and they were growing older. How could they sacrifice her even for so worthy a cause as the conquest of heathen strongholds? So Moffat went out to endure the hardships of a pioneer missionary alone, consoling himself with the hope that some day he might be united with his loved one. The unwillingness of Mary's parents grew until finally she was forced to write the missionary that she could never go to Africa. Then letters that had been seven or eight months in transit arrived in Manchester from the mission-fields. They told unmistakably, although not in complaint, of hardship and loneliness; and they led Mary Smith's parents to reconsider their decision. On a December evening, kneeling in prayer before the fireplace, they fought their own desires and emerged victorious. Their Mary went to Africa and became the wife of the man who later translated the Bible into the language of his African followers and was the human agency in saving many souls for eternity.

#### "THOU SHALT HONOR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER"

In Christian families parents are prompted by love, guided by practical wisdom, and moved by unselfish considerations. Young people may not always be able to see their point of view at first, but larger experience, more mature judgment, and trust in the parental love and guidance will usually afford better understanding of the parental objections.

Some, of course, consider the honor due parents an outworn delusion. Dr. John Levy, assistant professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and head of the Child Guidance Clinic of that university's medical center, told a research clinic in New York City on February 15, 1936, that "the old conception of the child owing love and respect to them [the parents] as such, irrespective of merit, must perish. The child is an individual, owing allegiance to himself alone. The home exists solely to provide for the full personal satisfaction of all its members. A far cry, this commonplace of today, from the 'duty' of the child to honor his father and his mother."

Similarly Dr. John E. Anderson of the University of Minnesota deliberately tells parents: "Don't worry about obedience! The adult world pays seventy-five to eighty dollars a month for obedience, but for stubbornness, initiative, and enthusiasm it pays salaries in five or six figures." Now, however, comes Dr. Henry C. Link, director of the Psychological Service Center of New York City, and in his frequently printed and widely quoted Return to Religion he would restore parents to new and commanding heights of importance, particularly in the courtship and marriage of their children. Dr. Link is a scientist, not a preacher, and his religious ideals are far from ours. His testimony, therefore, in a certain sense, may be the more impressive to some. When he writes: "I have a great deal of respect for the old-fashioned procedure by which parents selected mates for their children and then told the young couple to make the best of it," and when he deliberately continues, "The privilege of selecting one's own mate or marrying at one's own pleasure is by no means an unmixed good" (quoted with permission of the publishers, The Macmillan Company), he throws a bombshell into the self-expressionistic tendencies our day.

A mere sense of gratitude should remove this selfish disregard of the parents. The American Research Foundation has shown that the average young person who reaches eighteen years in the United States represents an investment of $7,250. Included in this cost is the expense of being born and all other charges thereafter except that of education in the public schools. If even an appreciation of the love and labor which this figure involves is not sufficient incentive for the grateful regard of the parents, we have the verdict of the highest authority, the Word of God. According to this standard it is a sacred duty of all children to show uninterrupted love to the father and mother who gave them life, who sustained them during the perils of infancy, and who bequeathed to them many of their opportunities for happiness and blessing. The Bible sets no time limit for filial honor. Human legislation establishes various ages as the legal majority, when children can act for themselves; but there is no such absolute independence of action according to the Scriptures.

We read these ordinances of Scripture: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right" (Eph. 6:1). "My son, hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother, for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck" (Prov. 1:8). The commandment which demands honor and love of father and mother is, according to the apostle's explanation, the one commandment with a specific promise. Parents are pivotal, we repeat, and the warning of the ancient proverb that parental blessing builds the children's homes while their curse destroys them, presents a frequent synopsis of human experience. Prodigious leaders in every branch of human activity have freely acknowledged as one of the most vital human contributions to their preeminence and the happiness of their home-life the love and guidance of their parents, the solicitous prayers and the unflagging interest of a self-sacrificing mother, the generous, deep-rooted Christlike life of a devout father.

Conversely, no one can find any happiness in disloyalty to his parents. Esau's marriages to Hittite women were so completely against the advice and entreaties of his parents that Rebecca tells Isaac: "I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth" (Gen. 27:46); and Esau drops out of history, leaving no contribution to the affairs of men. Samson is attracted to a Philistine woman. His parents object, but he obstinately insists, and his protest against their authority submerges him in a deep sea of matrimonial woe. Today, to skip over the centuries, an investigation of the married life of 526 Illinois couples by Dr. Leonard S. Cotrell, Jr., of the University of Chicago, shows that, if the marriage is opposed by the bride's father, it has less chance to succeed.

An illustrative incident comes to us from the annals of American sport, the unfortunate error committed by a captain-elect of the University of California's eleven in an annual Rose Bowl classic at Pasadena. Picking up a fumbled ball and starting down the field, this young man began a run which has secured for him an unenviable distinction and an unwelcome niche in the Hall of Football Defamation. It was not his speed nor the distance of sixty-nine yards which he covered that made his run notorious. It was the direction. For, while 70,000 Californians rose up in frenzy and shouted their warning; while his distracted team-mates vainly called and pulled and pleaded, the fleet-footed center darted away from the opponents' goal and sped toward his own goal, in exactly the wrong direction.

Today, too, they fly on toward the goal of disappointment, these young people who have never learned to understand the severity with which the contempt of parents is penalized, when the force of this Old Testament threat asserts itself: "Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother; and all the people shall say Amen" (Deut. 27:16). What happiness is sacrificed, what lasting joy of life shattered, what high hopes of the future blasted away, by the refusal of young men and young women today to follow the footsteps of that divine Paragon, the young Christ, who "went down with His parents and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them"! (Luke 2:51.)

Notable literary characters have followed as far as possible the example of our Lord in showing reverence to their parents. We have this brief but expressive letter of devotion from the pen of Dr. Samuel Johnson, an eighteenth-century model letter for many twentieth-century sons:

"Dear honored Mother: Neither your condition nor your character make it fit for me to say much. You have been the best mother and, I believe, the best woman in the world. I thank you for your indulgence of me and beg forgiveness of all that I have done ill and all that I have omitted to do well. God grant you His Holy Spirit and receive you to everlasting happiness, for Jesus' sake!"

Sir James Barrie, Scotch novelist and playwright, has left us some very human, yet deeply spiritual, experiences. In his biography of his mother, Margaret Ogilvy, he says: "She begins the day by the fireside with the New Testament in her hand. It is old, with its loose pages beautifully refixed. It is mine now, and the black threads with which she stitched it are a part of its contents." When old age enfeebled his mother, his care for her comfort in-creased. He tells us: "My mother and I go up the stairs together. "We have changed places,' she says; that was just how I used to help you up; but I'm the bairn now.' She brings out the New Testament again. It is always within reach. And when she has red fone wong time, she is my a look, mo the say of to lang with no earthly listener. Often have I found her upon her knees, but I always went softly away, closing the door."

On the very last page of Margaret Ogilvy the famed novelist writes this summary: "Everything I could do for her in this life I have done since I was a boy; I look back through the years, and I cannot see the smallest thing left undone."

How many of us can truthfully record the same devotion? Yet most of us are blessed and strengthened by the same measure of mother's love. A short sentence like Barrie's "Everything I could do for her in this life I have done since I was a boy" means more than Mother's Day carnations, sentimental cards, and raucous nightclub tenors crooning stilted lyrics with the mother motif.

### THOSE WHO WAIT - AND WONDER

All things work together for good to them that love God - Rom. 8:28

For the first time in twenty-one years the number of marriages in the United States fell below the million mark when in 1932 a new matrimonial low was reached at 981,759 marriages. Since 1887, according to Miss Alice Hagan, keeper of the marriage and divorce statistics in Washington, the rate has never been less than 8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants. But starting with 1929, as a consequence of economic upheaval, a steady decrease has been recorded. In that year the rate was 10.14; in 1930, 9.15; in 1931, 8.54; in 1932, 7.87. Only ten of the forty-eight States in the Union, each bordering on States with new and stricter marriage laws, showed even a slight increase.

In my own Church the number of marriages suffered a proportionate 25-per-cent reduction in the period from 1905 to 1933. In 1905 the number of marriages was 2 per cent plus of the number of communicants. In 1933, however, the number of marriages was 1.05 per cent of the number of communicants.

In the years since 1932 the rise in the number of marriages has been so rapid that not even economic improvement offers adequate explanation. In 1935 1,327,000 marriages were solemnized in our country, an increase of more than a third of a million marriages over the 1932 figure.

Despite the continued rise of matrimonial ratios the United States has more unattached young people of marriageable age today than ever before. A survey of the young men and women within the circles of my correspondence reveals many girls with positions of importance in the business world who would gladly exchange their vocational opportunities for a happy home, but who are without definite matrimonial prospects: unnumbered college women and school-teachers, ready to admit that "the right man" might be a farmer, a bank clerk, a shopkeeper, or an underpaid preacher, yet who seem unnoticed by the host of eligible males; young men — and their number is larger than the cynical-minded concede — who are eager for a happy marriage, yet, having only a few acquaintances among the fair sex, seem unable to make progress on the path to the altar. We see, in short, vast numbers of potential husbands and fathers, wives and mothers, splendid Christian young folk, who yearn for marriage but apparently in vain. And these well-balanced, head-in-the-air young men and women, earnestly praying to their God for true, Christian helpmates, yet passing one milestone after another as the twenties give way to the thirties without receiving an answer to their appeal, — this army of the unmarried, yet marriageable submits one of the most serious of all our practical problems.

#### THE PROBLEM STATED

It has been my repeated experience when speaking to youth groups throughout the country on questions of hearth and home that young women — not the self-asserting, querulous type, but whole-hearted, salt-of-the-earth girls— have presented a frequent, yet highly perplexing angle of this problem. They frankly say in effect: "The Church tells us that marriage is an institution of God, given for the benefit of His children. We agree fully. The Church further tells us that the ideal marriage, and the union which has the promise of divine blessing, is the life companionship of two sincere Christians. Once again we agree. But within this circle of our choice we find the young men often quite disinterested or without those qualities which we want in prospective husbands."

Specifically this problem is aired in an open letter published by the Chicago Tribune, May 14, 1933, — a self-portrait by a forgotten girl:

"I am an office-worker, twenty-four. Up till now I have never had a beau. I get so despondent sometimes hearing the girls tell about the good times they have had on dates. I see them being taken to lunch, to dinner. I hear of their getting flowers, nice little gifts, attentions of all kinds.

"On looking over my life, I cannot seem to lay a finger on the trouble. I guess I must have been born this way. I am no beauty; but when I look around at some of the girls being escorted here and there, I can't fairly charge my misfortune to my ap-pearance. I'm average; neither beautiful nor ugly but presentable enough.

"I think when I was born, it was without that certain spark of what might be called glamor, or whatever it is, that attracts men to girls and makes them want to see them after office hours. I'm not an old-fashioned girl, although it looks as if I'll be an old maid. .

"The girls in the office seem to like me. They like to lunch with me. I am always included in their after-office outings. I pride myself on the fact that I am considered a good sport in the office by both girls and men. I can take a lot of fun without being touchy.

"The whole pain lies in the fact that I do not appeal to men in the feminine way. They would never think of buying me flowers, although nothing I can think of would give me more joy than to be the recipient of even one small rosebud. (Now I'm giving away the sentimental side of my nature.) It hurts me when I am passed up and left decorating the walls. I grieve in secret about this. I would do anything within my power to change. But I don't know what to do.

"I get along fine in my work. No deficiency in gray matter there, if I can believe what I hear. But I wonder sometimes if I am not a little below normal in this other respect. Sometimes it seems as though every other girl in the world has an escort but me, and it's awfully hard medicine to take. Only a girl who has been or is a wall-flower can know what it all means.... Anne Waters."

The reason for situations like this is not to be found in the theory that there are more women in our country than men. Contrary to popular opinion the wisdom and power of God are strikingly illustrated in the generally equal-number ratio of sexes. Actually our country has more males than females. The statistics tabulated in the 1930 census show 37,056,757 men over twenty-one years in the United States with 35,886,867 women in the same category. Only in the urban population do the women above twenty-one outnumber the men: 22,149,447 to 21,747,237. In eleven States: New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Con-necticut, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, the women have a slight majority, but in the other thirty-seven the men enjoy a numerical edge.

Nor is this surplus of unmarried women to be ascribed solely to the disturbed economic order. The consequence of any nationwide financial upheaval, of course, is the postponement of marriage. Yet even our money difficulties cannot completely account for the number of these unmarried young women.

Finances sometimes do play a disconcerting role, however, notably when the young woman is economically independent. A girl with a position commanding a generous salary may learn to her dismay that her income has discouraged the attention of a young man who, climbing on the lower rungs of business success, earns perhaps only half as much as she does. One finds many courageous marriages in which this barrier has been swept aside by strong love; but it is evident that high salaries have helped to swell the number of unmarried women.

A further factor in the enlargement of bachelors' and spinsters' ranks is the mistaken policy which insists upon matrimonial standards attainable only in the rarest instances. This attitude is often a consequence of certain trends in higher education. Some time ago Dr. Katherine Bement Davis in Harper's Magazine discussed the prevalence of spinsterhood among educated women. Basing her findings on ten years' activity as general secretary of the New York Bureau of Social Hygiene, supplemented by statements of 1,200 college women, she summarized: Less than 1 per cent of these college women preferred freedom to marriage; yet 28 per cent made the explanation, "Never met the right man." But lack of social opportunities to meet men has been the lot of only few. Preoccupied with cultural studies, their mind has been weaned from the matter-of-fact concerns of daily existence. Consciously or unconsciously they have neglected some of life's commonplaces and essentials. They have acquired an academic disdain for the routine of domestic duty. Perhaps without their knowledge and against their intention they have enshrouded themselves with a nimbus of self-confidence, which in turn provokes an inferiority complex in would-be suitors. Many young men maintain their very respectful distance from the college women coated with the bright armor of intellectual superiority.

Deep below the cold compilation of facts in American Women (second edition, 1937-38) lies a pointed lesson: Only 43 per cent of the 7,851 women, America's feminine leaders, are married, although only 89 of the 7,851 are under thirty. The path to feminine distinction in the majority of cases is not the path to the altar.

W. J. Ballinger, formerly professor of economics at Smith College and since 1937 economic adviser of the Federal Trades Com-mission, speaks very emphatically on this subject (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, May 9, 1933): "Education for women in America is a tragedy. That tragedy is twofold. In the first place, so many of our educated women are being deprived of an opportunity to marry. This is due to the antimarriage nature of the educational process through which they pass. In the second place, our women's colleges, by their failure to train women for marriage, have done endless harm. They have by their intellectual prestige held back in our educational system any attempt to recognize that a training for marriage should be an important goal in our civilization... Taking the college graduate thirteen years out of college, I find that one college claims that 65 per cent of its graduates are married This was the highest record I could find. Yet for women of the nation as a whole, that is, women of the comparable age of thirty-four, I find that nearly 85 per cent are married. It is perfectly clear that our college graduates do not marry as often as their uncollegiate sisters."

One of the reasons the matrimonial rate is not higher among our school-teachers is unquestionably the fact that their occupational activities involve restrictions not imposed on many other women. The stenographer, the factory worker, the saleswoman, usually meet people and are enabled to form wider circles of friendship than those enjoyed by the school-teacher despite her intellectual equipment.

Some girls have themselves to blame. They think stiff formality is a virtue and often become untrue to themselves. They hide an honest, open, friendly attitude beneath the mask of distance and austerity, only to find that their attempt to maintain dignity and poise has been misinterpreted as forbidding aloofness.

#### NO MARRIAGE MARKETS!

This problem of meeting eligible suitors is by no means new, and custom has endeavored to cope with it in many interesting ways. The Bosnians, for instance, maintain a marriage market at Sarajevo, where Archduke Francis Ferdinand was murdered in the prelude to the war, in 1914. On Easter Monday morning candidates for domestic bliss stream into that city from the surrounding country-side. With pronounced self-consciousness the girls, dressed in their finest costumes and displaying their dowry in golden coin jewelry, stroll through the streets of the bazaar. Bosnian swains look on as the marriage parade passes and later, after appropriate choice is made, settle the marriage on a cash basis.

Such exhibitions are generally ruled out by our Western conventions. The nearest survival is found in France, where November 25 is dedicated to St. Catherine. In the hagiology of the Roman Church, Catherine of Alexandria was sainted because she suffered martyrdom in the third century. The custom of addressing a prayer to her, particularly in time of trouble, developed because tradition said it was she who appeared to Joan of Are and encouraged the Maid of Orleans in her darkest hours. Probably the fact that she never married was due to her unapproachable demands. As a schoolgirl she insisted that her future husband be of noble birth, a king in his own right, attractive enough to delight the angels, and of a complacent, all-forgiving nature. Gradually unmarried young women began to associate her with their own problems of marriage, and at an early date she became patron saint of the unwed. On St. Catherine's Day single young women have the traditional right of donning a St. Catherine's bonnet and proposing marriage to any man they meet. The Catherinettes sweep down along the boulevards in the annual husband hunt, and for one day, or rather one evening, Paris is theirs. We are assured that this custom is not without tangible success in the promotion of marriage. In a recent year, the newspapers report, the festival led to a marriage increase of 10 per cent in the following December.

On St. Catherine's Day in England unmarried young women gather in old Milton Abbey to ask:

A husband, St. Catherine;
A handsome one, St. Catherine;
A rich one, St. Catherine;
A nice one, St. Catherine;
And soon, St. Catherine.

The idea behind St. Catherine's Day has long been practiced at least in one section of Asia. Among the most progressive and prosperous of Mother India's 350,000,000 children, travelers tell us, are the inhabitants of the kingdom of Travancore. Strange to say, this is one district of India in which women are supreme; for while in some places the Hindu wife is so completely subjected to her husband that she is not supposed to eat at the same table with him or even look him full in the face, in this province matriarchy, the rule of women, has survived to a most remarkable degree. Significantly the Travancore woman selects her own husband.

Sociologists throughout the Western world are wondering whether this idea could not be introduced successfully in the Occident, particularly in view of the increasing number of unmarried young people. German maidens, weary of the indirect methods, organized a campaign for the establishment of "leap week," seven days each year during which it shall be their privilege to propose marriage.

A group of professional entertainers in New York presented to Mayor La Guardia a petition for a St. Catherine's Day in New York, an innovation, it was claimed, which would relieve the plight of lonely women in that city. In their address to the mayor they declared: "We believe that there are many fine young women in New York compelled to forego male companionship through circumstances beyond their control. In their behalf do we petition you to make it possible for these persons to meet and know promising young men under conditions that are wholesome and with the approval of the general public." This extension of the leap-year privilege has received strenuous endorsement.

A Chelsea, Massachusetts, woman recently went to Washington to request a national bachelor-maiden day and to tell some of the legislators: "We should honor those men and women who through righteous obligations and love of service have sacrificed the pleasures of parenthood but have shared equally in its problems and responsi-bilities." As the beneficiaries of this proposal all unmarried men and women in the nation (of marriageable age) are grouped in these classifications: Uncles and aunts; sisters and brothers; nephews and nieces; daughters and sons; various assorted cousins. It has been suggested that June 27 be set aside annually for this day.

The noted naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, a contemporary of Darwin, argued that things will not be right in the family until the woman does the choosing. Dr. Frederick Lent, president of Elmira College, New York, the oldest college for women in the United States, challenged: "Why should a woman have to wait until some man asks her to marry him? Why should she not have the right to look for a good husband the same as a man has to look for a good wife?" Others suggest an aggressive policy. Miss Helen Gwynne, retiring president of the Y. W. C. A.'s national industrial assembly, in her valedictory advised working-girls to be flashy, to wear gaudy clothes, as an aid to matrimonial ends.

We recall a lesson of warning from the ancient art of fishing. Some of the largest and wariest trout often are brought in by gray, drab flies, while a red flannel rag will almost always attract a bull-frog. The girl who is indiscriminate in her determination "to get her man" by corralling a large retinue of admirers and who makes undisguised advances may momentarily bask supreme in the spotlight of popularity; but when the more serious issues of life present themselves and the paramount question of finding a companion for the weal and woe of an entire career demands an answer, this self-assertiveness definitely works to her disadvantage. Most of us feel an instinctive agreement with the opinion of Fanny Heaslip Lea, popular author, who declares: "I cannot believe that women would ever welcome the initiative in the matter of marriage proposal. Foolish the woman, foolish beyond description, who wants to exchange her privilege of being courted for the right to court! She forgets that, if woman proposes, man will, without scruple, be able to refuse. The women whom men want they will always lay siege to; the women whom men do not want men will not have at the point of a gun. Man does not worship the too readily accessible."

#### MAIL-ORDER MARRIAGES

We are not so far advanced that warnings against these crudities are superfluous; for a marriage mart much larger than the alleged Babylonian bride market of which the Greek historian Herodotus tells is being conducted today in our own country. Professional marriage managers publish a string of periodicals chiefly to advertise the attractions of marriage-minded women; and it has been estimated that no fewer than 100,000 clients are listed in the various marriage bureaus. These advertisements are not clothed with the attempt at delicate subtlety printed in a Philippine newspaper:

"Being aware that it is indelicate to advertise for a hus-band, I refrain from doing so; but if any gentleman should be inclined to advertise for a wife, I will answer the advertisement without delay. Am young, domesticated, and rather good-looking."

Nor are they as objective as these typical advertisements taken from the largest daily newspaper of South India:

"Wanted, young Brahmin graduate, non-Sankriti Gotra, to marry beautiful, accomplished Brahacharanam girl, 18. Facilities offered for advancement in life."

"Wanted for a fair and beautiful Madhva bridegroom, aged 24, holding independent position, a fair and respectful bride. A dowry required. Apply with horoscope."

"Inquiry from influential circles regarding marriage of a Vaishnavite girl (14) of distinguished parents is invited. Good personality and academical equipment to start well in life must meet with encouraging response."

"Wanted, a Smartha Vadama Brahmin bridegroom, aged 20 to 25, of respectable family, educated and well settled in life, for a fair, well-accomplished girl aged 14 of the same sect. No objection to widowers below 30 in decent position, with no encumbrances. No Varaaskshina. Apply with horoscope and full particulars."

Our marriage advertisements are boldly printed under headlines like this:

#### "WON'T YOU WRITE A LONELY MAIDEN?"

"The ladies whose photos and descriptions appear herein have registered with us for the purpose of receiving letters from gentlemen and becoming married. One dollar pays for the names and addresses of all lady advertisers in this issue. After you receive their names, you can make your own selections, writing to as many as you choose. Many of these ladies are very lonely and are anxiously waiting to hear from some gentleman who is sincere. By securing their names and addresses at once, you may have the first chance of corresponding, exchanging photos, calling on them, etc. We cater only to ladies of wealth and refinement, and our service gives you the opportunity of a rich marriage."

Under picture purporting to exhibit the charm of the eligibles, the reader meets brazen bids for marriage, which outrage every element of propriety.

Entirely apart from the repulsiveness of such advertising is the long list of serious objections to the procedures of these marriage markets. Experience has proved that their advertisements are often wilful misrepresentations and deceptions. The annals of criminology have recently associated some atrocious murders with such matrimonial correspondence; and the soul-suffering provoked by professional marriage managers (some of whom draw $9,000 a year according to the confession of the director of the Widows' and Widowers' Club in Brooklyn, New York) completely overclouds any shadow of happiness which may be experienced by two lives brought together through this outrage against common decency.

Young people who feel tempted to enter into one of these correspondences simply "for the fun of it" should take to heart the words of the Evangelist T. Dewitt Talmage: "Avoid all proposed alliances through newspaper advertisements. Many women, just for fun, have answered such advertisements and have been led step by step to catastrophe infinite.... Do you answer them just for fun? I will tell you a safer and healthier fun. Thrust your hand through the cage and stroke the back of a cobra from the East Indies. Put your hand into the mouth of a Nubian lion to see if it will bite. Take a glassful of Paris green mixed with some delightful henbane. These are a safer and healthier fun than answering newspaper advertisements for a husband or wife."

Evidently the postal authorities of the United States share this opinion. The Post Office Department has issued a statement disavowing any responsibility for the unhappy consequences of mail courtship. A section of this statement warns: "In the legal opinion of the Post Office Department almost daily letters are received from deserted brides, distraught and frantic in their misery, asking for governmental assistance in locating runaway husbands and pleading for aid in prosecuting them. In some instances these wives blame the postal service for their marital woes, demanding redress and claiming that, as they were wooed entirely through the mails, the Post Office Department is directly responsible. An excerpt from one of these letters, typical of all the others, reads like this: "I want to know whether I can start suit against my husband. We married through a correspondence club advertised in the newspapers, and he sent me money by a post-office money-order to come and marry him. He also courted me by mail. After the wedding he failed to support me and take care of me and finally left me altogether. I want to know whether I can do anything through the Post Office Department, as our business, such as arranging for marriage details, was transacted entirely by mail.'" (Release of July 31, 1922.)

#### CANDID ADVICE

The candid counsel that a practical, Christian interpretation of life extends to those who wait and wonder must be this: Do not be guilty of the distasteful mistake of making yourself obvious or of thinking that popularity comes with boisterous self-assertiveness and a parade of your attractions! Do not make the opposite mistake of absenting yourself from those places and pastimes where young men or young women of desirable eligibility can find you! Go places, do things, meet people!

Not long ago a lonely person in Wisconsin wrote the Milwaukee Journal to ascertain where and how it would be possible to become acquainted with young people. An alert girl wrote in a quick reply, inviting her to attend her church and to become acquainted with the work of the Walther League, the young people's society in her congregation. Similar advice, if persistently followed, would extricate many young people from self-imposed isolation and afford the opportunity of finding desirable friends under the best sur-roundings. If the young people's societies of the Church did nothing more than offer each member occasion to mingle with a fine class of responsible young people, this contribution alone would justify their existence.

#### ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE UNMARRIED

Nor must we lose sight of the fact that, while marriage itself is a magnificent gift of God's grace, it is not indispensable for happiness. Notables in every walk of life have remained unmarried. A casual perusal of the famous bachelors of history recalls Washington Irving, author and diplomat, beloved at home and abroad; Charles Lamb, who remained single partly because of the fear of hereditary insanity, but whose essays of geniality and charm are treasured by the English-speaking world; John Keats, whose poetry has first place among the romanticists, but who had to forego marriage with Fanny Brawne because of his consumptive condition; James Buchanan, who attained to the highest office within the bestowal of our country, being our nation's only bachelor President; Leonardo Da Vinci, the great painter and scientist; Michelangelo, the Titan genius in marble, tempera, and stone; Sir Joshua Reyn-olds, portrait painter, who ranks with Gainsborough among the great British masters; William Pitt, Prime Minister of England at twenty-four, who once loved a girl but lost her and then lived with only one consuming desire for the rest of his life — the prosperity of Great Britain. In the musical world alone we have these striking figures: Johannes Brahms, whose life's motto was Frei, aber froh ("Unmarried but happy") and who immortalized the initial letters of his motto in the F-A'.F theme of his Third Symphony; Franz Schubert, the greatest song-writer in the musical world; Handel, who nearly married twice and who refused the position as organist and successor of Buxtehude when told that his appointment demanded that he marry Buxtehude's daughter. In the present decade we are reminded of the late Sir Thomas Lipton, Irish tea merchant and yachting sportsman, who was spurned by a Scottish lassie.

Another survey of famous personages among unmarrid women lists Charlotte and Emily Bronte, English novelists; Emily Dickin-son, one of America's great poets; the renowned Florence Nightin-gale; and the late Jane Addams of Hull House fame.

Young people with a Christ-directed perspective of life will realize that the attainment of the best in life can be reached entirely apart from marriage. Christians who live on year after year without marital prospects should strive for the faith which enables them to come before their heavenly Father with the declara-tion: "Thou doest 'all things well'" (Mark 7:37). They should voice their prayers to Him who directs the destinies of His children and under whose guidance two hearts are finally united. They should trust in His divine wisdom and believe His pledged assurance that, whether married or unmarried, "all things work together for good to them that love God" (Rom. 8:28). They should accept the full joy of their consecrated, Christ-centered lives.

## COURTSHIP, ENGAGEMENT AND MARRIAGE

### "KEEP THYSELF PURE"

Create in me a clean heart, O God! - Ps. 51:10

"The moment of formal betrothal is time enough for the first kiss." - This is not a maxim from a Puritan copybook nor a motto from the austere days of samplers. Neither is it the pronouncement of a world-weary octogenarian counselor of youth. It is rather the deliberate verdict of one of America's foremost psychologists, a literal quotation from William McDougall's Character and Conduct of Life (p. 219).

Few earnestly spoken opinions from eminent sources will evoke more challenge. Yet the principle Dr. McDougall enunciates and the protest which he implies merit the approval of every young life that would scale the highest heights of human happiness.

#### EXPONENTS OF UNRESTRAINT

The author of Proverbs lists three things too wonderful for himself and four which he knows not (chap. 30:19). This quartet of enigmas includes "the way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid." Commentators have expressed contradictory interpretations in explaining the last and oft-quoted phrase; but whatever its meaning, "the way of a man with a maid," the conduct characterizing the relation between the two sexes, has today become the topic of long-drawn debate.

Those who endorse an unrestrained relation between young people will immediately assert the utter futility of the restrictions which Professor McDougall implies and which the Christian Church has always regarded as ideal. We shall be accused of closing complacent eyes upon glaring evidence; we shall be charged with ignorance of modern trends; we shall be labeled as harmless idealists, with a code of conduct which no modern young person takes seriously. Young people themselves will complain that, if they maintain this reserve and refuse to make concessions to the spirit of the day, they will soon be ostracized. Young women, embittered by experience, will declare that young men take altogether too much for granted, insisting on intimacies even at the first meeting. And in answer comes the countercharge that the man who does not bestow his caresses lavishly must face the social blackball.

The managing editor of a student publication in a large Eastern university asserts that the girl who will not permit liberties "from any fellow who pleases her these days is non-existent." A questionnaire sent by Doris Webster and Mary Alden Hopkins to college students, social-registerites, and members of "cultured society" — groups representing 20,000 young people from Beacon Street, Boston, to Telegraph Hill, San Francisco - reveals, it is claimed, that the average "nice girl" in these circles is far from restrained in her relation with young men.

Sweeping assertions are always hazardous; and while no one who understands today's youth will be inclined to minimize this day's trends, we must not hesitate to say, in the face of an avalanche of contradictions, that this unrestrained attitude is not as universally prevalent as it may seem. No small numbers of young men and women, some even without the Church, have consistently respected the boundaries of a friendly reserve. A book bearing on this question that has attracted wide attention is Thoughts of Youth, by Larry. It is essentially the diary of a student at Lafayette College, compiled from his correspondence. In one of his letters we find these meaningful side-lights on Larry's type of college morality (p. 11): "I told you that Hart had made dates with three girls for us (Hart, Bob, Tinsman, and me) for last night. All three girls are juniors in the high school and are very nice; in fact, they are nicer than the average by a good deal. Perhaps it is because they are so unsophisticated. Anyway we played bridge with Mr. and Mrs. Whitzell (something like that), who are very fine people. Mrs. Whitzell is especially nice, and she kept the bunch pepped up every minute. After we had some sandwiches and cocoa, she went to the piano and played our 'Alma Mater' and other songs, and we all sang. It really was lots of fun. It was so nice and different from most parties, where the mother and father never show themselves for fear they are butting in. I am afraid that I am hopelessly simple and out of fashion and uncollegiate, but I can't enjoy a gang that lives on nothing but mushing and necking and who have absolutely nothing inside their upper stories but nonsense."

We find no reason to assume that this is an isolated attitude maintained by an exceptionally high-minded young man. Any one who has worked with the young people in church groups or in some of the other organized youth interests knows that thousands of splendid young people are motivated by similar ideals. Besides, moral issues cannot be decided by mass actions nor majority vote. The excuse "Everybody is doing it!" can be decisive only to a shallow, blow-with-the-wind mentality.

Nor are the other arguments in behalf of this new freedom of stronger force. Champions of these promiscuous pastimes solemnly assure us that they are character-builders! Harry Elmer Barnes, Russell, and a host of like-minded destructionists emphasize the desirability of premarital experiences. A director of religion in a California college believes that the free-and-easy girls can stiffen "their moral fiber in the exercise of their freedom." He presents, it seems, a Pacific Coast adaptation of the old fallacy that in order to know wrong one must do wrong. Just how a girl who has gone through a series of affairs with a half dozen young men can emerge purer, stronger, and better is a mystery which this academic oracle neglects to solve.

#### CHEAP — VULGAR — SORDID!

In this casual love-making the very cheapness of indiscriminate intimacies constitutes one of the most serious charges. When two young people who have enjoyed only a short acquaintance quickly drift into a situation where physical favors are freely asked and just as freely given, the inevitable consequence is the caricature of true companionship, the coarsening of ideals, the cheapening of high emotions.

Even the worldly-wise philosophy which is not moved by motives decisive for the Christian finds this wholesale love-making tawdry, offensive. A feature-writer noted for her sophistication tells the girls in her syndicated circle of readers: "If 'murmurous' is the most beautiful word in the English language, as has been decided by a London authority,... certainly the ugliest, cheapest, and most vulgar word is 'necking.' Doesn't the very sight of that word in print give you a nauseous feeling? If you are sensitive to words, it does: And so does the silly word 'petting.' That simply cannot be idealized, even by adding soft music and moonlight. It is cheerfully and meekly accepting the scraps from the table of a man's affections. It is admitting that you are delighted to be 'anybody's darling' for the evening or the weekend party. It is accepting a 'hand-out' instead of demanding an engraved invitation to the love-feast. It is giving yourself away like a premium or a tobacco coupon. It is not clever nor beautiful. It is just sloppy and childish — and cheap! It is just the sport of cheap sports!"

If even the sense of worldly propriety is outraged, there should be no indecision on the part of the Church. Because the happiness of any individual, the felicity of any family, and the moral progress of any nation depend upon a worthy appreciation of pure love, the clarion call of the Church must reach its youth with this high-souled appeal: God has endowed you with the bloom of youth and the nobility of love. Treasure this as your greatest human gift and for the sake of your own welfare never, especially not for the enjoyment of a momentary pleasure, permit yourself to become involved in any procedure which would tear the exalted emotions down to the sordid level of cheap, tawdry trifling. If you cannot always be popular, you can be right; and if you are right, you are with God; and if you are with God, all of life's intricate designs will be woven together into a sublime symmetry by the Master Weaver of souls.

It is sometimes said that protracted indulgence in familiarities may be detrimental to health; and we leave it to physicians to show how the continued concession to these impulses may work havoc with the nervous system. But even if these physical consequences are avoided, the seemingly insignificant start of lax relationships may lead to the ruthless fracture of the commandment of purity. It may appear harmless to many of elastic judgment that a girl permits a young man with whom she may have but a brief and superficial acquaintance to embrace her; yet in no aspect of present-day life does the old adage about the devil asking for a finger and taking the whole hand find more unmistakable application than in the innumerable instances where the refusal to withstand apparently innocent beginnings has ended in heart-breaking complications.

We may grant that the grace of divine guidance can intervene to avert this extreme; yet promiscuous familiarities often assume such overbalanced importance in the association with members of the other sex that they become an all-consuming obsession. There are essential activities in which normal interests should be absorbed - school, work, home, church, reading, recreation. When young people are not occupied with these varied and wholesome enterprises, a dangerous vacuum marks their lives. Young couples who can enjoy themselves only when they are alone and beyond the reach of restraint, who count their good times by the number and variety of their conquests, will learn by bitter experience how empty and disillusioning their misdirected lives are.

The voice of conscience will be heard. For the followers of Jesus Christ this inner monitor cannot be stifled without invoking regrettable results. Many a young man who thought it an accomplishment to oppose this relentless guide has rued his "achievements" when confronted by a clean, God-fearing young woman whose sterling character served only to emphasize his own inconsistencies. Many a girl has learned to lament the heyday of her indiscriminate popularity when, satisfied in her own small mind that she was chasing happiness, she ran on in this huggermugger way to a nightmare in later years.

Here is a letter, typical of many, that I have received showing the deep scar caused by concessions to impurity:

"I am a young man twenty-seven years old. Do you know what it is to be haunted? I can tell you. I have committed some filthy sins, which haunt me so that often I wish to die. Frequently I have an opportunity to tell other younger boys the proper way, but my past actions do not help any. My life has been a very slipshod affair, and as I get older, I suffer for it more and more. What I would like to know is this: Is it still possible for me to marry and be happy after such gross sins? Everywhere I see nice girls with whom I would like to associate, but I feel that I do not deserve them.... I have some fine Christian friends, but my past always looms before me when I am with them. This is a terrible life to lead. I often wonder why God allows a person to fall into such a terrible mess. And often I wonder, too, whether there is a God. I am the president of a young people's organization and a deacon in the church, but I cannot carry out the duties of these offices as I should because of the taunting thoughts that seep into my mind so often. Is there any peace in this world? Is there any hope that I can become useful in this world?"

No previous generation has ever thrown young men and young women together on such an open and wholesome basis as the present, when segregating barriers have been broken down in our young people's societies, in our new ideas of employment and education. With our unparalleled facilities of recreation, both public and private, and with hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually to provide the very best outdoor sport and play for America's youth; enriched by the far-reaching development of young people's work within and without the Church; surrounded by all the character-building programs and the pleasures of music, literature, art, and the higher forms of entertainment, our young men are not asked to lead the secluded life of the monks at Mount Athos nor are our young women directed to isolate themselves behind zenana walls. Our age has been guided by a healthy motivation in providing varied social interests for its young people. Would to God that these admirable arrangements were not neglected for sordid pleasures!

#### "UNCLEAN! UNCLEAN!"

The reluctant discussion on the pages immediately following is offered only because there is a definite need of labeling a sordid complication with a screaming "Unclean, unclean!" We must utterly condemn the moral leprosy fostered by the outspoken approval of apostles of free love, who advocate the unbridled concession to animal desires.

One of the large, widely circulated magazines uses a full-page advertisement to focus the attention of its readers on the question, "How important is virtue among the girls of today?" Beneath this arresting head-line we read that Leila Darrow "has just returned from the country-club dance; she is troubled about her friend Constance, who is recklessly in love. Leila and her mother Helen have a confidential talk.

"'I believe in virtue,' says Helen Darrow. 'I have brought you up to believe in it. I don't understand –"

"'Can't you try to, Mother? Can't you realize that the girl of today does not think virtue so awfully important?'"

Does Leila Darrow represent the average attitude of the American girl today? More specifically, does she speak the language of the girls in the churches of Christ?

A symposium of opinions offered by seventeen newspaper women, representing as many sections of the country, showed a substantial agreement in the charge "that young women no longer cling tenaciously to premarital chastity." For instance, Miss Linda Helfant of the Springfield Republican staff believes: "Virginity used to be a virtue greatly desired and respected. Even the girls who had lost it pretended that it was still their most precious possession and would defend their reputation with their last breath. Fashions in morals change. Nowadays there are plenty of girls who freely admit the lack of it and some extremists who, silly as it may seem, are almost boastful on this point."

Even more sordid are these pessimistic pronouncements of another modern writer: "The young people of today do not believe in the sanctity of marriage any more than they believe in Santa Claus; and there is no use in pretending that they do." He claims that before marriage they have been involved in affairs "with half a dozen or half a hundred other people." "Like it or not," he insists, "these are the facts as I get them from all classes, ranks, and conditions of society." (Arthur Davison Ficke, in Calverton and Schmalhausen, I. c., 660.)

To bolster his revolt against the marriage order, Ben Lindsey drew this disheartening picture: "More than 40 per cent of the boys violate the moral code before they are past school age and at least 75 per cent of our girls do so." (The Companionate Marriage.)

We have all learned to suspect the claims advanced by those who operate with percentages so large that they become almost sweeping generalities. We are entitled to ask how these agitators arrived at such definite percentages when 200,000 clergymen throughout the land can denounce these claims. Mr. Lindsey is not the only youth counselor of the nation; and when one has had the privilege of working with large groups of young people throughout the land, as the writer has, he knows, from personal consultations, from wide contacts, that in church circles the young man or young woman who has had illicit relations belongs to a signifcantly small minority. Far from closing our eyes to the obtrusive evidence of immorality, we must condemn the brandishing of fictitious statistics, the manufacture of tendential evidence. These proportions of impurity may hold for Helga, Phyllis, the irresponsible Henri, the phantom-lover Millie, Hattie, "the home-breaker," and the other psychopathic cases that Lindsey cites anonymously in his book. But bring all the inconsistencies and moral lapses that may find expression in the life of true church-members, and still this total, as lamentable as it is, will be far removed from the impeachment of the Church's youth which brands at least three out of every four of our young women as immoral. It is worth mentioning that Kathleen Norris (Companionate Marriage, p. 4) likewise takes emphatic exception to Lindsey's sweeping claims. She writes: "I have my own channels of communication with America's youth, too. I have hundreds, thousands, of letters yearly from girls of fourteen and sixteen and eighteen. And from them I know that there is honor still among the youngsters in our factories and offices and high schools and that the girl who is too free with the boys, who is 'fast,' who gets into 'trouble,' is the exception still, as she was when I went to school and when my mother and grandmother went to school."

Ill-conceived and unfounded generalities that assail the morals of decent young men and women are often the desperate resort of irresponsible minds. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is preached today with the regenerative impulses that it has always exerted. The Holy Spirit still sanctifies and cleanses the hearts of twice-born children of God.

It is equally evident, however, that American young people have never stood face to face with an alliance of temptations as alluring as the reign of laxity and impurity in the modern decadence. Traffickers in licentiousness are not only accorded repeated opportunities to air their programs for moral chaos, but they are also applauded as they brazenly advocate innovations tantamount to the freest of free love. Youth hears destructionists who prate on the theme "Man is instinctively polygamous" and who would lead gullible disciples to follow these instincts. Youth listens to the twisted, crooked mentality of subversive teachers who insist that repression is unnatural, that biological urges must be obeyed if mental and physical equilibrium is to be preserved — a shallow alibi contradicted by the evidence of the most reputable physicians. Youth overhears the lectures of birth-control exponents, who have advertised their wares with such a despicable lure to lewdness that, according to the admission of radicals, the dissemination of birth-restriction literature has helped to sky-rocket the staggering figures of promiscuity. Youth surveys the whirl of life, and, beholding open immorality, sometimes wonders whether the Church's inhibitions may not be based on a pensioned philosophy.

That doubt expresses itself; and from a mass of similar material I choose lines like these, written me by a Nebraska young woman, a church-member: "In a situation where two normal young people are in love and intend to marry, aren't the marriage vows merely custom? Aren't two young people joined before God even before they speak the vows? ... Oh, I'm not a child; I'm nineteen years old, and that is old enough to know of what I speak!

This suspicion is sometimes supported by the erring counsel of its own elders. The Forum for July, 1936, offers under the title "Twentieth Century, Limited" a paganized exaltation of lust, submitted not by a radical, but by "a modern mother, a West-chester County (New York) matron." In her brazen code of free love this mother deliberately tells her daughter and today's young people that "some experience" in sex is "an essential part" of our "new system of sane sex education"; that unmarried lovers can break down all barriers as long as they have "a strict adherence to some reliable means of control"; that before marriage young people can go the limit in intimacies, provided they show "good taste in choosing their mates and a normal restraint in restricting the number of people with whom they become intimate."

There can be no well-founded doubt that large sections of American society, particularly in circles outside the Church, are described in significant sections of Psychological Factors in Marital Happiness, by Lewis M. Terman. This study, based on findings of a questionnaire answered by 760 husbands and 777 wives, seems to show that premarital chastity has lost much of its significance. The author declares that the majority of men and women born before 1880 were taught to believe that premarriage relations were the most shameful of all sins, especially for the woman. Dr. Terman contend that the swing to the opposite "is proceeding wish extraordinary rapidity." Among the husbands in the group, 50.6 per cent in the oldest section and only 13.6 per cent in the youngest had avoided all premarital experience. The corresponding drop for wives is from 86.5 per cent to 31.7 per cent. Now comes the startling conclusion, "If the drop should continue at the average rate shown for those born since 1890, virginity at marriage will be close to the vanishing-point for males born after 1930 and for females born after 1940." Calmly does the author observe, "It will be of no small interest to see how long the cultural ideal of virgin marriage will survive as a moral code after its observance has passed into history."

#### THE SPOLIATIONS OF LUST

The Church's answer to this philosophy of applauded lust is based on more substantial ground than the mere consensus of civil morality. It impeaches free love, in the first count, on the charge of violating the code of purity established by divine Law. In the guide for human conduct given by God Himself the sins of impurity and fornication are condemned with emphatic severity and ominous repetition. Scripture recognizes no adjustment to the spirit of the times, no arbitration in this discussion of decency, no euphemistic masquerade. Its commands are sharp, final, sweep-ing: "Flee fornication" (1 Cor. 6:18). "Be not deceived; neither fornicators nor idolaters ... shall inherit the kingdom of God" (1 Cor. 6:9, 10). "This is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication" (1 Thess. 4:3). "Neither let us commit fornication" (1 Cor. 10:8). "Fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you" (Eph. 5:3). These and a score of other pointed passages label sex laxity with its right name: it is ugly, damning, soul-destroying. In the very face of those who seek to laugh away these lapses as the sowing of wild oats, the Scriptures with their immaculate standard of purity condemn even fleshly desires and brand lustful acts as heinous sins, for which the retribution of God has commensurate punishment.

As regularly and inexorably as darkness follows the day, the furies of avenging justice will track this sin to its lair. So relentless are God's laws of purity that their violation is often penalized by some of the most appalling punishments known to men. Impurity is frequently productive of unspeakable physical suffering, the cause of devastating social diseases, which rank "with cancer and tuberculosis as a chief cause of illness, death, and economic loss," according to a New York State Department of Health bulletin. If young people who have been surrounded by Christian influences cannot estimate the frightful terror of these repulsive diseases and are inclined to minimize their loathsomeness, let them visualize this picture which paints the repugnant consequences of sexual sin: "To recognize the full character and effect, you would have to compel the world to throw open the doors of all its hospitals and expose to view the moral lepers whose flesh and bones reek with rottenness and death, and as you pass from ward to ward, it would be necessary to require your attendant to call diseases by their real names and tell you the true relation of the many aches and ills to this one terrible disease of diseases which visits its judgments upon the children of its unhappy victims even unto the third and fourth generations; to throw open the doors of the insane asylums to show you the large number of their unhappy victims; to throw open the doors of the sepulcher and show you the bodies of the slain."

While the occurrence of these diseases has been grossly overestimated by propagandists (Margaret Sanger, birth-control advo-cate, claims that in New York City alone four out of five married men and three out of five married women have the most prevalent form of social infection and that 50 per cent of the adult population of the entire nation has similarly suffered, What Every Girl Should Know, p. 71 ff.), it has been shown by Albert G. Love and Charles B. Davenport in their Defects Found in Drafted Men (pp. 73 and 74) that among 2,510,791 men in the selective draft of the United States Army (1917—1918) 89,393, or about three and one third per cent, were victims of three loathsome diseases. If this ratio, established even with inadequate methods of diagnosis, held for the entire population, there may have been about a million and a half men in our country at that time who were similarly afflicted. When the number of infected women is added, it will be evident that impurity provokes the greatest disease epidemic in the country.

Sir William Osler calls one of these insidious maladies "the greatest killing disease among infections." A large life-insurance company describes it as "mankind's most dangerous enemy." A companion disease is called "the great sterilizer," because it is "responsible for many childless homes." Describing the ravages of one of these contagions, medical authorities tell us: "Every bone and tissue of the body is subject to its attack. It causes blindness, deafness, heart disease, and other serious disabilities, including mental disorders and crippled limbs. Especially cruel are its attacks upon unborn children."

Some forms of this contamination are curable; but others lead to idiocy, paralysis, blindness, locomotor ataxia, paresis, the disintegration of internal organs, and finally to horrible death. The Public Health Institute of Illinois, organized by public-spirited citizens as a "not-for-profit" corporation, declares that each year the two most frequent social diseases attack 1,555,000 Americans, 60 per cent more than pneumonia and 14 per cent more than cancer, tuberculosis, typhoid, and heart and kidney diseases combined! Dr. Thomas Parran, United States Surgeon-General, warns that the most frequent of these diseases "infects one adult in ten at some time in life." The United States Public Health Service is authority for the statement that "various conservative estimates attribute from 10 to 20 per cent of organic heart disease in middle age to this cause." Any physician can describe in harrowing details what the sage of the Old Testament means when he warns his son against impurity "lest thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed" (Prov. 5:11).

In a survey conducted for the Missouri Social Hygiene Association by H. C. Loeffler and printed as Costs of Venereal Disease to St. Louis, it was shown that the loss from these diseases consequent to impurity in metropolitan St. Louis ranges between a minimum of $2,071,000 and a maximum of $2,560,000 annually for a year like 1932. The report adds to this: "Many additional venereal-disease costs are not susceptible to financial analysis. During normal periods of business activity general economic loss would loom even larger than the above estimates." If this rate obtains for the rest of the United States, the national cost of venereal disease, as far as this may be computed, would range between $240,000,000 and $300,000,000. Several items in this appalling cost are presented by Dr. Parran, who estimates that every year more than $31,000,000 is spent for those who have become insane in consequence of one of these diseases and that another $10,000,000 is demanded for the care of those who have turned blind. Incomputable is the cost of the 40,000 who die every year from resultant heart conditions, likewise the expense of treating the 160,000 who suffer from heart disease and the half million new cases of this social disease that every year report for treatment. The loss to industry from various venereal diseases has been computed in a pamphlet published by the American Social Hygiene Association, Hidden Costs in Industry (Publication No. 751). Here we read: "A summary of available information indicates that among the general male population between the ages of 15 and 45, the number of days lost from work through venereal disease approximates at least 21,000,000 per annum. At an average rate of $4 per day this amounts to $84,000,000 in wages lost to the men themselves, to say nothing of the cost of employers in compensation, relief, and medical attention plus the difficulties of labor turnover and temporary substitute employees."

"Another example of waste through venereal disease," Hugh S. Cumming, until 1936 Surgeon-General of the U.S. Public Health Service, tells us in the American Social Hygiene Association Publication No. 789, "is the loss due to a shortened life-span. A man who eventually might earn $2,500 a year is estimated at the age of twenty to be potentially worth over $30,000, representing the excess of his earnings above living costs during a normal life time. His death earlier than that means the loss of part of this amount to his dependents."

Terrifying beyond words is this penalty which violated chastity demands; but even more appalling is the price this scourge exacts from the innocent. A clean, healthy girl who marries a tainted young man will probably become infected and may be doomed to sterility, serious operations, chronic invalidism, and broken health. The sex sins of the fathers (or of the mothers) are visited upon the children in no more tragic form than in the hereditary communication of these social maladies. It has been estimated that 80 per cent of the blindness in new-born infants is due to parental sin. Government authorities claim that two thirds of the cases of opthalmia neonatorum (baby's sore eyes) are of venereal origin. The Venereal Disease Manual, published by the United States Public Health Service (pp. 13, 14), tells us that babies born of diseased parents often look old and withered. We read: "A child so afflicted may apparently improve and appear healthy until the age of puberty, when the disease may break out afresh. Then a child of fifteen may have the appearance of a man of thirty, or the reverse may be true — a child of fifteen may resemble in facial expression a child of eight or nine."

"Recent studies in the United States show that an average of one out of every twelve expectant mothers coming to prenatal clinics for advice is infected." The American Social Hygiene Association informs us that this congenital contagion, "passed on to the child from the mother before birth, is the cause of thousands of mis-carriages, still-births, and early deaths. Of the infected infants who are born alive a large proportion die young. Wasted and deformed bodies, skin rashes, ugly sores, bad teeth, blindness, deafness, paralysis, mental defects, and other manifestations similar to those appearing in the adult forms of the disease may be their lot."

The most wide-spread of these venereal diseases has been called the Public Enemy Number 1 of American children, because it touches 60,000 infants every year. It is the largest single cause for still births and one of the major contributing causes to the death of infants in their first weeks. One third of the new-born babies affected in this way will become blind unless they have adequate treatment.

Besides the ravages of these diseases, which can be adequately described only by medical authorities, the sins of impurity are fraught with other serious perils. In spite of all contrary assertions an unwanted child and the curse of illegitimacy are ever present dangers. Society may permit the sinning father to escape without suffering any serious punitive measures, but its double standard will not grant the unmarried mother entrée into its homes. The scarlet letter is still the stigma of an outrage against propriety that even modern liberality has not learned to condone. The unnamed child, handicapped by the heaviest social burden that human selfishness can ever impose, is marked for life. Even a forced marriage, solem-nized in the effort to make the best of a deplorable situation, is often nothing more than a sentence to a lifelong loveless union, cursed by a rage of resentment.

To avoid parenthood, recourse is often taken to the illegal and criminal destruction of life. Writing in the Pictorial Review (January, 1937), Gretta Palmer claims that almost 700,000 babies are annually murdered in the United States through abortion. In these illegal operations more than 8,000 women annually lose their lives. What the others lose in sickness, sometimes in sterility, lifelong invalidism, and insanity cannot be computed. Yet, despite birth-control publicity, this heinous murder increases. The Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor gives a somewhat more conservative estimate but still asserts that in our country one abortion occurs every forty-five seconds. Dr. Frederick J. Taussig of Washington University, St. Louis, Mo., in his technical book on this subject, substantiates the higher figure and estimates that 681,600 abortions are performed annually in the United States, with about 10,000 resultant maternal deaths.

Suppose for a moment that by some miracle of grace all these calamitous consequences are avoided and uncleanness exultingly escapes any tangible requital. Even then lechery reaches out for revenge. Premarital unfaithfulness is often the prelude to post-marital infidelity. The rake who has spent the years of his youth in heedless sin will not be transformed overnight into a paragon of husbandly virtue when restricted by the ties of matrimony. The dissolute girl who marries to reform will find that her capacity for the pure and the beautiful has been destroyed. It is an exacting taskmaster, this scourging vice; and when the thongs of its lash have once become embedded in the flesh of its slave, it is only by superhuman energies that its hold can be broken.

One of the clearest proofs of this truth is experienced by those who transgress God's command. Here is a disheartening confession from my radio mail, which I quote because, far from being an isolated record of these experiences, it exposes a wide-spread danger against which the Church must work and warn:

"I met — at our church; we started 'going steady' and were deeply in love. He showed me a wonderful time. We were planning to be married last fall or this spring. He was a poor church attendant, and I got him to come every Sunday; he joined our societies. He used to tell me over and over again how strong his love was for me and that it would not end until death severed it. I got him so that he did not drink any more or go to dances. I was so proud of him and he of me! He was always showing me off! He told me and his relatives that he had found the one with whom he wanted to spend the rest of his life.... I hardly know how to tell you the next step, which has proved to be my downfall. We broke the Purity Commandment.

"I've asked God for His forgiveness on bended knees, but I've got to get the burden off my conscience. It's driving me mad. I'm getting so nervous and am losing weight. ... People are wondering what's the matter with me, and they ask me if it was a disappointment in love. Am I a condemned person for life? Will I ever be able to marry any one else? Sometimes I walk around in a daze and hardly know what I am doing."

From the South another young woman writes:

"Will you pray for me? I'm so wicked! Do you care to listen? For two years I've lived in sin. I knew all the time I was going wrong; at night I could not pray. It would not have ascended even out of my room. But I am so weak — and I love so desperately! In September I left — for — University here to study. I left home, also my love, but my sin goes with me. It is such a fight, and I cannot feel forgiven! It has gone so far that last night I was going to give up! How can I be among God's elect when I have such doubts? But if you will pray that I may be strong and feel that God has forgiven me, perhaps I can pick up the broken threads and carry on."

Besides the qualms of conscience there often follows the bitter realization that the person with whom the command of purity was broken discards the partner in sin. One of the two letters just cited explains:

"Now he is taking out a night-club girl. She is keeping him out until 4:30 Sunday morning, and then he cannot get up in time for church. It has torn my heart all to pieced!"

And another girl writes:

"Yesterday I received the news that this man, the one I loved, is engaged to my best friend. It is such a blow! I am crushed!"

The deepest woe of this spoliation by lust is the relentless tyranny by which it seeks to keep its victims shackled in sin and separated from God. Impurity, of all vices, is the quickest to choke off spirituality and stifle the voice of conscience. Deprived of the truest and best of this life, its victims will be judged by God in the next. "They which do such things will not inherit the kingdom of heaven" is the formal sentence pronounced by the Word of God (Gal. 5:21). It is repeated in substance not only in Prov. 5:22; Heb. 13:4; Eph. 5:5, where all unclean persons are denied any "inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God," but also in the incisive utterances of Rev. 22:15, on the last page of the Bible, in which carnal-minded "dogs" are doomed to exclusion from the glories of the New Jerusalem and its tree of life.

"Be not deceived, God is not mocked."

#### PREMARRIAGE EXAMINATIONS

Because the ravages of these diseases are so horrifying and entail tremendous losses in money, mind, health, power, and hap-piness, many States have passed premarriage examination laws. Where these regulations are in force, the examination usually follows this course: Within fifteen days of the expected date of marriage the young couple has blood tests made. If the results are negative, the marriage clerk or recorder of deeds grants the license to marry.

It is claimed, perhaps with exaggeration, that this clean bill of health will be given to almost 98 per cent of applicants. The remaining 2 per cent must be treated and cured before the marriage license can be issued. Two per cent seems a negligible number. Yet the suffering and sorrow that can be removed and the check on the spread of this disease through the premarriage tests combine to make us endorse this legislation.

These laws are no complete safeguard, because it has been shown that thousands of couples skip over State borders to other communities in which these laws do not apply. It is also true that they can assure the absence of disease only at the time of marriage. Yet, even with such restrictions these regulations of prenuptial tests will of necessity reduce misery by curbing disease.

Whether or not the legislation of this health test is approved in all States of the Union, we suggest that all prospective husbands and wives make it their personal duty to subject themselves to this examination before marriage. Young people ought to banish all thoughts of embarrassment, rejecting particularly the suspicion that this visit to the physician might be regarded as showing a lack of mutual trust. Some of these diseases can be acquired in an innocent manner, and for a while the victim may not be aware of its presence. Therefore it is simply good common sense and the requirement of our plain duty to take all necessary precautions. Our age has abundant reason for thanking God that through medical advancement within this generation most of these diseases may be cured, if treated early enough and long enough.

#### STRENGTH IN CHASTITY

Defenders of free love have not hesitated to brand the Christian emphasis on premarital chastity as "emotional bondage ad of Morals," in the Forum, July, 1928) pronounces this credo of lust: "Abstinence is nervously and mentally undesirable." A chorus of those who have championed the overthrow of restraint chants the same litany of lust; but it would be hard to find a group of reputable physicians who would subscribe their names to this statement.

On the other hand, qualified investigators unanimously maintain that loyalty to the Biblical standards of chastity before marriage is "not harmful but rather beneficial and that the idea that continence is a cause of nervous diseases is incorrect." The Modern Psychologist (August, 1936) printed a challenging summary of the best medical opinion, as this has been gathered by the careful statistical research of Dr. Jacobsohn, who corresponded with 200 recognized leaders among professors of physiology, hygiene, mental diseases, nervous diseases, and psychiatry. His symposium reveals decisive statements like these: "The conventional view that incontinence in men is a necessary condition of health must be corrected. Instead of the popular fallacy that a young man is physically the worse for a clean, moral life, the entire weight of evidence of the world's foremost medical scholars is unreservedly of the opinion that he is the better for it. It is recognized by the highest authorities that continence is entirely compatible with the most perfect health. Chastity, properly understood, is health: it never does any harm to mind or body."

De. Bruce of the University of Oklahoma, author of Health Science and Health Education, writes: "Abstinence and conformity are detrimental to no man's health."

Some time ago the International Brussels Congress issued a declaration to the effect that "a clean moral life for a man is not prejudicial to the health, but on the contrary is to be recommended from a purely hygienic standpoint. It is the consensus of most of the great medical thinkers." In this opinion it agreed with a similar pronouncement by the medical faculty of Christiania Uni-verity: "The assertion that a chaste life will be prejudicial to health rests, according to our unanimous experience, on no foun-dation. We have no knowledge of any harm resulting from a pure and moral life."

With these decisive verdicts does the best modern medical science endorse the Scriptural blessings of chastity and indict the reign of lust.

### ENGAGED!

What man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her? - Deut. 20:7

"And they agreed to become engaged, at least as long as she stayed at the beach that summer." This conclusion to a Sunday-magazine story typifies one of the deplorable commonplaces of our day, the disregard of the binding power of an engagement promise. Engagements are often made with little or no thought of their meaning and broken at the slightest whim. A young man and a young woman meet, they become infatuated, and after a whirlwind courtship of a week or ten days they are "engaged." Petulant misunderstandings lurk in the offing: a selfish gesture ruffles the placid course of their devotion, and the marriage promise, lightly made, is just as lightly broken.

Too frequently American fiction applauds the girl who proudly displays a list of previous engagements as so many brilliantly acquired trophies. Magazines purporting to embody college humor picture the predicament of the co-ed who finds herself compromised by a half dozen engagements at one time. Drug-store novels glorify the young blades who are ready to enjoy the privileges of the marriage promise without being willing to pledge themselves to a relation which they may hesitate to acknowledge publicly.

Nor are these attitudes simply the notions of immature youth. Dr. Paul Popenoe, director of the Institute of Family Relations, Los Angeles, claims: In "the betrothal period a choice has been made, but it is more or less provisional. If on closer acquaintance the betrothed find that they have made a mistake, it can still be rectified before any permanent commitments have been entered into. From this point of view the social attitude toward betrothal should not be too rigid. When engagement is regarded as equally sacred and binding with marriage, this function is largely lost." (The Journal of Social Hygiene, Vol. XX, No.9, December, 1934.)

Dr. Erdman Harris, associate professor of religious education and psychology at Union Seminary, whom the St. Louis Post-Dispatch describes as "an expert in college circles," asserts that an "engagement should be broken if one or the other discovers some quirk in the other's character, some incident in his or her past, that reveals unexpected and unpleasant habits and attitudes." "Even if the organist is playing the wedding-march when the discovery is made," this university mentor warns, "don't hesitate. Tell him to change the tune. Return the presents."

On the other hand, this attitude, which makes engagement only a temporary promise pledging a more or less exclusive companionship, is opposed by the exaggerated conception which jumps at conclusions and magnifies the simple acts of friendship into the proportions of a formal engagement. Often young people take too much for granted and consider the attentions of a friend equivalent to an engagement, although no definite pledges have been given. Much heartache and rankling disillusionment would be spared if it were generally understood that courtship is not engagement; that not even the expressed wish or hope or expectation of marriage is engagement.

#### BETROTHAL IN THE BIBLE

As we compile the Bible references to betrothal, we find no command requiring betrothal and no specific legislation regulating its formalities. It is accepted as a social institution, and the few passages in which it is mentioned draw a picture of betrothal along lines similar to those with which the wider Semitic archeological developments have familiarized us.

In Old Testament times betrothal was a formal, rigid pro-cedure. The young man, or his parents, paid to the bride's parents a stipulated dower, or bridal price, as compensation for the services which she would no longer render in her home. This legal procedure, usually witnessed and recorded, was often the only formality connected with marriage. Among the Arabs even today betrothal has this distinction, and in the account of Isaac's marriage (Gen. 24:63-67) there seems to have been no additional ceremony.

Parental consent was essential for every betrothal. When Isaac came of age, he did not choose his own wife; his father took the initiative and paved the way for the happy union with Rebekah (Gen. 24:3 ff.). When Jacob fulfilled his contract with Laban and was ready to marry Rachel, he went to her father and said: "Give me my wife" (Gen. 29:21). The Israelite father, according to the Old Testament legislation, could refuse to give his daughter to a suitor and thus prevent marriage (Ex. 22:17; Deut. 7:3; Num. 30:3 ff.). Yet the pledge of betrothal was bestowed of a free will. Parents did not tyrannically impose their own preference upon their children. The example of Rebekah's family in ascertaining her inclinations toward the prospect of marriage with Abraham's son and in asking the question "Wilt thou go with this man?" doubtless shows how most betrothals were introduced.

After the pledge of betrothal the young woman was virtually regarded as a wife. Her husband could claim her immediately or after an interval which ranged from a few days (Gen. 24:55) to a year, according to later custom. But the principle remained: once the betrothal was effected, the husband could take the bride as his and celebrate the nuptials when and how he chose. Betrothal established the marriage relation. An Zacab, calls Rachel his "Wise, ment, Mary is called a wife although it is specifically added that she was a "virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph" (Luke 1:27; Matt. 1:18-20). In addition, there are passages in which engagement is in some respects equated with marriage. Thus Deut. 22:23 shows that the violation of a betrothed virgin is punishable exactly as the same crime when committed against a married woman. And Mielziner (The Jewish Law of Marriage and Divorce, p. 75) concludes: "Betrothal is not a mere promise to marry, but it is the very initiation of marriage." In short, when the Old Testament speaks of betrothal, it pictures a definite, un-qualified, formal act which makes the two young people essentially husband and wife.

#### ENGAGEMENT TODAY

Any one who understands the trends of our times will concede that this conception of espousal is often as far removed from the American mind as the very word "betrothal" is from our popular vocabulary. In our day parents often have very little to say in the matter of engagements. Either parental disinterestedness permits the children to select their life mates, or the young people resent any well-meant advice and feel offended when Father or Mother raise their voices in warning against the person of their choice.

Especially is the Scriptural conception of engagement as a sacred, binding, inviolable promise opposed to the prevalent opinion. Even the Catholic Church teaches: "For good reasons it [an en-gagement] may be honorably rescinded. And one such reason net may be honorably would be if, after being engaged to a man, a girl would become conscious of having the chance to procure a much more desirable and valuable marriage partner than the one to whom she promised her troth." (Youth's Pathfinder, by Rev. Fulgence Meyer, O. F. M., p. 343.) With this ecclesiastical endorsement of an opportunist policy in engagement, we are not surprised to find that for great masses of young people, engagement is nothing more than a conditional agreement that may be kept or broken as the course of expediency seems to dictate.

#### THE CHURCH'S IDEAL

In sharp protest the Church's attitude toward engagement may be summarized in this formal definition: When, with the consent of their parents, a young man and a young woman who can enter a valid marriage voluntarily and unconditionally promise to marry, this pledge constitutes a valid engagement, which must not be broken.

The Church thus insists upon parental blessing. According to the laws of the land young people may shift for themselves after their twenty-first year; but according to the laws of God sons and daughters are solemnly required to honor their parents during their entire lives. Say what we will about parental interference, maternal selfishness, or lack of parental adjustment to modern conditions, the fact remains that Christian young people should consult their parents, respect their wishes, and receive their blessings in questions of courtship and marriage. Usually the experience of a Christian father and the devotion of a Christian mother will qualify them as preeminently trustworthy counselors.

It follows, then, that the Church cannot recognize the so-called secret engagement, made without parental knowledge or against parental will, provided this disapproval has Scriptural base and reason, as has been pointed out. Consequently Christian ministers will not marry young people when the objection of their fathers and mothers cannot be overruled by the Word of God. Very often, however, parents have clearly granted a tacit permission when they have seen their children keep "steady" company and have not raised their voices in protest. This precludes the validity of subsequent parental disapproval.

Only morally shallow young people will enjoy the privileges which they may associate with their private promise of marriage and later, when they experience a change of heart, condone their actions by claiming that, since they had kept their engagement secret, it is without all validity and binding power. A girl who, let us say, for a year or two has permitted a young man to restrict his attentions upon her and who has repeatedly given him good reason to assume that she will marry him, even if there is no formal, legal basis for this assumption, cannot suddenly change her mind and, taking recourse to a technicality, insist that, since her parents have not approved, there can be no valid engagement. She cannot find a formal flaw in the fact that there is no engagement in the technical exactitude of that term. She is bound by her conscience to marry the young man who has been encouraged to interpret her words and actions as consent.

Similarly objectionable are attempts to coerce the free will and decision, like that described in the following press item: "Unless Charles F. Corbin, son of the late Philip Corbin, head of the American Hardware Company, marries or becomes engaged before next Saturday, he will lose a considerable part of his share in the final settlement of his father's estate of more than $5,000,000. In reply to a flood of inquiries he only says: 'I am not married; I do not expect to be married or engaged by Saturday. The financial reward is not sufficient to make me take the risk.'" In the same way marriage promises exacted nder the threat of punishment or pledges elicited in a state of drunkenness are not engagements and have no binding power.

The Church further refuses to recognize as valid engagements those arrangements in which the promise repudiates the very purpose wedding entirely uncertain. Thus, if a young man and young woman promise to marry, but the fiancée insists upon having no children, this is not a binding engagement, for it overrules the ordinances of God. Or if a young man promises to marry when he has saved $5,000 or when he receives a salary of $50 a week, this is a conditional promise, but it is no engagement. His savings may never reach the desired goal, or his salary may be cut, and by the very condition he imposed he could not marry. Engagement is an unqualified pledge. Unfortunately many "engagements" are made with the clear-cut understanding that, if later there is a change of affection, either party is free to make other arrangements. This attitude, as popular and wide-spread as it is, is fundamentally opposed to the Church's conception of engagement. And one of the Church's many educational projects should be directed toward giving its young people sound information on the meaning and binding force of a Christian engagement.

The Church finally insists that engagement is not a temporary. halo of happiness which can be discarded as soon as its luster seems to tarnish. Engagements cannot be broken with impunity. Two young people who are truly affianced in the Scriptural sense have entered a holy relation, which should not be severed even by mutual consent, parental permission, or change of mind. In general, the only reasons recognized by the Church for which a true engagement may be broken are similar to those which annul or disrupt marriage — acts of fraud, of unfaithfulness, or malicious desertion. When engagements are heedlessly fractured, a holy relation has been disfigured by a grievous sin. The consciousness of this fact may be dulled in the laxity of our age and the seriousness of this whimsical breaking of engagements minimized; but a better and happier day would dawn if the full implication of Christian engagements were understood and followed.

#### A PROFOUND LESSON

The period of courtship preceding engagement should therefore be a time of careful and adequate appraisal. Young people who defiantly urge the ever-repeated claim that it is better to break an engagement than to break a marriage or that it is far more practical to discover incompatibility, though engaged, before the wedding than after, are indulging in shallow argumentation. The business world would not countenance for a moment the application of these principles in the conduct of its transactions. If a man contracts to buy a house, he must buy it; if he pledges himself to participate in a project, he must participate or pay damages. Yet, we are told, when a young man in formal engagement promises to marry, he ought to be permitted the privilege of changing his mind if he believes that he has been mistaken in his judgment. Even legal procedures in practically all civilized countries recognize the damage that may accrue from the broken engagement and demand financial compensation for the injured party. A young woman whose fiancé has broken his pledge may sue her former betrothed for damages sustained by the breach of his promise. She may also find cause for action against any intermeddlers. In most cases, never aired before a court, the heartache and the disillusionment are too deep to be computed in dollars.

The best interests of young people demand a period of courtship long enough for both to arrive at certainty regarding the qualifications of their life partner. Only when every vestige of doubt has been removed and both young people are convinced (after an acquaintance long enough to make this conviction intelligent and personal enough to make it complete) that they love each other, - only then, after having committed the whole issue to God in earnest prayer, should the first step toward an engagement be taken.

#### A THRILLING PRELUDE

The discussion up to this point has been somewhat technical; for the general misconception of engagement as the Church understands it necessitates a clear-cut statement of basic facts. However, the happiness of two young people affianced is by no means coldly formal. The months of engagement that separate the fluttering and suspense of courtship from the new responsibilities of married life often form the happiest of life's pleasures. Engagement is a thrilling prelude, vibrant in the joy of love, almost tremulous in the anticipation of unfolding, deepening devotion. When two Christian young people enter a true engagement, they belong to each other, and both God and man are happy with them in this new relation, in the bestowal of their caresses, and in the expression of endearment. The power which has drawn them together and led them to announce their marriage promise is one of the strongest and holiest impulses which the all-wise Creator has planted in the human heart. Love, when sanctified by the Savior's grace, is a purifying and uplifting power, so intense that it far surpasses any other earthly blessings which God has showered upon His children. When, by the provident guidance of Him who brings husband and wife together, two Christian hearts find each other and announce that they are pledged until parted by death, the Church says to them: "Enjoy your love. Enjoy the endearments with which your mutual affection may be expressed. Enjoy everything which your devotion, purified as it is through Christian faith, brings you. But always remember that you are Christ's and that your bodies must be kept as temples of the living God." Let crepe-hanging ascetics brand this newly bestowed love as carnal; let misguided zealots insist that a life without the joy and pledge of a marriage promise is the holier existence; the fact remains that, when two hearts and lives are betrothed in Christian engagement, they have reached the foothills of earth's ecstasy.

Yet engagement does not break down all reserve nor remove the last barriers. By a peculiar argument some newly engaged young people permit themselves to feel that now, being pledged to each other before the world, they can give unlimited evidence of their love. Any voice of protest which an insistent conscience raises is silenced by the appeal that they are virtually married and that therefore it cannot be wrong for an engaged couple to assume the privileges of marriage.

At the 1934 Conference for Marriage and Family Social Relations in Columbia University's Teachers' College, Dr. Robert Laton Dickinson, secretary of the National Committee on Maternal Health, said that he had quizzed fifty couples of high intelligence in 1895 and had learned that one engaged couple in five had assumed marital privileges before marriage. In 1930 he investigated fifty more cases. One pair in three admitted similar intimacy. The questioning was repeated in 1934, when he learned that every other couple had not waited for the ceremony. His findings were confirmed by Lester Winthrop Dearborn, Boston psychologist and president of the Massachusetts Society for Social Hygiene. He asserted on the basis of 200 case investigations in Boston that today half of these engaged couples were as good as married.

We believe that the ratio in church circles must be notably lower; yet pastors tell us that clear, concise expression is necessary to remove any haze of uncertainty in regard to the demands of decency. It must be borne in mind that under all circumstances the wedding ceremony is required for the consummation of marriage privileges. To demand all before marriage is a sinful overstepping of bounds which outrages convention, promotes dishonesty, detracts from the joy of marriage, and helps to create a worried state of uncertainty that can neither be free from remorse nor undisturbed by an accusing conscience. Happy the bridal couple that approaches the altar in the heightened joy of that purity presupposed by the Christian wedding ceremony!

For this reason, among others, the days of engagement should be few. If after a sufficiently long courtship the time of engagement could be reduced to two or three months, much of the misunderstanding and inner pain that sometimes mar the beauty of betrothal would vanish. Engagements that last five or ten years usually are unfortunate. Sometimes the sheer force of circumstances offers no escape from a long engagement. When Matthew Fontaine Murray, the profound meteorologist, later to be acclaimed "the Pathfinder of the Sea," gave his sweetheart, Ann Herndon, a ring engraved with these words of Scripture "The Lord watch between thee and me when we are absent one from the other," he little thought that it would be nine years before the pledge of his engagement could be fulfilled in marriage. Other betrothed have been obliged to wait even longer. While occasionally harsh circumstances may necessitate the unexpected postponement of marriage, normally these prolonged periods of delay are unnecessary and sometimes serve as an unworthy covering for attitudes or actions which should be censured. An analysis of the reasons for postponing marriage after an announcement of the engagement will reveal in most cases an unmistakable element of selfishness. This delay complex is based on either the unwillingness of the future brides and grooms to relinquish their freedom and assume the mutual obligations of marriage; or on the absurd adherence to difficult financial or social goals; or on the selfish intrusion of parental influence; or, perhaps more frequently, on the insistent and pervading uncertainty as to whether marriage is advisable after all, the despicable thought that perhaps a more attractive match may present itself; or on other allied motives which should have been answered and dismissed before the very thought of engagement was contemplated. The aftermath of these almost interminable extensions is frequently seen in a gradual but unmistakable fade-out of love. Much suffering could be avoided if engagements were postponed until the wedding-day can be designated.

#### A TIME OF PREPARATION

The months of engagement are to follow the definite direction of preparation for marriage. With all the ecstasy of this new relation, many practical questions present themselves for answer. During courtship these issues were subordinated, since the future home, the matter of income, furniture, food, were hazy anticipations only incidentally woven into the gossamer of romance. After engagement they materialize into more mundane realities. A thoughtful anticipation of these issues during the betrothal bliss will do much to reduce the perplexing posthoneymoon problems.

With engagement the time has come when the future husband must study the best purchases at the best price. During these weeks the hope chest, that mysterious treasure-trove of feminine delight, is metamorphosed from a catch-all for pin-cushions, finger-tip towels, souvenir spoons, and odd pieces of bric-a-brac into a sternly practical household chest with linens, towels, pillows, and blankets.

It is to be regretted, in passing, that the trousseau of the modern bride often restricts itself to an up-to-date wardrobe. In Grandmother's day the well-equipped bride brought with her at least the standard dozen of all table utensils and linens. Today this premarriage outfit often shares the fate of our securities and drops to six and even to an all-time low of four — new evidence of Lilliputian ideals in our Titan age.

By way of contrast read these items of a dowry which a Puritan father ordered from England for his engaged daughter:

"Curtains and valens for bed with counterpane, head cloth, and tester made of good yellow watered worsted camlet with trimmings well made and bases if it be the fashion. Send also of the same camlet and trimming as may be enough to make cushions for the chamber chairs.

"A good, fine large chintz quilt well made.

"A true looking-glass of black walnut frame of the newest fashion if the fashion be good, as good as can be bought for five or six pounds.

"A second looking-glass as good as can be bought for four or five pounds, same kind of frame.

"A Duzen of good Black Walnut Chairs fine Cane with a Couch.

"A Duzen of cane chairs of different figures and a great chair for a chamber; all black walnut.

"One bell-metal skillet of two quarts, one ditto one quart.

"One good large warming pan bottom and cover fit for an iron handle.

"Four pairs of strong iron dogs with brass heads about five or six shillings a pair.

"A brass hearth for a chamber with Dogs Shovel Tongs & Fender of the newest Fashion (the Fire is to ly upon iron).

"A strong Brass Mortar that will hold about a Quart with a Pestle.

"Two pair of large Brass sliding Candlesticks about five shillings.

"Two pair of large Brass Candlesticks no sliding, of the newest Fashion, about five or six shillings a pair.

"Four Brass Snuffers with stands.

"Six small strong Brass Chafing dishes about four shillings apiece.

"One Brass basting Ladle; one large Brass Ladle.

"One pair of Chamber Bellows with Brass Noses.

"One small hair broom suitable to the Bellows.

"One Duzen of large hard-metal Pewter Plates new Fashion, weighing about 14 pounds.

"One Duzen hard-metal Pewter Porringers.

"Four Duzen, of Small glass Salt Cellars of White glass; Smooth not wrought, and without a foot.

"A Duzen of good Ivory-hafted Knives and Forks."

We may profitably consider the contrasted ideals and policies of two types of young people, the drones and the workers of the human hive. Here is the couple that regards the period of engagement as high-flying months of expensive pleasure. They frequent the fashionable restaurants, pay prohibitive prices for entertainment, and, systematically developing expensive tastes, cultivate a mode of living far beyond their possibility of maintenance when the honeymoon is over. After the wedding ceremony they enter their life's companionship quite unprepared for its sterner realities. They purchase costly furniture at exorbitant prices and involve themselves in the meshes of instalment payments. Not infrequently both become dissatisfied with the step-down that marriage has brought in the simpler standard of living.

Another couple, however, places a rational maximum on its expenditures, devotes evenings to the planning for the future home, its furnishings and decorations, and is seriously concerned about the long range of domestic arts, from the practical requirements of cooking to the more artistic harmonies of color schemes. They are ready to start in a small way, by systematic savings and cautious expenditures to secure their own home and make it an attractive and restful dwelling.

No lengthy argument is required to show which of these two couples has proceeded along the happier course. A word of warning against the high cost of wooing may be necessary. Refreshing to a high degree is this brief paragraph by Cornelia Stratton Parker in her prize-winning American Idyll, the life of her husband, Carleton H. Parker (p. 18): "No one, no one on this earth, ever had the fun out of their engaged days that we did when we were together. Carl used to say that the accumulated expenses of courting me for almost four years came to $10.25. He just guessed at $10.25, though any cheap figure would have done. We just did not care about doing things that happened to cost money."

Altogether, then, engagement is as serious and prayer-provoking as it is vibrant with anticipation of the future and exultant in its present joy. Engaged couples should not permit themselves to lose. sight of the fact that, while their affianced state is really a preface to their book of marriage, the very foreword of this book of varied and vital contents must strike a sober, thoughtful key-note and be penned in the happy and reverent terms of Christian consecration.

#### AT THE ALTAR OF THE LORD

Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. - Col. 3:17

About one million marriages are annually solemnized in the United States, As these lines are read, then, in thousands of homes prospective brides and grooms are engrossed in planning the details of their wedding. Invitation lists are being prepared, wedding-dresses fitted, trousseaus completed, menus inspected, forists' estimates compared, photographers consulted, bridesmaids instructed, honeymoons scheduled, and the many other details. of a modern marriage are successively arranged.

This prenuptial excitement, it often seems, devotes serious concern to every phase of the wedding except to the point of paramount issue, the ceremony itself. Scrutinizing care seeks to avoid any social faux pas that might mar the bridal conventions; yet the more vital questions as to where the marriage is to be solemnized, who is to officiate, and what pledges are required by the ritual are often lightly dismissed.

If a statistical sleuth could catalog the places where young people are united in marriage today, he would disclose a notable decline in the number of church-weddings and a startling increase not only in civil ceremonies but also in sensation-seeking stunts.

#### VULGAR EXHIBITIONISM

The extremes to which irreverent "stunt" marriages have resorted is bewildering. Marriage vows were spoken in the air almost as soon as the Wright Brothers left the ground at Kitty Hawk; but it remained for a New York couple to substitute a parachute drop for a wedding-march. Jumping out of a Sikorsky cabin plane, 2,100 feet above Roosevelt Field, Long Island, after saying, "I do," to the tune of two 525-horse-power Hornet motors, the bride and the groom leaped into near tragedy. Spectators Looked up horror stricken as the capricious parachute of the bride of the ground.

Los Angeles witnessed a submarine wedding "solemnized" by the pastor of a local Universalist church. Seattle saw aquaplane nuptials, with bride, groom, and preacher towed through the harbor at sixty miles an hour; Brooklyn beheld a baseball-park wedding, a pastor of the Reformed Episcopal Church officiating. Lansing, Michigan, was entertained by a noisy carnival and a double wedding staged by the Knights of Columbus. Hoboken was startled by lion-cage rites, in which a New Jersey Baptist preacher united a circus lion-tamer with his quivering bride. Blasé Broadway gaped while a pastor of a New York Reformed Church read the marriage ritual in Cell No. 13 of an old convict ship anchored at the Battery. In short, it would not be easy to find a place too high or low, too dry or wet, too hot or cold, to be the locale of a wedding ceremony.

Common sense denounces this unholy masquerade and deep resentment is aroused when the sacred act is made a public spectacle, a publicity-craving farce, a snubbing insult to God. No wonder the newspapers bring head-lines like this: "Couple who was Wedded on Stage Spent Their Honeymoon in Jail." No wonder that the gifts showered upon a young couple married in a Chamber of Commerce ceremony in Ironton, Missouri, included free attorney's services for divorce! Marriages with vulgarly spectacular beginnings usually have fiasco endings. The most astounding angle of this uncouth exploitation is the ease with which some clergymen lend their name to such farces. As long as men called to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ engage in the antics of circus clowns, the Elmer Gantry type of novel will continue to feature the parasite preacher.

Europeans seem to show a more respectful attitude; for when a double wedding was performed in an airplane cruising over Berlin, the clergyman who read the ceremony in an altar-equipped plane was suspended from his pastorate. America can learn also from Australia. As soon as it was reported that a marriage ceremony would be performed on a mystery hike, the commissioner of the Victorian Railways refused to permit the train to start. His decision was supported by a commendatory editorial in the Melbourne Herald, concluding with this indictment of sensation-mongering clerics: "Clergymen who have been able to reconcile the freak weddings to their sacred office have pleaded the omnipresence [of God]. Logic would hardly be strained much further were "holy matrimony' entered upon before the grinning clown in a circus ring or amidst the guffahs of folly. at a performance of vaudeville."

#### AMERICAN GRETNA GREENS

Much more frequent than these grotesque bids for notoriety are the clandestine ceremonies performed by a justice of the peace in some modern Gretna Green. This Dumfriesshire village on the border of England and Scotland, notorious until the middle of the last century, was popular with elopers, who could be married by the blacksmith, the ferryman, the toll-keeper, or by almost any citizen after they had crossed the Scotch border. In fact, Scotch law permitted marriage before witnesses without the service of an ordained clergyman. While the British law, under Lord Brougham's Act of 1856, altered this traffic in hasty marriages by demanding at least three weeks' residence in Scotland, the famous marrying place still retains its attraction. A local blacksmith, former Methodist preacher, married 1,700 couples over the anvil in six years; and in order to modernize this profitable business, local interests submitted the plans for a Gretna Green Aerodrome to the British Air Ministry. Its popularity recalls the Little Brown Church in the wildwood of Iowa where the pastor performed more than 2,000 wedding ceremonies in five years.

We have our own marriage centers that have capitalized the original Gretna Green idea. An investigation by the Russell Sage Foundation, covering a study of marriage-law practices in thirty States, disclosed the existence of fifty-seven "marriage-market towns" in twenty-nine States. In these places, runners are employed who, on account of competition, solicit business even by boarding automobiles in motion when they believe the occupants to be matrimonial candidates. Two justices in another marriage center advertised in street-cars: "Sweetheart, be ready at four o'clock. We'll go to —, just a short ride, and Justices - and - will tie the knot." Similar signs, displayed in other centers, extend such invitations as: "Let me hitch you up." "My couples stay married." "A marriage performed by Judge — lasts a lifetime."

William T. Martin, in the New York Times of October 4, 1935, gives this account of a marriage mill near Pittsburgh: "The 1930 census gave — a population of 6,398. Around the first of September this year's marriages in the town had been run up to more than 4,000, with four months to go. Last year the total of marriages in — was 4,397 and for the year before, 3,914.

"Not all the ministers of the town of course are parts of the mill. Some of them vigorously condemn the traffic in marriage, confining their own performance of such ceremonies largely to members of their own congregations. Five of them, however, are frankly commercial. One of these last year married 1,225 couples, and this year another performed 1,044 marriages in the first eight months. In the 'mill,' of course, are 'guides,' or favored taxi drivers. Fees of the minister range from $2 to $20; for the 'guides,' from $2 to $5. At certain stores near the court-house, wedding-rings may be obtained for from 10 cents to $10. While the license fee is $2, the office also sells marriage certificates running up to $5, according to binding."

Social workers in the Russell Sage study report one marriage mart in which the justice of the peace sets his regular fee for marriage at $3; but if the principals are eager to have their wedding glossed over without any newspaper publicity, this extra service raises the charge to $6. A grasping jeweler in another town had himself appointed notary and then advertised marriages without charge for all who purchased their rings at his place. Other justices of the peace supplied bridal veils, wedding-rings, even hats and coats — upon the payment of stated rental fees.

An eighty-five-year-old justice of the peace displayed this sign in his office window: "Marriages today only $1." When this cut rate failed to bring more business, he added this postscript: "A pound of breakfast coffee, tea, or cocoa to every couple."

The greed of some marrying justices may be seen from reports covering an unidentified marriage market. "There is a telephone girl so placed that she sees people when they pass through the corridor and into the license issuer's office. If she believes that they are seeking a marriage license, she telephones to a justice whose office is across the street. He then comes over and stays in the corridor until the pair who have just received a license appear. Of all the marriage fees procured in this way the telephone girl receives a share. Formerly justices in the town came into the license office itself and almost fought there over their quarry, but later these troublesome officials were denied admittance. The justice across the street was violently opposed, when interviewed, to any change whatever in the marriage laws. It was much better, he thought, to let people marry and then get divorced if things did not 'turn out all right.'" (Richmond and Hall, Marriage and the State, p. 222.)

#### THE MARRYING PARSONS

Particularly obnoxious is "the marrying parson," the clergyman with no church who lives by commercializing the wedding ceremony. It is true that "only a small minority among ministers of religion can be charged with commercialism, while many of the justices have allowed their eagerness for marriage fees, however earned, to become notorious." Yet these few, forgetting the spiritual requirements of their office, helped to bring unwarranted criticism on the clergy in general. The tactics of marrying parsons are described in these excerpts from Richmond and Hall's studies:

"A former marriage-license clerk on the Pacific Coast describes his plan of helping retired and needy clergymen by sending license-holders to them for the marriage ceremony. One minister so favored was able at the end of four years to purchase a small ranch with his fees. The other clergymen had offered to share with this clerk all fees received from candidates sent by him.

"Under another former license official in a large city of the Middle West a certain clergyman was allowed to perform ceremonies in the license office and had a desk there where he sold unofficial marriage certificates suitable for framing.

"An officiant who formerly had been a circuit preacher established himself regularly in an unoccupied space at the court-house of his home town in Iowa. His procedures led to a protest on the part of the local ministerial association, and the court-house authorities ordered him out. Later he engaged quarters in a building directly opposite, where he tried to arrange with some of the other tenants to let him call upon them to act as needed witnesses at marriage ceremonies.

"A minister, after his retirement from active service, bought a house directly opposite one of the marriage-license offices in a Northwestern State and decorated this home with three signs. Two were hung at opposite ends of his front porch; the third was on a post in the center of his lawn. He complained to us that too many other ministers had now moved into the same neighborhood in order to avail themselves of the opportunity to perform marriage ceremonies.

"In a Pacific Coast city one of the retired clergymen used to advertise in the telephone-book that he would celebrate secret mar-riages. He also displayed a sign on his house, 'Marriages, $2.00.' A wedding-march was played so continuously upon his phonograph that the judge in the neighboring court-house entered a complaint.

"An evangelist in a Southern city was interviewed as he loitered about the court-house. If the people coming there looked at all like applicants for marriage licenses, he accosted them, explained that he was a minister and would be glad to serve them. He spoke to us with indignation of one man who, after promising to come back to him for the ceremony, had applied to a Catholic priest instead. One candidate from the country had said that he preferred to have a justice of the peace officiate because a gold seal would be affixed to his marriage certificate by the justice; but this minister assured him that he was willing and able to do as much and more." (L.c., pp. 282, 283.)

To counteract this attitude, many clergymen refuse to solemnize marriages if the two principals are unknown to them or do not come recommended. This policy precludes any charges of commercialism and helps prevent many domestic tragedies.

#### A CHRISTIAN CEREMONY FOR CHRISTIANS

When young couples can secure marriage licenses and be united in matrimony by civil authorities in one tenth the time required to obtain an automobile license, the Church must reempha-size that, since marriage is not only a civil function but also a sacred institution ordained by God Himself, Christians should be married in a Christian ceremony.

Out in Girard, Kansas, Mr. Haldeman-Julius, publisher of successive infidel sheets, broke into print by having the marriage ceremony repeated before a civil authority ten years after his wedding. This man, who specializes in blasphemies, claims: "Marriage is a man-made institution, regulated by law. I have always regarded the fact that we were married by a preacher as a blot on our lives, and for the satisfaction of our intellectual integrity Marcet and I have agreed to go through the ceremony before a judge." But his civil ceremony was less binding than the church service; for not long after the judge had performed the second ceremony, the Haldeman-Juliuses were separated by a divorce decree.

The hazard to happiness often involved in weddings without the religious element is demonstrated in an interesting survey conducted by the editor of the Lutheran. Concluding that the civil marriage and the clandestine ceremony often lead to unhappiness, he summarizes: "The great bulk of the unhappy partners in wedlock either never went to a clergyman, or else they were strangers to the minister who married them. There is a great deal of significance in the fact that four fifths of these wrecks of hope for happiness are unknown to clergymen."

A pastor of The Little Church Around the Corner in New York, who because of the popularity of that marriage Mecca has had abundant opportunity to watch the wedding parade, is quoted as declaring that nine out of ten of the couples which eloped or rushed headlong into marriage lived unhappily. Young people who deliberately run away to get married by a justice of the peace or by some grasping preacher are not only guilty of breaking the commandment enjoining filial devotion, they have also cast aspersion on their Church and altogether have laid as firm a foundation for their future happiness as the Empire State Building would have in the Everglade swamps.

A word of friendly advice may be timely in urging our young people to be married by their own pastor. An official of our Church writes in a private communication: "In ever greater numbers our members, either with or without the knowledge and approval of their parents, go away from home to be married, in some cases by Lutheran pastors of our own Synod or by some Lutheran clergyman outside our Synodical Conference. I know that, if figures were available, we should be shocked at the revelation. Again and again this matter is discussed in our conferences. Even though in private conversation we instruct and admonish our young people, it seems that this condition becomes more general from year to year."

#### IN CHURCH OR IN THE PARSONAGE?

A Methodist pastor recently stated: "Very few Methodist weddings are performed in the church. Of every one hundred weddings probably seventy-five are performed in the parsonage, ten in the church, and fifteen in other places." While this proportion of one church wedding out of ten is doubtless exceeded in other denominations, the parsonage has received uncontested preference. There the couple stands in the pastor's study or the sitting-room while the brief rites are performed and pleasantries exchanged in the few moments before the newly-weds leave. It is possible of course to solemnize Christian marriage anywhere — in the Sahara Desert, on the plateaus of Tibet, or on the coral reefs of a South Sea island. The marriage vows are always binding, no matter where spoken. Under ordinary circumstances, however, it is desirable that the Christian wedding be celebrated before the altar. The church is the house of the Lord. Here little children are received into the baptismal covenant; here Christian youth kneels to pledge itself for time and eternity to the service of Christ; here we pay the last tributes of lingering love to the memory of departed kin and friends; here in the mystic Sacrament human souls are strengthened by the very body and blood of their Redeemer. In what better place, we ask, should a man and a maid be joined in holy matrimony if not in their spiritual home? We heartily agree with the following extract from a letter of the Bishop of Montreal to his clergy: "I would therefore like to see all services of the church take place in the Father's house. Every baptism, wedding, and funeral should be in the church. The divine law of love will inspire each priest to deal with exceptional cases as they arise. These should not alter the application of the principle. I would ask you to urge upon your people the desirability of having all services in the church. It is more seemly, more reverent, more dignified, and shows more honor to God and to those for whom the services are held."

The reverential love of a church wedding is quite impossible in many of the hasty ceremonies outside the sanctuary. Even the worldly wisdom of a writer in Harper's Bazaar makes the pointed inference: "People who go through church ceremonies with a minister know they are married. It isn't like dropping in and having the knot tied by a justice of the peace, so that the partners of the pact have a hard time remembering the circumstances later. The affair gets so hazy that a careless young couple fails to recall whether they went before the justice that time to be espoused or to be fined for passing a red traffic light. Anyway, they conclude, it was one mistake or the other. So, let the wedding-bells ring out."

A church wedding in itself need cost not a penny more than any other ceremony. No throng of guests need be invited; formal dress is not required; lavish floral display and decoration may be missing; the strains of a high-priced orchestra are unessential. A young couple can reverently kneel before the altar and invoke the Savior's presence without incurring expenditures that may impair their finances. If congregations have the policy of charging our young people for the use of the church-building on such occasions, let them remember the decreasing number of church marriages in their circles!

More important than the scene of the wedding is the marriage service itself. When Christian young people are married, they should have at least a brief sermon or address, even if circumstances make it necessary or advisable to have the rites performed at home. The very importance of the occasion should suggest at least a few words of Scripture, a short address by the pastor, and a prayer for God's guidance. When the ceremony is in church and guests are invited, congregational singing and prayer should find a suitable place. How utterly unexplainable the attitude of many bridal couples whose wedding festivals last half the night with plenty of time for merrymaking, but who are too hurried to have a full marriage service with sermon, hymns, and prayers!

How God may use even the marriage service in the miracle of His conversion is shown in the remarkable story of Henry von Rohr, whose entire life was changed at the marriage altar. As a young man, brought up under the Prussian court influence and educated at military academies, he had lived without Christ. But, as his grandson writes (Walther League Messenger, May, 1939, page 598), "during the marriage service came his conversion to Christianity and the unquenchable thirst for religious truth. The sermon that day as well as subsequent sermons ... caused this worldly-minded young man to take an active interest in Lutheran theology. When his wife died with the birth of their first child, his adversities only strengthened his desires for a religious life." Years later he became an outstanding figure in the pioneer history of American Lutheranism.

#### AN INTELLIGENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARRIAGE VOWS

Churches could render an important service to their young people if they would submit to all prospective couples a small, plainly written folder containing the exact meaning and requirements of the marriage ritual. It is not enough that a self-conscious bridegroom or a trembling bride knows when to say, "I do," or is able to repeat the marriage vows. It is not nearly sufficient that the steps from the church-door to the altar have been measured, the intervals of the procession gaged, and the entire wedding-march smoothly synchronized; the very center and climax of the whole service is the exchange of promises and pledges before God.

In the flutter of excitement many diversions may distract attention from the solemn words spoken by the officiating clergyman. The letter in which William Cullen Bryant broke the news of his wedding to his mother records, not without a grain of cynicism, the. thoughts of a disconcerted bridegroom.

"I hasten to send you the melancholy intelligence of what has lately happened to me.

"Early on the evening of the eleventh day of the present month I was at a neighboring house in this village. Several people of both sexes were assembled in one of the apartments, and three or four others, with myself, were in another. At last came in a little elderly gentleman, pale, thin, with a solemn countenance, pleuritic voice, hooked nose, and hollow eyes. It was not long before we were summoned to attend in the apartment where he and the rest of the company were gathered. We went in and took our seats; the little elderly gentleman with the hooked nose prayed, and we all stood up. When he had finished, most of us sat down. The gentleman with the hooked nose then muttered certain cabalistical expressions, which I was too much frightened to remember; but I recollect that at the conclusion I was given to understand that I was married to a young lady of the name of Frances Fairchild, whom I perceived standing by my side, and I hope in the course of a few months to have the pleasure of introducing to you as your daughter-in-law, which is a matter of some interest to the poor girl, who has neither father nor mother in the world."

We take deliberate time in signing agreements that concern real estate, property, or financial obligations. In the most intimate earthly relationship, should we not have a full understanding of its obligations and privileges as well as of the effectual help which God promises? In what more practical way can the Church supplement its pastors' sermons on these subjects than by plain, printed outlines explaining in detail the meaning of the wedding ritua!?

#### THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY

The form which the wedding ceremony assumes varies in different churches. In Lutheran circles and in many Protestant churches the ceremony begins with some introductory remarks by the pastor, in which "those who purpose to enter the holy estate of matrimony" are asked "to hear what the Word of God teacheth concerning it." After appropriate Scripture-passages follows the pointed question to the groom in these words:

"Wilt thou have —, here present, to be thy wedded wife?

Wilt thou love, honor, and cherish her and keep with her this bond of wedlock holy and unbroken till death you do part? If so, declare it before God and these witnesses by saying, 'I will.'"

After the groom has answered, "I will," the bride is asked:

"Wilt thou have —, here present, to be thy wedded husband? Wilt thou love, honor, cherish, and obey him and keep with him this bond of wedlock holy and unbroken till death you do part? If so, declare it before God and these witnesses by saying, 'I will.'"

After the bride has answered, the wedding-ring may be placed on her finger. Many prefer the double-ring service. Then both are directed to join their hands. In the longer service the groom repeats after the minister:

"I, —, in the presence of God and this assembly, take thee, –, to be my wedded wife and plight thee my troth in every duty, not to part from thee till death us do part."

Likewise the bride pledges:

"I, —, in the presence of God and this assembly, take thee, , to be my wedded husband and plight thee my troth in every duty, not to part from thee till death us do part."

After these pledges in the longer service or after the bestowal of rings, the pastor declares:

"What God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. forasmuch as — and — have consented together in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before God and this assembly, I pronounce them husband and wife in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."

The bridal couple then kneels, the pastor asks God's blessing upon the new husband and wife, lays his hands on their heads, speaks the Lord's Prayer, and concludes with the benediction.

It is a simple ceremony, but because of its lifelong importance it should be carefully studied in advance of the wedding-day, so that with calmness and conviction the young people can intelligently and reverently pledge themselves to the obligation of this promise.

#### HERE COMES THE PRIDE!

A church wedding may lose in solemnity by overemphasis on externals. Dr. Caleb R. Stetson, rector of Trinity Church (Episcopal) in New York City, the wealthiest parish in the United States, speaks frankly on the exploitation of church ceremonies: "What are called 'fashionable' weddings are often vulgar displays of wealth. The church is so decorated with palms and trees and Powers that it resembles a flower show more than a church, and it is made difficult to realize that it is the house of God or that a religious service is taking place there."

Perhaps it was revolt against such showy marriages that prompted a young lady to write: "Why do pastors advise church weddings when they are often merely fashion parades instead of solemn and blessed occasions? Should not God's house be a place of worship and not a salon in which the latest styles can be dis-played? Many bridal parties concentrate more on their appearance than on the minister's message and the marriage ritual. They find it hard to keep their minds on what the minister is saying and instead ask themselves, I wonder what the people think about the flowers. I wonder how I looked when I came in. I hope the flower-girls do not make a mess of things,' etc. I am sure that these are among the many thoughts of the bride; for those who have gone through the ceremony tell me that they were so nervous at their weddings that they were unaware of anything the pastor said or did. Then, why have elaborate church weddings? They are indeed a mockery; they employ God's house in vain.

It is unfair to generalize on the basis of extremes and abuses. Yet it frequently happens, even in Christian circles, that the fashion-show appeal predominates and weddings degenerate into competitive expenditures of money, with one bridal couple trying to outdo the other. To judge by extravagance and exhibition a more appropriate wedding-march would sometimes be "Here Comes the Pride." An endless, snail-like wedding procession, with an overdressed male contingency, but with bride and bridesmaids parading in the opposite state, — these are hardly the appropriate preparations for marriage. After all, the girl who is not thinking exclusively of her face and appearance, but who asks God to keep her faithful will make the better wife, the truer companion, the more loving mother, just as nobler husbandly impulses may beat beneath blue serge that under formal evening dress.

This is not a veiled attack on the propriety of attractive church weddings. We are out of sympathy with a professional counselor in the affairs of the heart who chides a young bride because "it is always the girl who wants the big church wedding with white satin and orange blossoms and a long veil and bridesmaids." Christian young women are entitled to as impressive a weading as their means will permit, as long as the solemnity of the occasion is not destroyed by externals. It is the day in a girl's life in which she should appear amid the most pleasing surroundings. Let cynical scoffers read the Forty-fifth Psalm, in which the beauty of an attractive wedding procession is described as a symbol and prophecy of the mystical union between Christ and His bride, the Church.

A wedding that does not degenerate into a display of clothing and extravagance, but that is concluded with a full consciousness of its sacred import will be the gateway, under divine blessing, to lifelong happiness. The song of a wedded life is usually sung to the melody intoned on she wedding-day. Christ-centered weddings lead to Christ-endowed homes.

## TWIN MENACES TO WEDDED HAPPINESS

### THE BLIGHT OF BIRTH CONTROL

Be fruitful and multiply - Gen. 1:28

Unnmistable trends toward the diminutive mark this colossal age of Empire State Buildings, Boulder Dams, and public-relief billions. A generation or two ago, in the overworked yesteryear, a more complacent public pondered over three-volume novels in quarto. It listened patiently to sermons that were half over when, like Stevenson's voluble cleric, the preacher might say, "And now, thirteenthly, my brethren." Then men of parts smoked long stogies as they ruminated on two-column editorials. It was a large world, and it took things in a large way. Today the novel has tapered down to the novelette, and this, too cumbersome, has given way to the short short story. Churches feature sermonets. The typical citizen lights a cigaret and, reading as he rushes from a kitchenette breakfast, he skims over an editorialette. with reading-time reduced to fifty seconds.

#### SHRINKING FAMILIES

The most telltale evidence of the fact that in this age of Titan ambitions moderns are conceiving of life in the miniature is the diminutive family. Two investigators at the University of Wisconsin, Baber and Ross, have shown in their studies, The Changes in the Size of American Families in One Generation (p. 26), that, "whereas the fertile families of a generation ago averaged 5.44 children each, the corresponding average for the present generation is but 3.35 a family, a decrease of nearly 40 per cent in a single generation. When allowance has been made for the childless families, the absolute rate of decrease is such that the second generation after the present one will produce families with an average of 1.05 children, or one third of the minimum necessary for the continuance of the race."

Well-nigh universal is this decline in birth-rate. In Great Britain a new low percentage was reached in the first quarter of 1932, when the number of births per 1,000 decreased to 15.3. things continue as at present for a sufficient length of time," a British sociologist warns, "our population will die out. The process will be slow, but there would be a considerable decrease before A. D. 2000.". Despite these warnings only 610,850 children were born in England and Wales in 1937, reaching an all-time minimum of 14.8 per thousand population.

The Registrar-General of Scotland reluctantly recorded that 1931 saw the lowest birth-rate in that country, with 19 births per 1,000 population; but 1937 brought a further decrease to 17.9.

In France, where in 1929 the number of deaths exceeded the births, there was a decrease from 21.4 in 1920 to 18.1 in 1930 and to 17 in 1936.

Conversely, Manila's Bureau of Health reports for the year 1931 a new high of 56.65 births per 1,000 population. Among the world's large cities Madras comes next with 40.5. If we contrast with this the ominous fact that in 1931 the Berlin ratio was the lowest in the large cities, dwindling to 8.7 per 1,000, we see that heterogeneous Manila reproduced itself seven times as fast as Nordic Berlin. Nor is the Berlin figure isolated in vital statistics; for in 1931 the ten largest German cities, a statistical bulletin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company informs us, showed a birth decline of more than 10 per cent over 1930. Since the advent of the Hitler régime, however, with its official protest against childlessness and its financial aid for parents, many sections of the Third Reich have been strengthened by an increasing birth-rate. The German rate dropped from 29 per 1,000 population in 1911 to 17.5 in 1930, while in 1937 the figure rose to 18.8. On May 5, 1939, Nazi officials declared that during 1938, while the marriage rate had increased only from 9.1 per 1,000 to 9.4, the birth rate had risen from 18.8 to 19.7 per 1,000.

In our own country the 1917 birth-rate was 24.7 per thousand. Ten years later, in 1927, this figure dropped to 20.6; and after another decade, in 1937, the American birth-rate figure was 17. A graphical summary of the decrease in our American birth-rate presents these figures: In 1850, exclusive of slaves, the average size of the American family was 5.66; in 1860, similarly excluding slaves, it was 5.3; in 1870 it dropped to 5.1; in 1890 it declined to 4.9; in 1900 to 4.7; in 1920 to 4.3; and in 1930 it reached the lowest level of all times, 3.4. Fewer children were born in the United States during 1933 than in any year since the start of the twentieth century.

A cross-section of our metropolitan life shows that every one of the fourteen largest American cities experienced a decided drop in the birth-rate. During 1931 there was, for example, a decrease of 22 per cent in Boston, of 17 per cent in Detroit, and of 6 per cent in Pittsburgh. The 1933 birth-rate for Massachusetts was 14.7, the lowest figure since the complete records were started in 1841.

The slump in the American birth-rate may also be illustrated by the United States Census Bureau's analysis of the 1932 vital statistics of New York State. This showed that of all large cities of the Empire State only Utica recorded an increase in birth-rate for 1932. The percentage for New York City declined from 16.2 per 1,000 to 15.3.

The shrinkage in American families may be graphically visualized in a statement issued on October 4, 1935, by the United States Census Bureau. Startling is the statistical fact that one out of every three married couples in the United States is childless. This figure refers only to "normal" families. If families broken by divorce or death are included, the percentage of childlessness is still more alarming. In 1930, within the normal group, there were 23,352,990 couples, of which 7,447,328 were childless; 5,254,863 families had one child; 4,246,459 had two children; 2,650,730, three children; 3,753,610, four or more.

Many and contradictory attempts have been made to explain these drastic declines, but no reasonable doubt remains that the most pronounced factor in the diminution of our American families is the employment of artificial means to restrict the size of the family, - birth control, as the term is commonly understood.

This is not a pleasant subject for investigation and discussion, but it is one of the most vital issues in our modern life; and its consequences directly involve individual and national welfare. To decline the discussion of its admittedly wide prevalence is merely to adopt the alleged head-hiding gesture of the ostrich. To hesitate in formulating a clear-cut statement of the entire issue because of the intimacy of the relevant facts or because the presentation may suggest procedures which might otherwise be unknown, is simply to minimize the wide-spread sophistication of youth and to close one's eyes upon entering a drug store; for in thousands of communities throughout our country information on birth restriction is so obtrusively advertised that those who have eyes to see cannot escape it.

We will not be expected to describe or define the scope and means of birth control; besides, there are only few phases of modern marriage in which there has been such a wide-spread understanding. In a questionnaire sent out by the Rockefeller Bureau of Social Hygiene it was shown that of 992 married women who answered certain questions, 897 expressed knowledge of birth-control methods. Prof. E. R. Groves, in Marriage, shows (p. 360) that of a class of 46 college seniors only 10 gained their knowledge of birth-control methods while at college. With the exception of two students, who answered evasively, all the rest, two thirds of the class, acquired this information during the high-school years or, in three instances, while at grammar school.

In addition, the specific methods of birth control are suggested by courses given in some of our American colleges. The Conference on Education for Marriage and Family Social Relations that reports in the Journal of Social Hygiene, January, 1936, p. 29, protests: "It is rather surprising to find 15 of 105 courses in some of the 225 American colleges that offer instruction on marriage and family life giving an hour to 'technique of birth control, a topic which is illegal in many States and generally is regarded as suitable only for medical schools."

What, then, are the reasons advanced for the endorsement of birth control and for the elimination of the Federal statutes which heretofore have made the spreading of birth-restriction information illegal?

#### THE OVERPOPULATION BUGABOO

The first line of attack usually starts with the assertion that, without placing some restriction on the normal propagation of the human race, the world will soon be overpopulated.

Actually this claim plays little part in birth control. Entirely different motives are decisive. Edwin Grant Conklin of Princeton, in his Heredity and Environment (p. 320), admits: "No one denies that the chief motive for limiting the size of families is personal comfort and pleasure rather than the welfare of the race." A volume of President Hoover's Committee on Social Trends, issued May 14, 1933, recognizes that birth control is a factor in accelerating the marriages of young people. They are more willing to marry now, the report concludes, than they were when they were "reasonably certain that they would have children born at rather regular and frequent intervals."

The overpopulation bugaboo has been urged for generations, but especially since the days of Thomas R. Malthus, an English clergyman, who lived a hundred years ago. Having surveyed the toil and turmoil of human existence, he wrote his Essay on the Principles of Population, claiming that, since the world's population appeared to be increasing more rapidly than the available food supply, some decisive check upon the human growth was necessary. In 1798 he prophesied that by 1898 England and Wales would be overcrowded by 112,000,000 people. The actual figure fell short of his estimate by a mere 80,000,000!

In spite of Father Coughlin's unguarded assertion to the contrary, Malthus never advocated birth control; but its champions have seized upon his doctrine to demonstrate the necessity of their hypotheses. Fifty years ago Darwin showed that in some regions civilized man had increased by 100 per cent in two and a half decades, and he asserted that at this rate within a few centuries the human race would so multiply that on the whole surface of the globe four men would be crowding each other on every square yard of dry land. Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, with rare powers of prophecy and against every scientific survey, predicts that the present world's population will be doubled every sixty years or less. He summarizes: "There is only one solution - the scientific control of the birth-rate." Dean Inge, "gloomy" exponent of a similar pessimism, asserts: "There is no doubt that there is a limit to the number of people that can be supported in the world; for if the birth-rate had no restrictions upon it in any part of the world, that limit would be reached in less than a century." Prof. Edward M. East. biologist of Harvard University, warns that the day of reckoning is not far distant and that some of our grandchildren will live to see this age of overcrowding.

The extremes to which Neo-Malthusianism leads may be illustrated by the overproduction specter of Henry Pratt Fairchild in the New Republic (October 16, 1929): "If the population of the earth were to continue to increase at the rate that prevailed during the period 1906 to 1911, at the end of 10,000 years there would be, allowing one and one half square feet of standing-room per person, 60,570,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times more people than there was room for. Of course, this is an impossibility. Something must and will intervene to forestall it. The whole question is, what?"

Fairchild's answer is: "Birth control." Our answer is: "God." While a mechanistic philosophy may compute formidable tables of population increase and brandish them before gullible minds, the student of history as well as the simplest child of God knows that divine Providence cannot be eliminated. As St. Paul told the philosophers of Athens, God in heaven "hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation" (Acts 17:26).

Oysters know nothing of artificial birth control; and within five generations the unrestricted offspring of a single prolific blue-point, if packed ever so closely together, would pile up a bulk eight times as large as the entire globe. Biologists tell us that a normal oyster in the course of its existence produces 16,000,000 young. If these, in turn, could reproduce to the same astonishing degree, before many decades had passed, the solar system would be disrupted. But bivalve as well as human reproduction and survival is more than a simple matter of geometric growth.

The actual crisis in America is not that of an alarming human expansion but the prospects of a startling decrease. Louis I. Dublin and Alfred Lotka, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company statisticians, have predicted a stationary population of about 150,000,000 by 1960-1970. Others have posited a maximum population of about 140,000,000 by 1945, to be followed by a few decades of fixed population and then by a decrease. E. O. Baker, census expert of the United States Department of Agriculture, says: "The number of births today is sufficient only to maintain a stationary population of about 140,000,000, having the present average age of fifty-nine at death. Although this average age of death may increase slightly, it appears unlikely that the United States will ever have more than 160,000,000 people unless the number of births or of immigration increases."

President Hoover's Research Committee on Social Trends substantiates these results in a most remarkable way. In the Review of Findings (1933, p. xx) we meet these indicative statements: "Manufacturers who try to estimate future markets have been expecting a population of 140,000,000 by 1940; but the calculations of our contributors, based on information not presented in the decennial censuses, show that the declining rate of increase has been particularly striking since 1923 and that hardly more than 132 or 133 millions are to be expected by 1940. As our statisticians look further into the future, they see possibilities of still greater declines in growth, with the probability of a stationary population. They show that we shall probably attain a population between 145,000,000 and 190,000,000 during the present century, with the probability that the actual population will be nearer the lower figure than the higher. Such a prospect is radically different from that predicted a generation or even a decade ago." (Our italics.)

A similar change of prediction is conceded by Dr. Warren S. Thompson and Dr. P. K. Whelpton, investigators of the Scripps Foundation for Research in Population Problems, of Miami University, Oxford, Ohio. Writing in the New York Times, March 18, 1934, they declare: "It is now abundantly clear that most of the estimates of our future population made prior to about five years ago are going to prove considerably too high." They admit that the birth-rate drop has been more rapid "than was anticipated, even by the initiated." "All indications," they warn, "point to the approaching end of population growth during the current phase of our national life." Their investigations show the probability of a stationary population within two or three decades "at somewhere between 135,000,000 and 145,000,000."

Nor is the Neo-Malthusian worry regarding an inadequate food supply justified. The United States Department of Agriculture states that in 1938 only 350,000,000 acres were devoted to the production of food (for home consumption and support), and that 670,000,000 acres remained for utilization. Carrying this to the efficient extreme accepted by the Japanese, who are able to maintain one person on the products of an acre, it may be said that a total population of 1,020,000,000 could be supported by the arable acreage of the United States at the present rate of agricultural yield.

There is no reason to suppose that this rate of production is stable and must be restricted to a present minimum. When economists place the saturation point of the United States population at about 300,000,000, we may well remind ourselves that our natural resources are so bountiful that it is not reasonable to define any upper limit of productivity. Ways and means of increasing food harvests which our forebears could not anticipate have been given to us through steam, electricity, machinery, and the prodigious research of soil and crop experts. Advanced farming and selective breeding have recorded astounding conquests.

The late William D. Showalter, Sc. D., editor of the National Geographic Magazine, draws a drastic picture of contrasts to show that "what was once the most powerful scientific argument for birth control has been made invalid by economic facts." He writes: "It has been my privilege to see the original potato plant that grew in the highlands of Peru. The smallest tuber that ever flourished in a down-East truck garden is a prize-winner, both in quality and quantity, beside the original potato of the Andes region. Likewise it has been my privilege to see the original corn of the Andean highlands. The meanest nubbin that ever grew in an Iowa corn row would command the blue ribbon beside it. A few years ago I had occasion to attend some of the commissary accounts of Washington's army. The heaviest steer I could find as having been delivered weighed 450 pounds. Last year, in rambling about Southern Maryland, I found traces of a historic colonial cow, the record-holding bovine of her day. Her owner decided to rechristen her when she broke the Southern Maryland record, so as to perpetuate her wonderful flow of milk at each milking. And so she was called Five Pints."

On February 12, 1936, Carnation Ormsby Butter King was crowned champion of the bovine world. In contrast to Five Pints this cow averaged 105 pounds of milk daily for 380 days. She weighs 1,704 pounds and is the first cow to give over 38,000 pounds of milk per year. As recently as 1897 the champion cow in point of butter production was Belle Sarcastic, with an annual yield of 902.10 pounds. Now, through scientific breeding, a strain of Holsteins has been perfected that in the record-breaking development of Carnation Ormsby Butter King reached an annual production of 1,752.5 pounds, an increase of almost 100 per cent in thirty-nine years. While the average cow in the United States today gives about 6,000 pounds of milk in a year, there is no reason why the average production should not reach 10,000 pounds. A professional breeder of Holstein Fresians in the State of Washington writes: "The principles of breeding and feeding which are being developed by progressive breeders and which have resulted in the enormous increase which we witness today in milk production have not readily been adopted by the average dairyman."

Authorities in New York City tell us that sales of certified milk fell from 40,000 quarts in 1931 to 25,000 in 1935. In this connection Dr. John L. Rice, New York Health Commissioner, told a New York audience of scientists and milk company executives: "You can, of course, blame part of your trouble on the advocates of birth control, because the very marked decline in the birth-rate, from about thirty-five per 1,000 at the beginning of the century to thirteen per 1,000 now, cannot have failed to lessen the demand for a milk used almost entirely for infant-feeding. Even as late as 1915 there were over 140,000 births in this city; now, with a population 50 per cent larger, the number of births is only 100,000 per year."

The studies of Prof. Alonzo Taylor of the Food Research Institute of Leland Stanford University and Prof. Don D. Lescohier of the University of Wisconsin have shown that by growing alfalfa in the semiarid grazing plains, seven steers have been fattened where only one barely existed before; that the average litter of hogs, now 3.5 animals, should be systematically increased to 4 or 5, this alone offering 64 pounds of meat per person per year for the maximum estimated population of 1980.

With four European countries, taken collectively, yielding in seven important crops about 41 per cent more bushels an acre than the average of out country; with the possibility of tropical agriculture in the offing, of which Dr. Bailey K. Ashford, hook-worm-eradicator in Puerto Rico, says: "When we eliminate illiteracy, malaria, yellow fever, hookworm, and similar conditions from the life of tropical populations, we may set loose possibilities of agricultural output beyond our present expectation"; with the production of synthetic food making rapid and surprising advances, we need not fear that the coming generations need hover uncertainly on the verge of starvation.

Fifteen years ago F. G. Tryon and Lyda Mann conducted an inquiry into the natural resources of the nation and reported that "our petroleum reserves are now being exploited at a rate which cannot possibly be maintained for twenty years, from all that we know now." With half of their period of respite passed, the utter fallacy of their prediction is shown by the semistagnation into which the oil industry has dropped, with gasoline in lavish superabundance.

It is ironical that birth control should receive its strongest endorsement at a time when surplus crops have helped to arrest our national prosperity and to precipitate a financial crisis. The world's markets have been glutted with grains, vegetables, fruits, and foods. The Federal Government bought millions of bushels of surplus wheat; oranges by the ton rotted on the ground; hundreds of thousands of apples were thrown into the Columbia River; wide fields of berries were left unpicked; car-loads of Alaska salmon were dumped into the Pacific; pigs were slaughtered for fertilizer. While birth-control agitators chant the dirge of imminent starvation, the cornucopia of productivity overflows.

#### PREVENTION OF INFANT MORTALITY

A second claim in behalf of birth control insists that it operates for the advancement of childhood, particularly now by preventing a high rate of infant mortality. Mrs. Margaret Sanger, one of eleven children of a militant atheist, birth-control leader and recipient of Town Hall Club Medal, in My Fight for Birth Control presents her picture of these underprivileged, rickety, tubercular children: "As I stood at the window and looked out, the miseries and problems of that sleeping city arose before me in a clear vision like a panorama: crowded homes, too many children, babies dying in infancy, baby nurseries, children neglected and hungry, children working in cellars, children aged six and seven pushed into the labor market to earn a living, another baby on the way, still another, yet another, a baby born dead - great relief, an older child dies — sorrow, but nevertheless relief — insurance helps, a mother's death."

Less dramatic are the results of the studies made by Dr. Alice Hamilton (assistant professor of industrial medicine at Harvard University) among 1,600 foreign-born families in Chicago. Comparing the families of eight children and over with the families of four children and under, Dr. Hamilton found that the former averaged 267 deaths to every thousand births as against 118 in the smaller families.

Henry Pratt Fairchild, sociologist of New York University, summarizes this claim (I.c.) in the dictum: "Birth control avoids the frightful toll of mortality, particularly of infants, that is inevitably consequent upon an unrestricted birth."

Like other claims for birth control, this contention first exaggerates and then makes the numerous family responsible for a condition in which the number of children may play no part. Dr. Arnold H. Kegel, former commissioner of health for the city of Chicago, does not agree with Dr. Hamilton's figures. He shows that the children in the small families of the Gold Coast of that city are less likely to reach the age of one year than the children born in the Ghetto, the thickly settled twenty-fourth ward with its large families. There the population is 62,000 persons to one square mile; yet the death-rate of infants is lower than on the Gold Coast, with a population of 52,242 persons to an area of 1.64 miles. Dr. Helen Gamgee made a study of 500 very poor families in Holland and learned that the health of the children was better in the families with five children and more, than in those having less than five.

Besides, this objection originates in a wrong point of view. Not all children who die in early infancy lose their lives because of an alleged inherited weakness found in overburdened mothers. Other important factors are the unfortunate influences of infant environment. Birth-control enthusiasts could offer a truly constructive help to the sound development of the race if, instead of trying to restrict the number of children, they would dedicate their organized efforts to the relief of the distressing conditions provoked by the greedy grasp of human avarice. Worthy of practical endorsement is an editorial conclusion in the Medical Times and Long Island Medical Journal: "Far better than birth control would be such a reordering of our economic life as to make it possible for people to have more children and rear them in keeping with their normal and proper needs."

#### RETARDATION OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT

Even if the children in these large families survive infancy, we are further warned, they are under other handicaps. Social studies in tenement homes are cited to show that in the small families of four or less the children were allowed their freedom after school, while in large families, averaging seven children, the latter were obliged to sew on coats or make artificial flowers.

The impression rules in some circles that homes in which reduced circumstances or even poverty prevails cannot be morally good or "civilized" homes. A remark which may be classified by history in the same category as Marie Antoinette's "If they have no bread, let them eat cake!" is J.P. Morgan's assertion during the prematurely killed 1936 Senate Munitions Committee's Investigation. After telling Senator Bone of Washington that in the World War "we saved our souls and saved civilization," the American banker, who helped to finance the hostilities, declared: "If you destroy the leisure class, you destroy civilization." Inquiring reporters later bombarded Mr. Morgan for a definition of "leisure class." Never hesitant in his answer, the tycoon declared: All who "can afford to hire a maid." He estimated that there were "perhaps 30,000,000 families" in this class and explained: "Well, I think that if the housemother has to do all the cooking and all the washing and bring up a family, she doesn't have much time to be civilized and educate her children."

Mr. Morgan's "30,000,000" was wrong, and statisticians soon pointed out definitely that there were fewer than 2,000,000 housemaids in America. Even more glaring was the insistence of the financier that a mother who tends to all the duties of her household can hardly be civilized and take a practical interest in the education of her children. As a matter of historical fact it was the hard-working, middle-class mother without help of a servant who gave our country leaders in almost every walk of life. The passions of discontented multitudes can be aroused no more easily than by such stupid utterances. People are entitled to demand: If, in one short statement like this, a man can contradict all history (which shows that the leisure class has often contributed to the decay of the nations, while the hard-working, honest, frugal, middle-class homes, sans hired maid, have always been the moral backbone of their age), his judgment and conclusions on other matters may also well be subjected to serious question.

Carried through to their logical inference, these misguided proposals would ultimately restrict parenthood to the wealthy and prohibit those unable to support children from reproducing. This spirit of discrimination, besides being basically absurd, is un-American and unchristian. If the poor had been denied the right to have families, most of the niches in our Hall of Fame would be empty. There would have been no Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Mary Lyons, Henry Clay, James Garfield, not to mention a host of other illustrious leaders who have found that poverty and everything it involves — cramped living quarters, lack of educational facilities, early years of toil — have not diminished the opportunities for success.

Of late the charge is repeatedly raised that the families on relief are unusually prolific and that in the interests of public economy and their own welfare the size of these families should be restricted. Dr. S. A. Stouffer, professor of social statistics at the University of Chicago, speaking before a meeting of the Five-State Regional Conference on Birth Control in St. Louis on December 2, 1935, openly expressed doubt that government aid has increased the birth-rate. He asserted that no conclusive figures had been presented to indicate that the type of families on relief "would have had fewer babies under other conditions." (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, December 3, 1935.)

Turning to the slogan "Fewer children and better children," it can be demonstrated that the morality and the achievement of children do not decline with the growth of the family. Large families sometimes become social liabilities, it is true; but so have families with no children or just one child.

In an illuminating contribution published in the Proceedings of the National Conference in Social Work, Boston, 1930, Joanna C. Colcord writes on "Strength of Family Life" in a way which offers little comfort to birth controllers. She shows that homes with larger families seem to have more stable children than those in which the lone child is spoiled by maternal indulgence. Similarly, in families where the battle of life is real and earnest, where constant frugality is demanded in the distribution of the family income, there seems to be a rugged independence for which wealth can offer no compensation. Here the children are often reared on principles of discipline and training which few much more fortunately situated homes can attain.

In Can Delinquency be Measured? (Columbia University Press, 1936) Dr. Sophia M. Robison explodes the myth that poverty is an index to delinquency. This social authority concludes that severe want is not a decisive factor in youthful crime. The figures contained in this report show that for the year 1930 as many children from families with incomes of $50 a week or more were registered for probation as from homes with incomes of $25 a week or less. Well does Dr. Robison ask: "If poverty were the decisive factor in causing delinquent behavior, as it is sometimes claimed, what factor would account for the large number of children reared in poverty who are not known as delinquents? And how might one explain the misdeeds which the rest of us, reared in middle-class and well-to-do families, would acknowledge now that we know the danger of punishment is past?"

Dr. Ellsworth Huntington, research associate at Yale Univer-sity, writing in the Yale Scientific Magazine, throws a bombshell into the birth-control camp by declaring: "The popular notion that children are benefited when families are limited to two is completely wrong so far as Yale College graduates are concerned. The bigger the family, the more likely a boy is to succeed in college." He then offers this thought-provoking compilation: "A study of 1,700 men who were graduated from Yale College in the classes of 1922 to 1926 answers this question: How about the children? Are they not much better off in small families than in large? The standing of these men in activities of all kinds during their college careers was compared with the number of their brothers and sisters. In order to obtain a homogeneous group from nearly the same level, those whose fathers were college graduates were treated separately.

"Here are the astonishing results: The classroom work for the entire four years of college shows a well-nigh perfect gradation from relatively low marks on an average among those who were the only children of their parents up to a fairly high average among those coming from families of six or more. In non-athletic activities outside the classroom the case is similar, although not quite so clear. The students from families with five, six, or more children decidedly excel those from the smaller families in literary, dramatic, religious, and musical activities, in managing athletic teams, in student government, and the like. In athletics there is a most extraordinary regularity in the way in which those from the larger families take a greater part and are more likely to be leaders than are those from the smaller families."

Dr. Barton C. Hirst spoke at the 1933 meeting of the American Medical Association and admitted that it is doubtful whether "the pampered child and a half of the American family is better than the child of a former generation with eight or nine brothers and sisters."

Among eighty of the most eminent men that the human race has produced in the last century and a half, four — Thackeray, Hamil-ton, Ruskin, and R. L. Stevenson — were the only sons of their parents, while many of the other seventy-six were members of large families. Enrico Caruso and Guimar Novaes each had eighteen brothers and sisters; Benjamin Franklin, sixteen; John Marshall, fourteen; Peter the Great and Franz Schubert, thirteen; Napoleon, twelve; Samuel Adams, Walter Scott, and James Fenimore Cooper, eleven; Lord Nelson and Irving, ten; Webster and Carlyle, nine; Grover Cleveland, eight; Jefferson and Dickens, seven; Clay, Longfellow, Bryant, Wagner, and Mozart, six. The debt which the world owes to the mothers of these generously proportioned families is an obligation which birth-control advocates should recognize instead of hurling the darts of sarcasm against the courageous, self-denying women who gladly met the high requirements of motherhood.

If children in large families are not always granted full opportunities of life, the source of this discrimination is not to be sought in the size of the family but in man's social inhumanity and grasping greed. Modern social legislation should enact provisions to make the birth and rearing of children less expensive. Income-tax exemption for offspring should be increased; pay-rolls should be readjusted and sealed for married and unmarried workers. As in Germany, Federal aid should be extended in graduated scale to indigent families blessed with children. Why, then, should birth-control agitators not join the forces that are trying to rescue underprivileged families from the clutches of unsympathetic surround-ings? Why not support the Church, the one agency that has consistently championed the cause of children from the very days when its divine Founder caressed the infants and uttered His immortal "Suffer the little children to come unto Me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God" (Mark 10:14)? Social projects for the help of America's neglected childhood will produce much more lasting improvement than the sum total of all birth-control agitation.

#### ELIMINATION OF UNFIT

A related claim insists that birth control is a powerful purifying agency towards eliminating the mentally, morally, and physically unfit. This widely advocated position is stated by Norman Haire, limitation leader and president of the International Birth Control Congress, London, 1922. He maintains: "The poor are kept in utter ignorance [of birth-control methods]. This should not be, because it gives rise to the breedings of an enormous number of mentally and physically defective beings, for whom the wealthier classes are obliged to contribute for maintenance. With the proper dissemination of birth-control information and instruction, there would be less feeble-mindedness and deformity."

Dr. Eric M. Matsner, medical director of the American Birth Control League, told the 1934 National Conference on Social Work in Kansas City that "75 per cent of the social ills about which the conference is meeting could be eliminated by intelligent practice of birth control." (New York Herald-Tribune, May 23, 1934.) But it has remained for Albert Wiggam (Sorry, but You're Wrong about It, p. 204) to soar to these dizzy heights in his advocacy of this error: "The alluring hope of race improvement through birth control lies in this: such students as Frederick Adams Woods, Ellsworth Huntington, Leon Whitney, and John Phillips have already developed abundant evidence to give us a secure conviction that voluntary birth control leads the able, unselfish, long-lived, intelligent, moral, and socially-minded members of the community to produce the larger families, while those less energetic and less endowed with gifts of nature reduce the number of their offspring. If this be true, then birth control is the most powerful moral agent of which the human race has ever become possessed. It will surpass in potency all the preachments of philosophers and theologians and all the efforts of the inspired writers and educators."

Every intelligent observer should concede that degenerate, mentally defective men and women, of whom medical science can definitely state that their offspring will be similarly deficient, should not be permitted to propagate. However, the application of this axiomatic principle may entail several almost inextricable difficulties. Where shall the line of elimination be drawn? Hereditary and eugenic research has shown the futility of absolute rules. Julian Huxley's unqualified ukase "The deformed should be prevented from having children" is characterized by the weakness of all generalizations. Eugenics knows many deformities not communicable by heredity. Even if these border-line parents could be definitely warned that their progeny would be defective, birth control would still be dangerous, because its methods often fail.

A primary observation suggests itself: undesirable parents ordinarily cannot be coerced into using birth-control methods. With this, the value of mechanical regulation as a process for race purification is drastically restricted.

The medical fraternity recognizes the futility of the exaggerated claims for childlessness as a population-purifier. Dr. Edward N. Ewer, former president of the California Medical Asso-ciation, ridiculed "clinics or other birth-control ballyhoo" as social panaceas and in his presidential address (April 28, 1926) told the California physicians: "Birth-controllers hold out birth restrictions as the remedy for crime, ignorance, poverty, underfeeding, bad housing, tuberculosis, degeneracy, alcoholism, and mental defectiveness. Crime in every form has greatly increased in spite of our falling birth-rate. The extravagant claims made for birth control by its votaries stamp it as the most pretentious as well as the most bizarre of the servist cults."

Even more recently, at the 1938 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Richmond, Virginia, Dr. Clyde E. Kerr of the Howe Laboratory of the Harvard Medical School "discounted birth control as a feasible answer to the insanity problem." He stated: "Contraception as yet has produced exactly the reverse of the differential birth-rates desired because contraception methods as practiced by morons fail, whereas they are quite effectively carried out by college graduates."

#### MATERNAL RELIEF

Birth control, its devotees continue, offers mothers a new sense of freedom and an opportunity for self-expression which is quite impossible with a large family. Here we have the glitter and glamor of this delusion, the throbbing push behind the entire movement. The overworked picture of garrets crowded by broods of children and mildewed cellars housing impoverished families is often only of secondary concern. The chief difficulty is this, that many regard the coming of a child as a social and economic calamity, an unwelcome infringement upon the activities of husband and wife.

Birth control generally offers American women freedom of activity and expression. On the other hand, it is equally evident that this freedom entails a tremendous loss and robs womanhood of one of its greatest blessings. Emancipated champions of women's rights may sneer and challenge: "Why should a mother enslave herself through the care of her children?" The mother who answered the question, "What Price Baby-tending?" in the North American Review, July, 1930, gives a long and significant list of blessings that come with maternity. She enumerates: 1) "an incentive with greater driving power than any she has ever known"; 2) "the abiding sense that one is engaged in creative work"; 3) "the sense of being linked to the future"; 4) "self-discipline"; 5) "an emotional uprush quite as tremendous as first love."

The Scriptures call children "an heritage of the Lord" (Ps. 127:3), and for every normal woman the highest glory and sublimest distinction lie not in the repudiation of this heritage but in motherhood. The emptiness in the lives of childless wives and the grimness of disillusionment which often settles on their faces are telltale evidence of the prohibitive price paid for wilful exemption from a blessed privilege.

When a mother has six or eight children and these little ones are born too closely together, we are assured, the physical constitution will of necessity be impaired, since childbirth takes its toll in maternal health. This claim is based upon the assumption that the Christian Church and the opponents of birth control uniformly and unqualifiedly demand large families and insist that the children come in rapid succession. The Church has always refused to legislate in these matters and issue manifestoes on the minimum number of offspring. No intelligent opponent of limitation ever taught that the family must grow even if the mother's health collapses.

Most wives, however, are strong and healthy, and the birth of children, instead of producing a constitutional collapse, will bring a normal, healthful strengthening. The devoted wife of Nathaniel Hawthorne was an invalid, with a youth of pain behind her. In her protracted illness she wrote: "All my life long my word has been, 'This is well, and tomorrow it will be better; and God knows when to bring that tomorrow?" Her better tomorrow came through her marriage with Hawthorne. Seven times she was close to death, but seven times she survived. She gave the world three children and herself health, this high-souled woman, who declared: "Home, I think, is the great arena for woman; and there, I am sure, she can wield the power which no king or conqueror can cope with." Her experience has been amply illustrated by careful research into the status of mothers with large families. Dr. A. W. Ausems made an investigation of maternal health in 165 families that had averaged nine children each. Of these mothers 108 averaged 64.5 years at death, and 57 were still alive at the age of 64.3. There have been other studies by eminent physicians (Moore, The Case against Birth Control, p. 165 ff.) which show that despite the dangers of childbirth, mothers in these investigation groups who had six to eight children are more healthy than those who had only half as many or less.

#### MISCELLANEOUS BIRTH-CONTROL ARGUMENTS

Birth control is also endorsed as a moral necessity. Its advocates allege that it counteracts the prenatal murder of children. Prof. Henry Pratt Fairchild (L.c.) declares: "It avoids the incredible pain and degradation of abortion, which remains such a blot upon our most advanced civilization that the only way, we can tolerate it is conventionally to shut our eyes to it."

We should never obviate one difficulty by introducing another. Christian ethics do not permit the selection of the lesser of two evils but demand the rejection of all that is morally reprehensible. Despite the far-flung dissemination of birth-control material, there has been no decrease in murders by abortion. The conclusion is obvious. In addition, the number of illegitimate births in the United States is steadily increasing. With the wide spread of contraceptive information, immorality and illegitimacy have both increased.

"Large families are an important cause of child labor"; so writes Guy Irving Burch in the New York Herald-Tribune of May 12, 1929. Before codes prohibiting child labor were intro-duced, Owen B. Lovejoy, former general secretary of the National Child Labor Committee, estimated that with family limitation in the poorer classes perhaps one third of all the working children in this country could be saved from drudgery. But in the exploitation of child labor the children in small families work as well as those in large families. The battle must be directed against twentieth-century murder of innocents, perpetuated in spite of all legal restriction. The elimination of child labor in recent legislation robs the contraceptive theory of one of its stock arguments.

Mrs. Margaret Sanger finds the absence of birth control a reason for the depression and suggests a two-year moratorium on babies, declaring: "Every child that is now born will only add to the financial distress of the family." However, any policy of halting a normal healthy growth in population is financially disastrous. Birth control, subversive at all times, is particularly insidious in days of financial retardation.

The 1936 convention of the American Medical Association heard its committee report that it found "no evidence available to justify the broad claim that dissemination of contraceptive information will improve the economic status of the lower-income groups."

Professor Fairchild advocates a moratorium on babies for a hundred years. He told luncheon guests at a Foreign Policy Association meeting in New York City on February 15, 1936, that the increase of population has been one of the major war causes, since crowded nations are forced to find additional territory for their enlarging numbers. Illogically he asserts: "Vigorous nations will fight when they find that the pressure of their growing population threatens the standard of living and raises the menace of hunger and starvation. A century of stationary population the world over would do more for the cause of international peace than all the treaties and pacts that could ever be signed, and the means of this objective is the wide dissemination and full accessibility of scientific birth-control facilities."

More recently the editor of The Woman's Home Companion (October, 1938) resurrected this overpopulation specter. He claims that for many decades experts have been convinced that "the human race is multiplying too fast for its own good." Germany's reaching out for new land; Italy's conquest of Ethiopia; Japan's annexation of China; India's famine, plague, and poverty; the anti-immigra-tion laws, — "all these are testimonies to the need of birth control." But, the editor continues, this is a problem for our country, too. Thirty-three per cent of our next generation, he holds, is born of the one sixth that is supported by relief. With cold judgment he asserts that "for many it would be better if they had not been born." And the conclusion is pointed: "Just as it is the physician's duty not only to cure but also to prevent disease, so also it is his right and duty to prevent birth where birth would be harmful. Ask your physician!" (His italics.)

This is cruel and illogical reasoning. Wars were waged during centuries of sparse population. With the world large enough for many more hundreds of millions and fertile enough to produce food and sustenance for additional billions, scientists should not advocate recourse to morally objectionable principles, but should champion more strenuously international cooperation and reapportionment of colonial territories.

Thus the arguments of the birth-control advocates, professional and amateur, follow in long array. As they are now surveyed in rapid summary, their weaknesses may be classified. First of all, they exaggerate, and their claims, set forth as uncontested truth, will not bear the light of unbiased investigation. Then, they make the large family a responsible factor for conditions of which it is fundamentally innocent. Finally, these arguments for artificial birth control disregard both the statements of Scripture and the results of contradicting sociological research.

#### THE PHYSICAL PENALTY

While none of these alleged advantages for children, parents, and society have any foundation in fact, its claims are emphatically contradicted on decisive and far-reaching counts. First of all, it is physically injurious. When motherhood is deliberately avoided, we may have an explanation for many physical failings as well as for the constitutional weakening of many women. This verdict of Dr. Frederick McCann, surgeon at the Samaritan Hospital for Women in London and recognized gynecologist, declares with sweeping finality: The injurious effects of these contraceptive methods are at last appearing in medical literature... All known methods of contraception are harmful to the female; they only differ in being more or less so." (National Life, March, 1931.)

Sir Robert Armstrong Jones, British specialist, warns: "Birth control leads to lunacy in women. If you are to have birth control on a large scale, you will have to add to your lunatic asylums for mothers. The absence of children leads to neurasthenia in married women, and that leads to insanity. I know from my own practice that it is a fact."

Tinged with sarcasm but coolly logical are the words of Dr. Edward K. Niles, in the Chicago Tribune of March 21, 1931: "As a man and as a physician I resented the following statement of the ministers of twenty-eight Protestant assemblies concerning the use of contraceptives, viz.: 'It is essential to consult the family physician. Not all physicians are willing to teach their parishioners how to do a detestable thing. Let the clergy who admit expert knowledge in distinguishing the true and false in contraceptives give the instructions and not wish it on the doctors! Family physicians, as a rule, have a conscience; so let the burden of spreading these scandals of unnatural acts rest on the heads of those who advocate this offensive form of immorality. Since the end justifies the means, what next? The same sophistical argument justifies criminal abortion and infanticide. Will we not, under the guidance of the clergy, soon reach that high level of Platonism where the family physician, having delivered the child, will be called upon to strangle it in order that the first-born may have a modern college education?"

Absolute and final is the verdict of Dr. Joseph Collins of New York (The Outlook, December 21, 1927): "A lifelong contact with individuals afflicted with nervous and mental disorders should make me a more competent witness than a lay woman. No one can practice any form of birth control systematically and continuously without being injured spiritually and few without being injured bodily."

Clothed in similar terms was the warning of Dr. Joseph J. Mundell, professor of obstetrics at Georgetown University, expressed before a Congressional committee. (Hearing H.R. 5978, January 19, 1934.)

More specific is the suggestion that a new disease of the skull, a cranial bone thickening, may be associated with birth limitation. Dr. Sherwood Moore, director of the Edward Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University, has found evidence of patched and increased bone texture pressing on the brain in 229 cases of 20,000 X-ray pictures examined. Ninety-eight per cent of the sufferers were women, and their medical history shows ailments which in final stages border on insanity. Dr. Moore believes that the cause for this thickening of the skull is "the failure to follow the natural course of reproduction," especially also the failure of these women to have children. If his opinion is borne out, it will strengthen the protest which physicians have raised against the pernicious physical consequences of birth control. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 10, 1935.)

Some specialists have maintained that birth control is sometimes a cause for sterility, neurasthenia, fibroid tumors, and even cancer. One cannot be unaware of course that a long list of medical men have endorsed birth prevention. Yet we can safely rest our decision with the medical opinion of recognized surgeons and gynecologists, in addition to those already mentioned, like the following: in England Dr. C. P. Blacker; Dr. R. Gibbons, physician to the Grosvenor Hospital; Dr. Ernest Ware, surgeon to St. John and Elizabeth Hospitals; Dr. Hector Cameron, physician to Guy's Hospital; Dr. Mary Sharlieb, gynecologist to the Royal Free Hospital; Dr. Bellingham Smith, senior gynecologist at the London School of Medicine for Women; Dr. Arthur E. Gles, senior surgeon of the Chelsea Women's Hospital; Dr. T. W. Taylor, president of the British Gynecological Society; in Holland Dr. M. A. Boodwdijk-Bastiaanse, eminent gynecologist; Prof. Louwer of Utrecht; in Germany Professor Sellheim of Leipzig; Dr. Max Marcuse, medical editor; in Austria Dr. Sigismund Peller, Viennese specialist; in America Dr. S. J. Homes, zoologist of the University of California; Dr. Howard A. Kelley, gynecologist of Johns Hopkins Medical School; Dr. William Gerry Morgan, past president of the American Medical Association, and many others.

This last-named authority brands all contraceptives as "of mone le heatil he de ared shat hen prated fe opposition to birth control" was based, among other reasons, on "the inevitable and unavoidable harm that it will cause to young women through disturbance and disease, ill health and misery." Before a House Judiciary Committee, Mary T. Norton, representative from New Jersey, declared that thirty-three out of thirty-five leading doctors in her State were opposed to the public dissemination of birthcontrol facts. Finally in its 1937 convention, after twenty-one years' prodding, the American Medical Association approved of birth-control teachings and according to a newspaper report authorized medical schools hereafter to teach "how to space babies to protect the mother's health or the father's bank balance." Shrewd editors intimated that the American Medical Association, face to face with the prevalence of birth control, decided that it could not afford to miss the opportunity of controlling the policy of some 350 birth-control clinics in the United States. At the same time it was suggested by skeptical commentators that the medical profession wanted its share of the $600,000,000 annual commerce in contraceptives!

While controllers tell us that they are generally supported by physicians, it is significant that every reputable doctor who has given any endorsement has spoken very guardedly and has conditioned his remarks, usually by stating that recourse to birth control is to be taken only in the interest of personal health. If that qualification were observed, the ranks of its votaries would be surprisingly thin.

#### AN OUTRAGE AGAINST NATURE

Birth control must be further indicted because it is an unnatural interference with the processes of nature. We cannot laugh this objection away by a sarcastic jibe and say: "If birth control is unnatural, so is cooking, shaving, and wearing glasses; so are houses, radios, and airplanes." These comparisons are on an entirely different plane and involve no moral or primary issues. The love of children is a basic gift of nature, and for Christians this gift is sanctified by the high and holy regard which their faith places upon childhood. Interference with these natural fundamentals must provoke a cataclysm of tremendous proportion. That perhaps is why a European authority, examining 289 letters submitted in advocacy of birth control, declared that he could not find "a single normal mother among them." In fact, restriction teaches intelligent men and women to do what the lowest animal avoids. Man, God's masterpiece, selfishly violates the sacred law of his Creator. We may well harken to the words of Dr. William Gerry Morgan, who declares: "To establish the habit of thwarting nature is in the long run a dangerous practice and invariably leads to moral degradation and disaster."

#### A MORAL DEGRADATION

This suggests the third serious charge. Birth control must be condemned because, immoral, it promotes immorality. In emphasizing the way of escape from the consequences of marriage, it has of course thrown open the door to licentiousness by reducing the unwelcome consequences of promiscuous relations before and after marriage. If it were possible to put into various categories the causes which have contributed to the sexual delinquencies of our day, it would be seen that one of the most potent impulses pushing the sag of American morals to increasingly lower depths is the insistent practice of this prevention.

Newspaper writers, with their literary hand continually on the moral pulse of the nation, have repeatedly conceded this. Miss Genevieve Forbes Herrick of the Chicago Tribune declares: "We are merely reporting that the strict rule of premarital purity is no longer generally enforced, however much it may operate in isolated cases, and that the attitude of young women toward birth control ... has become amazingly lenient in the last dozen years." Miss Gwen Bristow of the New Orleans Times-Picayune admits: "The modern girl does not have to be pure because she knows how to avoid the disastrous consequences of being otherwise. It is a recognized principle of ethics that what constitutes a sin is the evil result of the act."

In a letter addressed to the Hon. Hatton Summers, chairman of the 1934 Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives, Dr. Barton C. Hirst, professor of obstetrics, Graduate School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, summarizes: "I am decidedly opposed to the bill which is to be presented for your consideration on this subject. A number of lay people are interested in this matter not at all for eugenic, altruistic, or medicinal reasons but simply to allow women to escape the usual con-sequences... Unquestionably the spread of this knowledge would increase immorality."

#### A DIVORCE STIMULUS

Dr. Alfred Cahan's A Statistical Analysis of American Divorce (New York Times, April 17, 1932) presents some interesting tables on the relation of childlessness and divorce. Classifying the divorces of 1930 and 1931, he showed that abour 63 per cent of all divorces are issued in childless marriages, 20 per cent with one child, 9 per cent in marriages with two children, 3 per cent in marriages with three children, and 1 per cent in marriages of more than three children. His conclusion is unavoidable; it declares that there is "a dismally low chance for success where children do not force the preservation of the home." How fatal to the hysterical claims that "ignorance of birth control is a fundamental cause of infidelity" is Dr. Cahan's mathematical formula: "As the number of children increases, divorce correspondingly decreases at a geometrical ratio"! Conversely, the decrease in the number of children leads to a proportionate divorce-rate increase. Between 1915 and 1929 the birth-rate dropped from 25.1 per 1,000 to 18.9. This 25-per-cent drop in fourteen years was accompanied by a very definite increase in the divorce-rates, from 2.65 per 1,000 to 4.85, a jump of 52 per cent.

From investigations involving ten years and 5,268 divorced men and women, Dr. George W. Crane of Northwestern University shows that an only child figures in divorce hearings much more frequently than a child in a large family. One divorce in two marriages is the result, he claims, when an only child marries an only child, while one divorce in sixteen marriages is the average figure when a "middle" child (with older and younger brothers and sisters) marries a "middle" child. "It is evident," this Northwestern University sociologist concludes, "that with the reduction in size of family we are bound to increase the divorce rate." As the best antidote for divorce Dr. Crane tells brides and grooms: "Join a church and become an active member! Nothing in society will give you greater protection in your marriage. And then — have several children as soon as possible!"

Supreme Court Justice Lewis of Brooklyn, in a survey ot sixty-four undefended divorce cases that came before him in a single day, discovered that there was but one child for every two couples and that these marriages had lasted on the average fewer than three years. As quoted in the press, Justice Lewis concludes: "I have taken this matter up with my associates on the bench, and between us we have tried thousands of undefended marital cases. It is my conclusion that childless homes are responsible for the almost complete absence of real home-life. I cannot help but reach the conclusion that, if our women had children, there would be more happiness and fewer divorces. Presence of children attracts the husband to his home and keeps the mothers from the gossiping neighbors and bridge parties. Absence of children promotes discord. Their presence makes for harmony. I know of scores of cases where the husband remains home merely for the sake of his love for the children. If such men did not have children, they would leave their wives and either get or give a divorce."

#### A MENACE TO NATIONAL PROSPERITY

Birth control promotes an undesirable decrease in the population, notably in those elements that are essential to proper national development. Conklin (l.c., p. 347) reflects on the lessons of history: "The decay of the most gifted races of the ancient world, especially those of Greece and Rome, was not due primarily to bad heredity nor to bad material environment, but rather to the growth of luxury and selfishness and unrestricted freedom; marriage became unfashionable, immorality was wide-spread, and then came sterility and extinction or mixture with inferior stock and degeneracy."

And Polybius, who was an eye-witness of this decadence, writes: "In our time all Greece was visited by a dearth of children; ... and a failure of productiveness followed... by our men's becoming perverted to a passion for show and money and the pleasure of an idle life and, accordingly, either not marrying at all or, if they did marry, refusing to rear children that were born, or at most one or two out of a great number for the sake of leaving them well off or bringing them up in extravagant luxury." (XXXVI: 17.)

The late Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn of the American Museum of Natural History, New York City, by no means shared any conservative opinion in anthropological and biological issues; but in his address to the Third International Congress on Eugenics, on August 22, 1932, as reported in the New York Times, he asserted: "Birth control, primarily designed to prevent the overpopulation of the unfittest or dysgenesic, may prove to be a two-edged sword, eliminating alike the fittest and the unfittest. Whatever its benefits in limiting the unfittest, birth control is always in danger still more of limiting the fittest and thus becoming positively dysgenesic or against the interests of the race as a whole in which it is practiced. I have in mind the French, among whom birth control has been practiced in the upper classes for centuries, with disastrous racial results. My doubts about the present propaganda and purpose of the birth-control movement are that they are so largely negative and death-dealing rather than positive and birth-encouraging.... For the time at least I am very doubtful about birth control."

Prof. Ferrand Boudhin of Louvaine University, speaking before the Belgian Natality Congress in Brussels, showed that, unless the birth-rate of Western Europe increased, the present races would be overwhelmed by people from the East with larger families. In our own country, Dr. R. Kuczinski of the Brookings Institution has submitted figures to show that despite the annual surplus of births over deaths the present population of the United States is not reproducing itself and that a grave social danger confronts the nation.

A particularly pernicious aspect of this race suicide is stressed by Prof. Ellsworth Huntington of Yale and Leon F. Whitney, executive secretary of the American Eugenics Society, in their book The Builders of America. While the average number of children in the human race is 4.5 per family, the authors show that the wives of 10,636 Harvard graduates average 1.54 children and that 2,694 Vassar College alumnae average 1.1 children in a family. Mount Holyoke's graduates have the same average. Goucher and Radcliffe report 1 and the Wellesley graduates, as far as the records of the alumnae association of that college show, average .75 children for a graduate. Twenty-five per cent of the Harvard men contracted childless marriages in the decade 1891 to 1900, and this rate of childlessness is steadily increasing.

This unfortunate influence is further summarized by Conklin (L.c., 315): "Johnson has shown that 90 per cent of all the women of the United States marry before the age of forty, but that among college women only half that number have married at the same age. As a result of investigations at one of the leading women's colleges he finds that the marriage and birth rate of the most brilliant students, who have been elected members of Phi Beta Kappa, is lowest of all. Cattell says that a Harvard graduate has on the average three fourths of a son, a Vassar graduate one half of a daughter."

An Associated Press dispatch of June 15, 1933, brings extracts from the address of Dr. Barton C. Hirst, who spoke before the American Medical Association at its annual convention in Milwaukee, in which this physician declared that our retarded prosperity may be directly attributable to birth control habits of the country's "better elements." He asserted: "The immense immigration of late years brought to this country some racial strains that were certainly not the best. These peoples are contributing more than their share to our population. If a breeder of live stock defied the laws of eugenics as we do, he would be ruined. We might well ask ourselves if our loss of wealth, our bad government in cities and States, the impotency of Congress, and the wave of dishonesty that has swept the country are not due to a deterioration in the national character.... An undue limitation of fecundity has been one of the precursors to the extinction of a civilization or the subjugation of a people by a more virile and prolific race. We have already gone some distance on this road."

A special committee reported to the 1936 American Medical Association, representing more than 100,000 of the nation's physicians, and declared, as a result of extensive investigations, "that at present the part of our people with the best education and presumably the most competent socially and economically is not reproducing itself and that birth-control propaganda is partially responsible for this condition."

Dr. J. I. J. Hurst of Cambridge University is no scientific alarmist; yet he told the British Association for the Advancement of Science at the annual meeting in Leicester on September 8, 1933, that "owing to the decreasing birth-rate among the more intelligent families the intelligence index of the population is declining so rapidly as to threaten the safety of modern civilization."

In American Women, 1937-38, containing 7,815 biographies of America's most outstanding women, we read that of these 3,339 distinguished women who are married about 68 per cent had no child or only one child.

Investigations of Prof. Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins University bring the startling conclusion that birth control lessens the birth-rate among the better classes, but increases it among the lower. These findings were based on the interrogation of 2,000 women. Will Durant, noted author and lecturer, told the National Convention of School Superintendents in St. Louis (February 27, 1936) that America is "breeding from the bottom and dying at the top" and that birth control menaces the foundation of our society and government. He charged that "the offspring of the educated are limited, while the uneducated produce most of the children," and that "the sly and devious process of birth control is a dangerous and basic aspect of modern life. There can be no great future for a people bred out of the loins of incapacity and ignorance." He climaxed his remarks by asserting that the decline of Rome set in when the Caesars futilely offered money prizes to the patrician women who would bear even one child and "the future Rome was bred out of the loins of the barbarians within, as you are being conquered now. There is no instance where moral life has long survived the decay of religious belief or where civilization has long survived the decay of moral life. What is happening to civilization and to morality in America?" (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, February 28, 1936.)

No prophetic gift of second sight is required to foresee that, if this childlessness, against which public leaders from the time of Augustus to the day of Theodore Roosevelt have protested, con-tinues, cultural disaster will be unavoidable. The empty cribs in intellectual homes will restrict the intelligence growth of the nation, while all childless marriages will directly contribute to the recurrence of economic crises by minimizing the demand for a growing supply. We could well adapt the argument of Goldsmith's vicar and insist that the honest man who marries and brings up a large family does more for his country than the theorist who only talks of population. Prof. Frank G. Dickinson, University of Illinois sociologist, on January 27, 1936, told the Union League Club of Chicago that the taxes to meet old-age pensions should be levied on all childless couples. In his opinion no generation repays the parents who economized, worried, and worked for its rearing, but that each generation discharges the debt as it rears another group of children. Childless adults dodge payment for their own rearing. If, however, they refuse to pay their obligation to society, the State should be empowered to tax them for the cost of old-age assistance. Mrs. Caroline H. Robinson of Swarthmore, Pa., author and teacher, told the twenty-fifth annual meeting (1937) of the Eugenics Research Association: "First, we should tax the childless for the benefit of large families. Second, preach against race suicide. Third, and most important, give tax relief to self-supporting would-be parents by lowering the relief rolls. The enormous flow of useless and degenerate people must be lessened at its source in both city and country slums. Prof. William MacDougall, while in the psychology department of Harvard University, suggested a bonus system to encourage larger families for professional men and called for a reduction of the salary of all bachelors. He is concerned about the critical acuteness of the situation because he admits: "When the classes of the highest worth are persistently less fertile than the mediocre classes, then they must be recruited on a far larger scale by persons drawn from those mediocre classes. There is the possibility that in the course of a few generations any strains of exceptional ability will through intermarriage with much inferior strains regress markedly." No wonder the authors of The Builders of America declare: "If the present tendencies continue, this is likely to be a sad world two or three centuries hence, when both brains and beauty have been fully weeded out!" No wonder Dr. Morgan, when addressing the annual meeting of the New Hampshire Medical Association in Manchester, charged that America's recovery from depression was "retarded by the trend toward Socialism and birth control, both unwholesome and dangerous doctrines, especially at this period of our national life!" No wonder Louis I. Dublin, life-insurance statistician, warns: "The birth-control movement will have much to answer for unless it can square its account with the American people by emphasizing at this very time the need for correctives of its own activities in earlier years. It has placed bundles of dynamite all over the country. It is now high time that it began to bring back, or at least to remove, the fuses!" (Literary Digest, July 22, 1933.)

#### CRAFTY COMMERCIALISM

Another serious objection to birth control is its grasping commercialism. This is shown by a circular distributed freely by a drug store, two short blocks from a St. Louis public school, and published by Medical Bureaus of Information on Birth Control. On the cover, which exalts birth control as "a health necessity in marriage," is a picture of a professional-looking gentleman and under the picture the words: "By Norman Cart, M. D., of London." The obvious intention is to identify Dr. Carr with the picture. This is a rank fraud; for the man in the picture is not Dr. Norman Carr but a professional poser, a model who has appeared in commercial photographs as banker, broker, college professor, actor, World War general, diplomat, social lion, and in many other varied roles. As for Norman Carr, M. D., of London, could no reputable American physician be secured to lend his name to such crafty commercialism? Besides, Dr. Carr is a very elusive character. He is not listed either in the British or the American medical directories, and investigations by the Journal of the American Medical Association seem to indicate that the Medical Bureaus for Information on Birth Control were simply a paper organization, previously called Mothers' Birth-control Clinic, a subsidiary of the company that prepares these preventive devices and materials. The profit-seeking of this ill-famed business looms up in its doubly obnoxious detail when we read the contrast of humanitarian zeal and grasping greed which is found in the literature of the birth-control sales projects. Listen to the mock piety of this paragraph from a widely disseminated birth-control pamphlet: "There are some who say it is not right in the eyes of the Creator. We will allow them to arrogate to themselves the privilege of speaking for God. We are just human beings and claim no divine inspiration. We are willing to rely on that ideal and abide His judgment of a practice than which none other brings so much individual happiness and avoids so much individual misery."

Then read the high-pressure salesmanship in this advertising blurb and see the fine hand of some sales manager behind its despicable traffic:

"Double your money on every sale. The direct-mailed sample (four samples to each physician) and national magazine advertising is putting the spot-light of powerful publicity behind the product that gives you a profit of $8.00 every time you sell a dozen."

There are in our country, according to the estimate of an authority, 300 manufacturers of birth-control devices, and through the euphemisms and double-sense phraseology of magazine advertisements these articles are flaunted before the eyes of the reading public as though all this were not outlawed by the Federal and State laws. Sections 211 and 245 of the United States Penal Code prohibit the sending or receiving by or from the United States mails or an express company any birth-control information or supplies. Yet this illicit business flourishes, and "the average profit on one item ranges from 100 to 300 per cent." (House of Representatives Hearing 5978, p. 142.) A cheap weekly in a recent issue featured with undisguised appeal twenty-three different advertisements for birth-control accessories.

#### ITS ANTI-SCRIPTURAL BIAS

To pass over other objections to birth control, — objections so weighty that these sections of the Federal Penal Code make it a criminal offense, punishable by five years in jail or a fine of $5,000 or both, to send through the mails or through other common carriers "any article, drug or medicine, or any obscene, lewd, or lascivious publication intended for preventing conception," — we come to the basic objection, which, if all other argumentation were swept aside, would be a complete denunciation. We refer to the evident indictment of birth control contained in the statements of Scripture.

The majority report of the Committee on Birth Control appointed by the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America states that the Church and the Bible are "silent upon the subject." This is a bold statement. When the first human parent pair was created, the divine command enjoined: "Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth" (Gen. 1:28). After the Deluge, when the world was to take its second start, the blessing for Noah and his sons again required them to "be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth" (Gen. 9:1). In Ps. 127:3 we read:

Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord, And the fruit of the womb is His reward.

The picture of the ideal home is described in Ps. 128:3:

Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house, Thy children like olive-plants round about thy table.

In Prov. 31:28 children are mentioned as part of the virtuous woman's household. If it is objected that these are Old Testament passages, attention is called to these utterances of the New Testament: 1 Tim. 5:14, where the apostle directs the younger women (the widows) "to marry, bear children"; 1 Cor. 7:14, which illustrates God's gracious interest in His children's children; and particularly Mark 10:14, where the Savior of the race utters His memorable "Suffer the little children to come unto Me." In spite of extended argument not a single passage can be adduced from Scripture which even in any remote way condones birth control; and no one acquainted with the Bible should hesitate to admit that it is a definite departure from the requirements of Scripture. See Gen. 38:9, 10.

#### THE ATTITUDE OF MODERN CHURCHES

A magazine writer calls attention to the significant fact that many leaders of the clergy, far from frowning on birth control, as the Bible does, recognize it as "essential to the welfare of society." The Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America has officially endorsed birth control. Liberal preachers glory in urging it, and the 1934 annual convention of the Young Women's Christian Association approved a plan whereby local associations would work for laws permitting dissemination of birth-control instruction.

The extent to which the clergy participates in spreading this information may be seen in the Maternal Health Association of Missouri, which spreads across its letter-head the notice that it is "affiliated with the American Birth-control League." On the advisory council of this association are the Rt. Rev. William Scar-lett, D. D., bishop of the Episcopal diocese of Missouri; the Rev. Arnold H. Lowe, Presbyterian and past president of the St. Louis Church Federation; the Rev. John W. MacIvor, former head of the Federation and pastor of the largest Presbyterian church in St. Louis; Rabbi Ferdinand M. Isserman of Temple Israel; the Rev. Ivan Lee Holt, former national president of the Federal Council; the Rev. George Rowland Dodson, Church of the Unity; the Rev. R. W. Adair, executive secretary of the Good Will Industries, St. Louis.

To assist Protestant pastors in advising young married couples, the Federal Council of Churches, through its Committee on Marriage and the Home, has issued a pamphlet entitled Safeguarding Marriages. On page twenty-nine it deliberately counsels the clergymen of its constituency: "For the protection of the health of the mothers and of the children and for the best interests of the family he [the pastor] may want to take up the question of the spacing of pregnancies and of making parenthood voluntary rather than merely accidental. The husband and wife may well be cautioned against postponing parenthood too long. At the same time a word needs to be said about the obligation of welcoming the child if one should come at a time when the parents would not have planned it, since no method of birth control is entirely dependable in all cases. The minister will do well to counsel the young people to avoid unsatisfactory and dangerous methods of birth control. He may well urge the use of the most authoritative books dealing with this matter, and better still, that the couple seek the advice of a physician who is skilled in this subject."

To show how these attitudes permeate congregational life, the instance of the Second Baptist Church of St. Louis may be cited. At the morning service of Sunday, January 13, 1935, the pastor asked his audience to vote on this question: "Is it your Christian conviction that adequate scientific information concerning conception and contraception must be made legally and inexpensively available to all married people in order to permit the development of a race of people capable of establishing the kingdom of God?" Apparently the congregation at this liberal church was not large; but it was birth-control-minded; for fifty-nine ballots answered, "Yes"; two, "Uncertain"; and none, "No." (St. Louis Globe-Democrat, January 14, 1935.)

Protesting in the open forum of The Living Church (Epis-copal), a New Jersey pastor thus summarizes the consequences of the resolution accepted by the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in Atlantic City, by which the dissemination of birth-control information was endorsed: "The result of this resolution is that we now have priests who openly sponsor birth control, open their parish-houses to such meetings and addresses by leaders of the movement." (January 5, 1938.)

Such pronouncements cannot decide the issue. No church attacks on the divine gift of children and the nobility of parenthood can justify birth control. As a matter of fact, however, the great body of Christians throughout the world is deliberately opposed to it. The Roman Catholic Church has repeatedly voiced its uncompromising denunciation. The Lutheran Church is definitely arrayed against birth restriction. As for the action of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ (a procedure that will help to speed up the disintegration of this body), insistent voices of religious leaders all over the country have been raised against this arbitrary pronouncement.

#### THE CHURCH'S POSITION

The Church must maintain its emphatic avowal of Christian marriage as God's institution for the propagation of the human race. It must insist that, whenever the divine command "Be fruitful and multiply" is evaded for selfish purposes and through the employment of methods suggested by birth control, divine displeasure is invoked.

This does not mean that the Church establishes an orthodox minimum and insists upon families of ten or twelve children. It has no doctrine of human mass production, nor does it champion the Canadian "$500,000 maternity marathon," started by the extraordinary will of bachelor Charles Vance Millar, Toronto brewer and horseman. He offered a half million to the mother in his city bearing the most children within a decade. Neither does the Church declare that children must follow in rapid succession without sufficient interims for maternal recuperation and infant care. Nor is the health of the mother to be disregarded in the establishment of the family. Her constitution must not be ruined nor her body broken by excessive child-birth. In all of these considerations the Christian principles of love and forbearance must be actuating impulses.

Young couples sincerely concerned over the thought of abnormally large families and the resultant inability to provide adequate means for the cultural growth of their children, should not permit themselves to be disturbed by the alarmist literature of birth-control propaganda. Instead let them consider these five fundamental facts:

First of all, the specter of a prodigal nature that spawns out children and that almost mechanically brings babies year after year in uninterrupted succession is not the picture of nature as it exerts its influences in our lives. There are limits to fertility which are regulated by mysterious factors. The mere physical chances of extraordinarily large families in the average home today (an age that has notable natural trends toward an increase of sterility) are small, particularly in view of the prevalence of late marriages. In Eng-land, Doubleday, Pell, Sutherland, and others have presented strong evidence to show that human fertility is reduced as prosperity, comfort, and intellectuality increase.

Then it dare not be overlooked that "children are an heritage of the Lord," the gift of His rich and undeserved mercy. Thousands of Christian couples have learned by sad and personal experience that this heritage has not been theirs, and even with intense desire and fervent prayer they have been denied the rich blessings from which other short-sighted couples flee in aversion. No child comes into the world without the will and direction of God, and every child born into a Christian home is under all circumstances to be welcomed as the embodiment of a divine benediction.

In the third place, it should be emphasized that there may be certain unobjectionable, if not infallible, means that will help regulate the size of a family. Christian physicians can offer sound advice in emergencies confronting honest young couples who spurn the artificial methods of birth control. The Church has never protested against the employment of those means which the course of nature itself seems to provide, unless their employment is a selfish attempt to evade the responsibilities of parenthood.

The Church also calls attention to continence, self-denial, and restraint. While this often imposes a hopeless struggle on those without the spiritual forces of Christianity, those who take recourse to the power of effective prayer find a sustaining ally in their faith.

Finally, the Church says that in the infrequent and exceptional conflicts between childbirth and maternal health the Christian conscience must seek pastoral advice and the counsel of a Christian physician.

With all this, unusual consideration must be extended to those who have not received the heritage of the Lord from their heavenly Father. No finger of scorn should be pointed at them, no whispers of suspicion raised behind their backs. They should receive the sympathy which Scripture extends to its Hannahs and Sarahs. In their own lives there should be no diminution of heart-deep prayer to the Father above, who "doeth all things well," that the happy gift of parenthood may be theirs. If this blessing is permanently withheld from them, they may find solace when, beholding a helpless infant, orphaned and deprived of parental love and the full opportunities of an unfolding life, they look beyond to see the great Friend of children as He lifts His arms in benediction and tells them: "Whoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth Me" (Matt. 18:5).

#### HAPPINESS THROUGH ADOPTION

Since the problems that are concerned with adoption can best be discussed by those who have personally experienced the joys or sorrows of this new relationship, I offer the following personal record written by a "mother by adoption" in the Walther League Messenger (September, 1934). The wife of one of our Western pastors writes:

"My husband and I were married six years. Each Christmas we thought perhaps on the next there would be a little son daughter with whom to celebrate this happiest of seasons. During these years the mail-man would bring those tiny envelopes announcing the great joy that had come to the homes of our friends. There were times when I thought I could not bear it. My yearnings and longings often turned to a feeling of bitterness and resentment, restlessness, and a chronic dissatisfaction with life in general. It seemed as though my prayers were not being answered and my tears were shed in vain.

"Then came a Mother's Day I shall never forget. My pastor, who is also my husband, preached a sermon which apparently was meant for me. It told about Hannah — how she longed with her heart for a child, how Elkanah tried to console her, saying, 'Hannah, why weepest thou, and why eatest thou not, and why is thy heart grieved? Am I not better to thee than ten sons?' I, too, loved my husband dearly, and we were always the best of companions. Yet no husband can take the place of children. Toward the end of the sermon mention was made of those women who had never been blessed with children of their own, but who were taking homeless children to their hungry hearts and giving them their mother-love.

"We had often spoken of adopting children, but rather vaguely, wistfully, and uncertainly. Only one person had encouraged us. However, my mind was now made up, and I was thrilled when my husband gave his whole-hearted consent.

"About a year after having made out our first application God's guiding hand brought us our David. He was just ten months old at the time. As soon as he saw me, he held out his baby arms and began to whimpet the least little bit, begging m he belonged to me. My husband and I both feel that way. The most wonderful thing about adopting children is the love that a father and mother come to feel for a baby they have embraced as their own. It is a marvelous love. Some people may say that it is not the same as having a child of your own flesh and blood. This may be true. It seems logical. However, in the case of Christian foster-parents, who love the souls of their children, nothing can be stronger, nothing deeper, than the love they give their children, which is a love born of love for Jesus, who said: 'Suffer the little children to come unto Me, ... for of such is the kingdom of God.'

"Now, after all these years, we had a baby in our home. We had suddenly become father and mother. Our parents were now grandfathers and grandmothers for the first time, and our sisters and brothers miraculously turned into aunties and uncles. The general interest shown by our friends was delightful. Swings, buggy, walker, crib, kiddie-kar, clothes, - everything came our way, either as an outright gift to our newcomer or lent until there was occasion for its return.

"Having a child in our home gave us a different insight into the lives of our friends and associates. There seems to be a natural bond of understanding between people who have children, for they have mutual difficulties, anxieties, hopes, and aspirations. Now we could speak more freely on child problems because we spoke from experience. Now we realized why parents take such a keen delight in watching their children's minds and bodies develop; but the greatest pleasure of all, we believed, was the joy of watching them develop spiritually.

"When David was going on three years, he expressed in no uncertain terms his desire for a playmate of his own. His father had told him that for whatever he wanted he must pray, and he prayed for a little brother. After about six months of trustful, confident prayer, as only a child prays, his prayers were answered. We adopted a second baby, our Daniel. He was only three months old and not as strong an infant as was David. So it meant a great deal of care, many watchful nights and anxious days. This only deepened our love for him and the feeling that he was our very own. Now he is growing stronger by leaps and bounds; and when he puts his curly head against my cheek and his soft little arms around my neck, I think, as do thousands of other mothers, that, no matter how much trouble babies are, they surely are worth it, for nothing could be sweeter.

"To be sure, there were a few selfish souls who smiled cynically and spoke of our folly each time we adopted a baby. How did we know how our children would turn out or how could we be sure that they would not become ungrateful, they asked. We had never heard that people got such a guarantee with their own children. Anyway, we were willing to take the chance. Self-gratification was not our objective. Our concern, when taking our boys, lay not in what we would be able to get out of them, but what we could do for them. If purely selfish motives prompted one to this great adventure, disappointment might easily follow.

"The best guarantee of children's character is based on a happy Christian home-life and Christian training. We cannot offer our children an abundance of this world's goods, but we can give them the things that will make for a happy, useful life here on earth and eternal blessedness hereafter.

"Perhaps the question asked most of foster-parents is the 'Are-you-going-to-tell-him-he-is-adopted?' inquiry. Personally, it seems incongruous that a mother who would not hesitate to punish a child severely for telling a lie would, on the other hand, say: 'I wouldn't want the baby ever to know that it wasn't our own,' or: 'I am going away for a few months; and if I can get a young enough baby, no one will ever know he isn't our own? Oh, how often we hear of such secrets' 'leaking out! If a sensitive child discovers that it has been deceived, the shock may mar its future. Even if a child is not sensitive, it may never regain the same attitude toward its parents. Its faith in those whom it has trusted most is shattered. Its whole world of dreams tumbles into ruin. It will feel that a secret has been kept from it during these years and that there has not been that perfect frankness, candor, and honesty that engender the finest confidence between parents and children. Just when most in need of parental sympathy and understanding, during those difficult, critical, adolescent years, the child may withdraw into himself. It is heart-breaking not to teli the child, and for this reason many institutions stipulate as one of their requirements that the parents must tell the children before they are of school age.

"If any parents think their children will love them less for it, they should dispel such thoughts. If a child grows up from babyhood knowing the truth about itself, and from its foster parents, feeling their warm love and seeing every day how they care for it, there will be an unconscious and gradual acceptance of the facts. It is not hard to impress the truth upon a child's mind and to let that truth dawn gradually.

"Then there is this to be considered. Realizing their parents' honesty, adopted children will trust them also in all other things. This feeling of absolute confidence, blended with the realization that out of all the world their foster parents chose just them, should bring only happiness and contentment to the hearts of adopted children.

"Did you know that it was easier to get a baby boy than it is to find a suitable girl? Girls are much more in demand. So are babies just over a year. Parents have an idea of their appearance at that stage. They are then at their most cunning age, respond to affection, and are not the care that an infant would be. How-ever, we were willing to take this additional chance. The schedules and the bottles, the strained spinach and the strained orange juice, the strained bananas and sometimes the strained feelings, all made us feel that the boys were so much more our very own. We would not have missed this period of their young lives for anything.

"Our David is now going on five; Daniel is two years old today; I am writing this on his birthday.

"The time has come when we are planning to add a baby girl to our happy family. We are again asking God to bless and to guide us. A few weeks ago I told David he, too, could include in his daily prayers a request for a little sister, which he did. Lately, however, he made a slight change. He is asking God for twins, 'one for Daniel and one for me.'"

A few years later a baby girl of three months was adopted, and the pastor's wife, thrice a foster-mother, wrote:

"Naturally people wonder, and some ask us, why we do it. Are we perhaps financially independent? No, we are dependent on my husband's income, the average salary of a Lutheran pastor. Haven't we enough to do? Yes indeed! To a pastor who dearly loves his work no life is long enough to complete the precious task of winning souls. No pastor's wife who is faithful in her God-given sphere can ever say that there are days and hours when there is nothing to do or that life is dull and uninteresting. Did we adopt children because we thought that we possessed the makings of model parents? No indeed! The multitudinous tasks of parenthood often prove irksome - the regularity of four-hour formula feedings (especially at six A.M.), the strict monotony of daily washings, the patient, unwavering, consistent, and systematic effort necessary to train each baby through its various stages, each phase growing more difficult as the child grows older. You see, it is not an easy task that we have chosen for ourselves. Nothing, however, is impossible, and there is no limit to what we weak human beings can do, with the necessary determination and God-given strength and wisdom from on high. So when evening comes and sleepy-time; when our little ones have knelt with folded hands and said their prayers; when I pause at each little bed with a final kiss and 'God bless you,' my silent prayer rises heavenward that God would make of my little girl or boy a good Christian and of me an ever better mother.

"Do you wonder that we are not surprised when others ask why we took upon ourselves the responsibility of three children? But it did surprise me when, the other day, one of our boys put the innocent question, 'Mother, why did you adopt me?' Our children know that they are adopted. Our lad merely wanted to know why we had chosen him. The story was easy to tell — how we had gone to an orphans' home, hoping to find a blue-eyed baby girl; how the nurse had brought in a brown-eyed baby boy; how he had begun to whimper and hold out his little baby arms to me; how instinctively I had taken him into my arms and, as his sobs were hushed and the tiny hands clung tightly, he had won his way into my heart forever. 'And that baby was you, my dear, and we took you, and your brother and sister later on and, we hope, another little sister if God wants us to have one, all because we love children and you in particular.'

"That, we believe, is the answer most parents by adoption would give if asked 'Why?' They love children. Some men can immerse themselves in their work to such an extent that the absence of children in the home scarcely affects them. Some women seem satisfied and happy without children, using their womanly talents and instincts in the service of others, in church-work, charity, and in helping to rear or spoil nieces and nephews. But oh, the hundreds of would-be mothers whose arms and hearts are aching and longing in vain for one of God's little ones! My heart goes out to you in your aloneness. You wonder why it is that your prayers remain unanswered, why your consuming desire for a warm bundle of babyhood to press against your breast remains unfulfilled. Your friends have had babies. You have gone to their showers with beribboned little presents. You have visited them in the hospital, with a brave little smile on the outside, while inside you were torn with grief and loneliness. Perhaps you, too, have dreamed such vivid dreams that at the time left no doubt as to their being true, only to awaken and find your arms still empty and hot tears of disappointment running down your cheeks.

"Now curiosity and interest might prompt you to ask the question: 'Under what circumstances is it not advisable to adopt a baby, supposing a couple is willing and able?' If the child is not mentally and physically well, it would surely behoove future parents to weigh the added responsibility which such a charge might bring. We believe that you will also agree that it is wrong to adopt a child for selfish reasons; for instance, to apply for a beautiful child so that you can 'do yourself proud' and dress it like a little Lord Fauntleroy or Shirley Temple is selfish and therefore also wrong. Roger Babson says that one of the best investments that we can make in these days of change and uncertainty is — children. But if we do it for selfish reasons, such as our own pleasure, or if we expect something in return, that is wrong. It is true, children multiply happiness in a home a thousandfold, especially during holiday seasons; but should not happiness exist before children are brought into a family? Take a helpless piece of humanity where love and peace do not already reign supreme, and you do it an injustice. You may rear it according to the finest baby specialists' schedules; you may plan its educational and social problems from A to Z, but unless a little one goes into a home where it feels that mother and father are happy together and love each other because they first love the Savior, it grows up in an atmosphere that will sooner or later become detrimental to its finer development. Where there is dissension in the home, the coming of a child may only increase the differences; for example, in the matter of its training. Eventually the child may grow up to cling to either father or mother, taking sides against the other, whether justly or not. Having an ally in one parent, it will refuse to obey the other or, what is even more deplorable, secretly learn to go its own way.

"This brings to mind another question often raised, whether we aren't worried as to how our children will turn out. A friend of mine from one of our Mid-Western towns put it this way: "Why bother about children? You can't tell how they will turn out. When they are little, you work for them, watch over them, and worry about them. Then they grow up, and what have you? They don't respect their elders; they go and do as they please; they get into bad company, and then comes trouble, Poor soul! \* She had two sons. When they were small, all seemed well. For a while they even attended Sunday-school. But the father was an un-believer, a gambler, and a drinker. As the boys grew older, they got into undesirable company and went from bad to worse. Today both are behind penitentiary bars in different parts of the country. — Do such stories of parents with their own children discourage me? you may ask. No, not in the least; but they do show me that there is a great deal of truth in the statement that thought patterns of a child are often formed before it is three years old. Some one has also said that the proper place to begin curbing the crime wave is not in the electric chair, but in the high chair. Above all, such experiences convince me more than ever that Christian training, beginning with babyhood days, and the Christian example of father and mother are of the utmost importance in the life of any child.

"Another well-meaning mother, also with children of her own, put another angle to the question. She observed, 'Oh, well, if your children don't turn out good, you can at least say that you did your best. It is different if they aren't your own? No, a thousand times no! I would rather lay down my life than see one of these children come to harm in body or in soul. The writer of Ecclesiastes says: "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.' If you or I or any one adopts a child with a lukewarm, half-hearted, maybe-he'll-turn-out-all-right-and-maybe-he-won't attitude, then we have no business adopting children. Only if we put forth every effort possible to bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, constantly praying for their temporal and spiritual well-being, can we rest assured that God's gracious will is being fulfilled in us and in our adopted children. In the case of these children such an effort often requires unusual courage. Many foster-parents say, 'I am not going to be so strict because our child is adopted.' They are afraid that without the ties of flesh and blood their hold on the child may not stand the strain. of severe discipline. These are only foolish fears if we remember that there are far stronger ties that bind the hearts of children to the parents. These are the ties of Christian faith and love, which will withstand the severest strains and endure for all eternity.

"To establish and strengthen these ties, we must take as our guide in child-training the best text-book that ever was or ever will be written on the subject, God's own book, the Bible. How simple it is, with God's counsels as our guide, to get the correct answers to even the most baffling problems! And what a blessing it is when God's Word begins to take hold of the child's heart! One day, while I was washing dishes, our little six-year-old, who had just begun his first year in parochial school, came with a towel and the remark, 'Mama, I'm going to dry dishes for you "that it may be well with me and I may live long on the earth."' Of course, we find that some children are not so receptive and responsive as others. For them we must pray more; to them we must come more often with the Word of God.

"After all is said and done, adopting children is truly worth the effort. The joy that our children have brought us during the past years also brings to mind what they have meant to us other-wise. In the first place, our children have brought us closer to our Savior. Since we have had our little flock, prayer has a deeper meaning, and we have come to realize more than ever how dependent we are on Almighty God. Without God at my side I would not want to rear children. It would be too big a job. We have learned that with the adoption of children a finer spirit of cooperation enters the home. Husband and wife learn to appreciate each other more. The added responsibilities bring out the finer qualities in both, which might otherwise have remained dormant and unnoticed. Again, we feel that our children have given us a liberal education, which we could have acquired in no other way. Our youngsters have also taught us to stretch our dollars (sometimes a rather painful procedure) so that we believe we have more good packed into every cent of income and can make it go farther than we have ever dreamed. Since we have adopted the children, we have learned to appreciate and better understand other people's joys and sorrows with their children. We have become thankful for our own parents and for what they did for us in our childhood.

"To my way of thinking there is no greater satisfaction in life than that which comes from having children, helping them grow into God-loving and worth-while, healthy-bodied and healthy-minded young men and women, teaching them self-control, coopera-tion, thoughtfulness, and usefulness. A mother may be 'dog-tired' at the end of each day, so that she goes to sleep almost before she gets both feet in bed. But for real satisfaction, for a constant source of happiness and a worth-while object in life, there is nothing that compares with rearing children. The author who writes a prize novel, the painter who paints a masterpiece, the architect who builds the most beautiful structure in the world, cannot begin to compare his work with that of the father and mother who, with God's help, mold a tiny life that some day may influence thousands and whose immortal soul will one day shine as a star in the everlasting firmament of God's New Jerusalem, when all the perishable masterpieces of men will have crumbled into dust."

Experience as codified by the Child Welfare League of America in its "New Adoption Program" emphasizes the following safeguards that should be extended both to the adopted child and the foster-parents:

1.  The identity of the adopting parent should be kept from the natural parent, just as the identity of the natural parent should be concealed from the adopting parent.
2.  The family that seeks the adoption should have a good home and a normal family life, with the prospective parents well adjusted to each other.
3.  The child selected should have the physical and intelligence characteristics required to meet "the reasonable expectation" and the home standards of the adopting parents.
4.  Foster-parents should understand that in adopting a child "they assume as serious and permanent an obligation as do parents rearing their own children."
5.  Before formal adoption there should be a trial period in which the child actually resides with the prospective adopting parents.
6.  The child to be adopted should "be wanted for the purpose of completing an otherwise incomplete family group, in which he will receive support, education, loving care, and acquire the feeling of security to which every child is entitled."
7.  Every possible precaution should be taken to shield the child from any embarrassment connected with his birth, for example, illegitimacy.
8.  The question as to whether the child's adoption is to be revealed must be dealt with honestly.
9.  The formality of adoption is to be completed without any publicity.
10. Christian foster-parents will thank God for the privilege of being able to bring the adopted child to Christ and will steadfastly pray that the foster relation be hallowed by the Savior's Spirit.

### DIVORCE

What, therefore, God hath joined together let not man put asunder. - Mark 10:9

Periodically American newspaper-readers have been entertained with livid accounts of the divorce orgy in Soviet Russia, where, until recently, the official fracture of the marriage vow has steadily become easier, quicker, cheaper. In the first days of the Soviet régime the average divorce required twenty-two minutes; but that was before Red authorities had profited by practical acquaintance with modern methods. Now, we are told, by substituting up-to-date files for the old cumbersome registry ledgers, a Moscow divorce is granted in twelve minutes and at proportionately reduced fees.

Before we shake our heads and draw unwarranted comparisons emphasizing our American moral superiority, let us listen to the grinding of our own divorce mills as they roll on in the creak and whirl that would delight many a Red commissariat. The following picture, drawn by A. B. MacDonald, Pulitzer-prize winner for 1931, sketches the Reno divorce debauch: "Divorces are handled here by two judges in two courts. I spent a day in those courts and saw the mill grind out many divorces. If the case is uncontested, the procedure is very simple. Suppose it is the case of Mrs. Jones against Mr. Jones. The judge calls:

"'Case No. 7,500, Jones versus Jones.'

"Lawyer Smith arises and says, 'Ready, Your Honor,' and he beckons to Mrs. Jones and a woman who accompanies her, and they step forward and are sworn. The judge asks, 'Is the defendant represented here?' and thereupon a lawyer arises and states that he represents Mr. Jones and that he does not desire to contest the case.

"Mrs. Jones takes the witness chair, and her lawyer asks her a few questions: her name, former residence, when married whether she has lived in Reno continuously for forty-two days, and if it is her intention to maintain her residence in Nevada, and 'How did your husband treat you?' 'He neglected me,' 'failed to provide,' or, 'he deserted me,' are the usual replies. Just a few short questions and answers.

"Then the plaintiff's witness is called and swears that she keeps a boarding-house or hotel or apartment at such a place and that Mrs. Jones has resided there continuously for forty-two days. It must be a 'continuous residence' for forty-two days. The applicant is not allowed to leave the jurisdiction of the court for even one day, or he or she might spend money elsewhere.

"Having heard these two witnesses, the judge gives the papers in the case a flip and smooths them out on his bench. He seizes a pen and cries out in a singsong voice the old formula: "Case No. 7,500: Jones versus Jones, decree of divorce granted, as prayed for, to the plaintiff.'

"His pen scratches as he talks; he blots the entry, tosses the paper over to the clerk of the court, and calls the next case. Generally it has all been done in two minutes."

With this two-minute rate Reno seems to have snatched the record for speedy divorces from Chicago. A newspaper reporter in that city, visiting a branch of the circuit court, saw a total of fifty divorces granted in two hours and fifteen minutes!

Not all divorces are rushed through at this high-speed rate. When impending separations involve public idols or individuals who can be counted upon for heavy head-lines, the process may be apparently more deliberative, the gestures more serious. Yet in the instance of some widely discussed divorces the judicial speedometer has registered surprisingly high. When Senator William Gibbs McAdoo, former Secretary of the Treasury, was divorced from the daughter of the late President Wilson in a hearing that lasted a little more than half an hour, Frank C. Collier, presiding judge of the Superior Court of California, announced an investigation of the speed with which this divorce was granted. Of course, no action was taken. A judicial inquiry would perhaps be more in place in the later Reno divorce of Mrs. Anna Roosevelt Dall. This was granted in ten minutes and behind closed doors, — "out of deference to the President of the United States." Barbara Hutton Mdivani, five-and-ten-cent-store heiress, was divorced from her Georgian prince after a ten-minute Reno hearing. The same evening she danced at a crowded night club with Count Kurt Haugwitz-Reventlow, whom she married two days later.

#### A NATION OF HOME-BREAKERS

Not only is the legal red tape of the divorce trial snipped to a minimum, but State Legislatures have run a neck-to-neck race in the competitive effort to make the required residence shorter. In some of our Western States the divorce business in point of financial return ranks next to the most productive of the legalized industries, a prolific source of income to be cultivated and coddled with legislative protection. That is why, when Arkansas and Idaho had reduced their residence requirements and Reno, the "nation's divorce capital," was threatened with a loss of $3,000,000 annual income, the Nevada Legislature in 1931 cut the period of legal sojourn to only six weeks. The best Arkansas could do was to establish a ninety-day residence, permitting either husband or wife to petition for divorce sixty days after establishing the Arkansas residence. When the Supreme Court of that State, on November 23, 1933, finally removed all legal obstacles to this enactment, hotels of Arkansas issued a booklet entitled A New Approach to Freedom, with this introductory paragraph of propaganda: "This new measure brings freedom from marital ties within reach of thousands of people, who may at the same time enjoy benefits of Arkansas' mild, invigorating climate."

When the Montana Legislature, early in 1939, passed a bill declaring that it would be legal in that State to file divorce action after only thirty days, thus reducing by twelve days the requirements of Nevada and neighboring States, newspapers admitted: "Sponsors of the divorce measure make no effort to conceal its commercial purpose." Neither did the chief executive of Montana conceal his conviction. When Governor Roy E. Ayers vetoed the bill, he stated: "Montana does not want to profiteer on others' misfortunes. I do not believe Montana should have the stigma of commercializing on the unsuccessful and the unfortunate marriage and the domestic troubles of her sister States."

More recently Florida began to lower its bars. Under legislation passed during the spring, 1935, session at Tallahassee and signed by the governor, divorces will now be granted in any part of America's Riviera State after a ninety-day stay. Representative Frost frankly called the new code Florida's bid for the lucrative divorce trade. In the first session of its 1935 Legislature, Wyoming reduced the legal period from one year to sixty days, under the hearty approval of resort-owners, dude ranchers, and local attorneys. Not only is the divorce service in these States granted after a minimum of time, but much is done to facilitate divorce. In his report on migratory divorces, recently published by the Law School of Duke University, Rollo Bergeson declares: "If you should direct a single inquiry, you would shortly be flooded with offers of services which would take care of you from the moment you leave your own doorstep until, decked out with a new divorce, you reach whatever destination you have in mind, extras included." (New York Herald-Tribune, November 17, 1935.)

So the race is on, with three States in Mexico, Morelos, Sonora, and Chihuahua, among the latest entrées in this sordid competition. These Mexicans, it is said, are responsible for much insomnia on the part of the less reputable in our legal profession, since the trans-Rio Grande attorneys are willing to grant uncontested divorce without any legal residence. Just across from El Paso, for example, a divorce mill in Juarez advertises that for $200 a decree may be obtained even though the petitioning parties have never been within 1,000 miles of Juarez. The circulars of an El Paso lawyer, advertising his Mexican connections, claim that in 1934 more divorces were issued across the river in Juarez than in Reno. Chihuahua lawyers boasted of 5,000 trials in a single year. These Mexican "mail-order" divorces are often granted after mock trials, in which no serious effort is made to serve papers or conduct an impartial hearing. And now comes Peru, offering to foreigners divorce by "mutual consent" as soon as they set foot on Peruvian soil, Ecuador introducing quick and easy divorce laws, El Universo, the Guayaquil daily, nominating that city as the divorce mecca, and Brazilian centers lining up for a cut in these spoils. Paris used to be the scene of many American divorces; but Havana is so much nearer, and the legal procedures there are attained so much more cheaply that the Cuban capital has forged ahead of French competition. The New York Herald-Tribune, discussing these foreign divorces, declares (November 17, 1935): "Travel agencies and hotels naturally have collaborated with lawyers in making these divorce quests enjoyable where the parties appear in person. Divorce tours, with all arrangements completed in advance, have been offered."

American ingenuity will meet foreign rivalry in this field as it has in others. Even if the plan of an astute Westerner, who proposes that his State grant divorces by mail, without the inconvenience of a transcontinental trip, may prove too radical for his liberal-minded associates, somehow America will manage to maintain its unenviable leadership in divorces. When easier and quicker divorces are granted, this country will grant them. The notorious distinction of being a nation of many home-breakers will remain ours. With one divorce for almost every six American marriages, with more divorces granted in the United States within the last thirty-five years than in all the rest of Christendom combined, we are living in an age that flaunts its marriage wrecks.

Alfred Cahan has shown that, while the population of the United States increased by more than 200 per cent between 1867 and 1929, and while marriages grew by 400 per cent during this period, the divorce-rate in these sixty-two years had advanced 2,000 per cent. Similarly it is no pleasant picture of the American home which Statistician Louis I. Dublin drew in an address before a New York audience in this discouraging comparison: "In 1887 there were 5.5 divorces for every 100 marriages; in 1900 there were 7.9, and in 1930, 17" And he finished the comparison by warning: "Out of every 9 marriages now existing, 2 are likely to end in divorce."

Sir Wilfred Grenfell, internationally known medical missionary to Labrador, says, by contrast, that the natives of that country never have a divorce. "The families," he reports, stick together to the last ditch."

A bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, returning from India, protested that educated Hindus point to the riotous prevalence of divorce in our country and ask, "What has Christianity done for you?" Confucianists and Shintoists in Japan can well level the finger of scorn at us; for the divorce rate of heathen Nippon has steadily declined, while "Christian" America's just as steadily increases. In 1901 Japan had 140 divorces in every 100,000 of its population; but by 1923 this figure had been reduced to 88. We, on the other hand, had 79 divorces for every 100,000 of our population in 1901, but in 1926 we had 154, - almost the double of the Japanese figure. (American Journal of Sociology, Novem-ber, 1930, p. 35 fF.)

A cross-section of upper-crust American society, as affected by the divorce scandal, is pictured by the following item from Broadway Brevities: "James H.R. Cromwell was a member of Jimmie Walker's [now divorced and married to Betty Compton, actress] party, ... son of the late Oliver Cromwell of New York. His mother, Eva Roberts, later married Edward T. Stotesbury, Philadelphia millionaire, becoming his second wife. James Cromwell was divorced by Delphine Dodge, who later married Raymond T. Baker, former director of the Mint. Baker was previously divorced by Margaret Emerson, Baltimore heiress. Margaret first divorced Smith McKim and then became the second wife of the late Alfred G. Vanderbilt.

"After divorcing Baker, she chose as her fourth husband Charles Minot Amory, whose first wife, Gladys Munn, is now Mrs. Herbert Pulitzer. Before James Cromwell was divorced by Delphine Dodge, he had a most picturesque father-in-law. Delphine's mother, the widowed Mrs. Horace E. Dodge, who inherited many millions from the automobile industry, chose as her second husband Hugh McGaughey of Columbus, who became an actor as Hugh Dillman and was divorced by Marjorie Rambeau after she had divorced Willard Mack. James Cromwell's brother, Oliver Eaton Cromwell, was divorced by Hope Beale and married Katharine Dahlgren after she had divorced Richard Smith Emmett. The heiress sister of James and Oliver Cromwell, Louise Cromwell, divorced Walter B. Brooks, Jr., who then married Marian Rice, and Major-General Douglas MacArthur before marrying Lionel Atwill, the actor. Atwill was first divorced by Phyllis Relph, actress, and then divorced Elsie Mackay, actress."

#### NO PROMISE OF IMPROVEMENT

The outlook holds little promise for future improvement. If the rate of divorce increase reached within the last decade or two continues until 1950, about one fourth of all marriages will end in divorce at that time. By 1990 one half will be similarly terminated. This specter is no hare-brain hallucination; for all symptoms, even by hasty diagnosis, point to a continued advance in domestic disruption. Almost every piece of divorce legislation rushed through our State Assemblies is designed to aid the splitting of American familiies, to "modernize domestic legislation," as the Chicago Tribune labels its support of liberalized marriage laws (April 11, 1933). The very men whose office charges them to uphold the sanctity of the American family and to execute faithfully the laws safeguarding the home are often the first to support radical divorce proposals. A Reno judge who in twelve years granted 20,000 divorces — a pronounced exponent of easy and repeated marriage and a disgrace to any American bench - invites the unhappily married: "Come, to Reno, get a divorce, and try again for the prize in the matrimonial lottery and keep on trying until you find true love." This legal ballyhoo helps account for the fact that there is no depression in Reno, where during a recent year more than one divorce for every two marriages was recorded. Not only at Reno have divorce rates increased. In the city of St. Louis, during 1935, 2,531 local couples severed their marital ties, while only seven petitions for domestic freedom were denied. Assuming that the domestic courts function eight hours a day, on the five days they convene, this figure (an increase of 37 per cent over 1933) represents an average of about one divorce each hour.

Much of present-day literature shouts its approval of the current breakdown in marriage. In 1888 a young woman wrote a letter to the etiquette editor of the Ladies' Home Journal asking about the propriety of cartying a portse usefulie ind minder. able propriety of the parasol, this feminine appendage caters to vanity and is conducive to flirtation. Fifty years later, in 1938, the same Ladies Home Journal conducted an extensive investigation and among other things showed that 69 per cent of America's women "favor divorce."

What changes in public and domestic morals will the next fifty years bring if the past five decades have leaped from questioning the parasol to favoring divorce?

If American magazines, including the home journals, continue on the course which they have taken during the past few years and keep on featuring and fondling divorce, giving their readers the impression that, while it is a necessary evil, it is to be condoned and sometimes to be applauded, the divorce rate will skyrocket to new heights. And if people in high positions of public life, like Mrs. Roosevelt, discuss divorce without definite, repeated, and systematic warnings against this domestic evil, we may see that the number of shattered families in our country will approach the toppling figures in Russia before Soviet statesmen began to put legal brakes on the divorce machinery.

Mrs. Roosevelt and other magazine writers on this subject are, of course, entitled to their opinions; but when we read head-lines like this, "First Lady for Divorce if Incompatibility Is Issue," and then in an International News dispatch notice, "Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt was on the side of divorce advocates today," who can measure the disastrous potentialities that may arise from such statements? When the mistress of the White House tells the American people that she believes divorce to be "necessary and right" if husband and wife find that they cannot live happily together, she has done irreparable damage. Thousands of selfish, misguided young couples will read this pronouncement and immediately conclude that, if Mrs. Roosevelt is for divorce and if the Ladies' Home Journal, normally a conservative magazine, features this dissolution, it must be right, proper, fashionable, and modern.

Typical by his heavy applause is Gilbert Frankau, English novelist: "It is true there is more divorce since the war, but that is because there is less concealment of lost affection and more frank-ness. Now a wife who no longer loves her husband tells him so frankly, tells him she has more affection for some one else. Then there's a divorce, and she marries again, and that is the more honest way. And it's much better than carrying on deceit." (New York Evening Post, April 21, 1926.) Theodore Dreiser admits: "When I contemplate the Russian, as opposed to our own, marriage and divorce systems, I can only wish that the Russian system could apply." (Divorce, p. 50.) Lion Feuchtwanger, novelist banned from Germany, pictures the ideal state as issuing marriage contracts that must anticipate divorce. He explains: The state "would have to provide that in all circumstances marriage contracts should contain provision for the imminent possibility of a severance. These contracts would have to contain a clause stipulating that at the wish of either of the two contracting parties the contract must be severed without delay." (L.c., p. 90.) Arnold Bennett hails this as "an elasticity by which society will assuredly profit." His own prophecy regarding marital liberality one hundred years hence follows: "I am convinced that in 2035, if one or both of a married pair demand a dissolution of the bond after having ceased to live together conjugally for a prescribed period, the bond will be dissolved on the strength of that plea alone. Such a development, when the time comes, will be generally welcomed and approved." (Southtown Economist, March 1, 1936.)

Radical sociologists, of course, have hailed easy divorce as an essential blessing for modern married life. The late Havelock Ellis candidly declared: "The greater facility of divorce aids the formation of the most satisfactory unions." (Whither Mankind, p. 209.) Beatrice Forbes-Robertson Hale insists: "The divorce and remarriage of childless couples or of those whose children are grown is a private and, racially speaking, an insignificant affair." Bertrand Russell concludes: "To sum up, where there are no chil-dren, divorce should be obtainable at the request of either party. Where there are children, the usual ground should be mutual consent." (Divorce, p. 18.)

Even less radical sociologists glorify divorce. Dr. Paul J. Zentay, president of the Social Hygiene Association of Missouri, frankly told the members of the Saint Louis Hebrew Young Men's Association: "The best interests of partners in marriage are served if divorce is made easier. The only criterion of marriage is the willingness of two people to live together. The Russian experiment in liberalizing marriage laws, after the first burst of licentiousness, has resulted in more stability for monogamy than exists in America or England." (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 9, 1935.)

#### WHAT IS WRONG WITH DIVORCE?

With the endorsement of legislators, and the support of liberal church-leaders, sociologists, and men of letters, increasing multitudes are asking, "Well, what is wrong with divorce? Why should not two people who are tired of living together have the privilege of living their own lives separately and apart? Why should a husband and a wife who are unhappily married be condemned to a life sentence of mutual misery? What," they repeat, "is wrong with divorce?"

Our answer must be quick and clear: "Everything is wrong with it." Few tragedies in human experience are as devastating as this judicial separation; for it strikes, first of all, at the heart of marriage and thus at the foundations of our civil well-being. If, as the Supreme Court of the United States has de-clared, "it [marriage] is an institution in the maintenance of which in its purity the public is deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the family and of society without which there would be neither civilization nor progress," then any trend or system which attacks this institution condemns itself as hostile to public and personal welfare. Indeed, if there is one lesson that stands out with prominence on the pages of universal history, it is this: Wherever the cancer of divorce remains unchecked, this malignant growth eats its way into the vitals of national existence. During the early years of Roman history this evil was quite unknown; but when the state was cursed with vice and the softness of easy prosperity, free divorce and the resultant license were so wide-spread that legal separations could be secured by the husband or wife who expressed the desire in writing. Disintegration of the Roman empire was just as inevitable as the decay that followed the debauchery of promiscuous divorce in Islam, Greece, Persia, Babylonia.

We in the United States will do well to remind ourselves that no nation has ever been stronger than its homes. With four million people divorced in our country (more than our entire population at the time of the Declaration of Independence), we must realize that the most dangerous menace to the nation's healthy progress is to be found not in the menace of foreign coalitions or in the secret development of instruments of mass annihilation, but in the termite destruction of divorce. This leaves the veneer of our much-vaunted culture undisturbed but eats away the pillars supporting the dome of our national decency until they become hollow props swaying uncertainly before the crash of inevitable collapse.

Divorce must, evoke resentment particularly because of its blight on the lives of children; and children are affected in four of every ten divorce decrees. All boys and girls born in the United States have certain claims which their parents must respect. They have a right to the warmth and comfort of a home, to mental and religious training, and, above all, love. When the specter of divorce enters a home, the children lose either father or mother, sometimes practically both. It has been estimated that there are in this country no fewer than 500,000 of these legal half-orphans, and any one who knows these unfortunate children understands that they rarely escape without a handicap in life.

That delinquencies in crime are often the products of divorce and separation is shown by sociological investigations. Dr. William F. Lorenz, chief of the Wisconsin Psychiatric Institute, learned that 52 per cent of the inmates of the Industrial Home for Wo-men, 50 per cent of the Industrial School for Girls, 41 per cent of those in the State Reformatory for Boys, 39 per cent in the Industrial Home for Boys, and 35 per cent in the State Reformatory came from broken homes. Forty-three out of every one hundred persons sentenced to Wisconsin penal and corrective institutions have lived in disrupted homes. (Chicago Tribune, October 4, 1926).

Ernest H. Shiller of the University of Chicago tabulated the home history of nearly 8,000 boys in reformatories and corrective institutions. More than 50 per cent of the detained boys came from broken families. This shows that incidence of delinquency is several hundred per cent greater for children of divorced parents than among normal youth. A two-year study of New York criminal records reveals that 47 per cent of those convicted of major crimes likewise came from disrupted families.

Dr. Frank L. Christian, superintendent of the Elmira, New York, Reformatory, classified the 1,500 inmates of this corrective institution in this way: "About 55 per cent of them came from homes broken by death, desertion, or divorce. The responsibility for family support fell on the remaining parent, usually the mother. Desertion, bitterness, and the loss of sympathetic understanding had destroyed discipline and made home a good place to get away from." (Chicago Tribune, October 5, 1926.)

During 1933 about 500 young men, drifting down-and-outers, job-seekers, and adventurers, daily passed through Des Moines, Iowa, on the long freight trains rumbling through the portal to the West. Fred Johnson, district special agent to the Great Western Railway, who studied these migrants, asserts that "75 per cent are youths who have been deprived of home-life through divorce and death." (New York Times, July 22, 1934.)

From a survey by a University of Pittsburgh sociology student it was learned that 50 per cent of all children haled before Pittsburgh courts for theft, immorality, property damage, and similar delinquency came from broken homes. This ratio becomes especially significant when we are told that 18 per cent of the Pittsburgh homes are disrupted.

"A great majority of the delinquent girls and boys who appear in juvenile court," declares Judge McNabb of the Fort Wayne Juvenile Court, "come from homes that have been broken, principally by desertion or divorce. Therein lie some of the greatest tragedies in life.... We see too many cases in which the man cares for another woman, his wife cares for another man, and neither of them cares for their children."

The composite description of the typical American criminal made by seasoned criminologists attending the 1936 International Association of Chiefs of Police starts in this way: "A lazy, vain, moderately educated city youth whose parents have separated." And these experts in crime conclude: Broken homes contribute the bulk of new recruits for crime's vast army.

The divorced wife pays the heaviest penalty. She who previously enjoyed her husband's support frequently finds herself in a financial dilemma, from which not even a grudgingly paid alimony can completely extricate her. We have instruments to measure many of the convulsive forces of nature; but human ingenuity will never devise any meter for gaging the suffering of the divorced woman whose home is a single room in a crowded lodging-house, whose battle for existence is waged in laundries, factories, or calloused business offices. Even in cases where the wife is the innocent party and the court awards her financial support, the divorce may carry a certain stigma with it, at least in many circles, and always involves new burdens and handicaps.

Though the salary of the divorced husband continues much as before, he, too, pays a high price for his freedom. This may be exacted in the payments of the alimony by which the law of the land compels him to maintain, partially at least, the financial provision of his marriage pledge; or he may pay in that approach to social ostracism by which society in the better circles of life protests against the violation of the marriage code; or he may suffer with the disillusionment and the spiritual impoverishment which often follow divorce. Sometimes this remorse and distress drive the divorced to suicide. Dr. Frederick L. Hoffman, insurance statistician, has furnished this comparative table for New York City showing the suicide ratio for married and divorced people of both sexes:

|          | Male  | Female |
| -------- | ----- | ------ |
| Married  | 34.1  | 15.0   |
| Divorced | 113.5 | 61.2   |

\The decidedly higher suicidal tendency of the divorced is apparent. Underneath the bravado of divorce there often linger the deep ache and the numb pain of despair.

In fact, our entire social structure is penalized by divorce, particularly because of the dishonesty and connivance with which it is all too frequently associated. With the prohibition amendment erased from our Constitution, no aspect of American legal life remains in which fraud flourishes as brazenly as in our divorce litigation. A husband assumes the guilt of an erring wife. Evidence is manufactured by professional divorce detectives. The divorce is prearranged by collusion outside of court and then secured on the basis of some technicality within the court. Nine out of every ten divorce suits are uncontested.

In McCall's for May, 1936, Attorney Richard A. Knight asserts that only about 2 per cent of the divorces granted under Nevada laws at Reno have legal validity, since the Supreme Court of Massachusetts has upheld the claim, as did the United States Supreme Court, that in a contested Reno divorce Massachusetts merely for divorce purposes, was a sham.

Divorce as an invitation to fraud and perjury is denounced by jurists who preside over domestic-relations courts. Listen to Judge William E. Hirt of Erie, Pennsylvania: "By far the largest number of decrees are granted on the charge of indignities. What is meant by such indignities the law does not define but depends largely upon the circumstances of each case, though it must consist in such a course of conduct as is humiliating, degrading, and inconsistent with a spouse's position and relation as such. This last ground especially opens the door rather wide to fraud in the courts. It is a rule of law that no divorce will be granted where there is collusion between the parties. But how is the court to know that collusion is not present since most of the divorce actions are prosecuted ex parte and are uncontested? I suspect in a large percentage of cases that the respondent is just as anxious for a decree as the complainant and is willing that the complainant, in his absence, exaggerate the facts relied on, to the point of producing the minimum of proof necessary for a decree. That there is exaggeration to the point of perjury is indicated by the fact that, where the respondent does appear and where both sides are heard, a decree is not often entered. But which grounds for divorce shall be recognized as valid is not of great importance so long as people want divorces and are willing to go the required lengths to secure them. In States where infidelity constitutes the sole recognized ground for divorce, we may believe, as is reported upon good authority, that in many cases, by collusion, circumstances are arranged in advance to give the appearance of the offense, to the degree required by legal standards of proof, when in fact the offense has not been committed at all."

#### THE BIBLE ON DIVORCE

With these dire consequences the position of the Bible may be anticipated. Indeed, the fundamental charge which the Church hurls against divorce is this, that it runs directly counter to Christ's plain teachings. All other indictments, striking as they are, can be only secondary.

According to the divine attitude marriage can terminate in one, and only one, way without provoking God's displeasure. That way is indicated in the marriage pledge that promises faithfulness "until death you do part." When the Creator instituted matrimony, He made no provision for the separation of husband and wife, who are to "cleave together" (Gen. 2:24), an injunction wilfully violated by divorce. Marriage, according to divine ordinance, is indissoluble, a lifelong union. No matter how, why, or by whom the marriage relation is torn apart before death, either husband or wife has sinned and broken the permanency of that first blessed institution.

This is the evident teaching of our Lord. When tempting Pharisees put this direct question to Jesus: "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?" He ruled, after directing their attention to the divine institution of marriage, "What therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder" (Mark 10:9). After the Pharisees left and His disciples, harking back to the early Hebrew divorce procedure (conceded to the Israelites because of the hardness of their heart), again brought the question to the attention of the Savior, His second answer was even more direct and compre-hensive: "Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her. And' if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another, she committeth adultery" (Mark 10:11, 12). It must be incontrovertibly evident from these passages (the truth of which is regarded as so vital that it is repeated in Matt. 19:6 and Luke 16:18) that Jesus brands divorce as diametrically opposed to the divine will.

To impress us, the divine injunction "Let not man put asunder" is restated in the epistles. In Rom. 7:2 the separation by death is the only dissolution of the marriage relation; for the apostle says: "The woman which hath an husband is bound by the Law to her husband so long as he liveth." To add surety to surety, Scripture in 1 Cor. 7:39 again states in similar language: "The wife is bound by the Law as long as her husband liveth." A careful reading of these passages must remove every suggestion of doubt as to the Bible's attitude on divorce: it is branded as a sinful repudiation or evasion of the divine will.

Is there no exception to this comprehensive, sweeping rule "Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her"? There is; for in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5:31, 32), where Jesus describes the striking contrast between His mission and that of Moses, He speaks of divorce and says: "It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement. But I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery." This is not an isolated utterance; for the Savior repeats it in the fuller account of His questioning by the Pharisees, where He reasserts: "And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery" (Matt. 19:9). No argumentation, no juggling of the text, no recourse to the manuscripts, can change this plain statement: marital unfaithfulness breaks the marriage relation and may be cited by the innocent party as a reason for a divorce which God and the Church recognize.

While adultery is the only cause for divorce admitted by the Word of God, another provision is associated with this discussion. In 1 Cor. 7:15 St. Paul states pointedly: "If the unbelieving depart, let him depart; a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases." Applying this apostolic principle to our modern marriages, it becomes apparent that, when an unfaithful husband maliciously and permanently leaves his wife and will not return, this forsaking breaks the marriage relation. The deserted wife, according to the apostle's statement, "is not under bondage"; that is, she need no longer consider herself bound to her former husband and may have the courts declare this by granting a legal divorce, which the Church recognizes. This permission is not to be abused, nor are its provisions to be stretched so that they cover quarrels and misunderstandings in consequence of which the husband or wife leaves the home temporarily. The fact of wilful and absolute desertion with sinful intent must be established. When malicious forsaking is proved, it is interpreted by the Church as a breaking of the marriage relation and not merely a cause for which divorce may be secured before legal authority.

#### ANTI-SCRIPTURAL ATTITUDES

The State has not felt itself restricted by these statements of Scripture. As a result the nation has a crazy-quilt of marriage and divorce laws. A man may be a good citizen in one State and a bigamist in another. South Carolina recognizes no ground for divorce, while New Hampshire permits divorce for fourteen different causes. The Bureau of Census tells us in a bulletin on marriage and divorce that the reasons for which divorces are granted in our country are the following: 1) adultery, 2) cruelty, 3) de-sertion, 4) drunkenness, 5) neglect to provide, 6) gross neglect, 7) vagrancy, 8) conviction of crime, 9) separation, 10) bigamy, 11) incompatibility, 12) fraudulent representation, 13) misconduct, 14) other minor causes.

In reality, of course, these "other minor causes" throw open the floodgates for trivial allegations. In one of the largest ladies' journals in our country a flaunting advertisement shows a bride and groom standing before the altar and pledging themselves "till breath do us part." Below the picture the readers are asked: "Is the time coming when halitosis (unpleasant breath) will be a legal ground for separation? We hope not. There are too many grounds now. Yet halitosis has already been listed as an act of 'extreme cruelty.' In another case, tried in the Chicago courts, it was set forth as the principal cause of a woman's unhappiness with her husband."

Equally repulsive and anti-Scriptural are the reasons collected by the editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, who annually releases an assortment of divorce causes as recorded in public print. He mentions divorces granted: "to a Minneapolis woman because her husband's bridge partner struck her when he bid seven spades and found she did not hold the ace; to a Chicago man because his wife broke over his head a shaving mug which had been in the family three generations; to an Evanston woman because her husband dated the dust on the bathroom mirror with his finger; to a Memphis man because his wife 'married him for spite'; to a Bridgeport (Conn.) woman because her husband forced her to sleep in a hen-coop; to a Chesterfield (Mo.) man because his wife married him on a bet and forced him to do the family washing; to a Kansas City (Kans.) woman because her husband showered her with orchids and Paris gowns when she wanted to wear gingham and rear a family."

Advocating the extreme opposite, the Roman Catholic Church emphatically forbids divorce for any reason. In the encyclical of Pius XI, dated January 8, 1931, the Catholic doctrine is restated, declaring that marriage carries with it "a perpetual and indissoluble bond, which cannot be dissolved by civil law." Opposing the modern trend for easy divorce, this document states, "stands the unalterable Law of God, fully confirmed by Christ, a law which can never be deprived of its force by the decrees of men, the ideas of a people, or the will of any legislators: "What God hath joined together let not man put asunder." In conformity with this the Roman Church has persistently refused to grant divorce for any reason. It does not recognize divorces acknowledged by other churches or by the law.

This position, of course, ignores and rejects the definite exceptions made by our Savior in the two distinct places, Matt. 5:31 and Matt. 19:9. It is the custom of Roman Catholic scholars, as also of many Episcopal interpreters, to assert that the qualifying remark in these two passages which permits divorce on account of fornication is a later addition to the New Testament text and not an integral part of the original revelation. This stand is unwarranted, and opens the door to other wilful emendations of the text.

#### THE ANNULMENT ORGY

The difficulties into which the rejection of these plain Scriptural statements plunges the Catholic opposition to divorce may be seen in the subterfuges offered by the papal Rota. This court of Catholic appeal, consisting of twelve auditors and a presiding dean, issues decrees of ecclesiastic annulments and dispensations for remarriage. Some of these are fundamentally immoral and are mere substitutes for divorce. That they are so regarded may be seen in the statements of this candid cable dispatch from Paris to the New York World, dated August 5, 1923: "The divorce wave that is sweeping Europe, especially Paris, has even affected Catholics. Their religion forbids divorce, but many are obtaining declarations that their marriages never were valid because of canonically invalidating impediments. This is commonly called 'annulment.' So many have done this that the ecclesiastical court calendars at Rome have become clogged and Pope Pius has warned Cardinal Dubois here that new, more stringent restrictions will be made."

The case of the Duke of Marlborough and the former Consuelo Vanderbilt is illuminating. Both Episcopalians, they were married in St. Thomas's Church, New York, in 1895. For twenty-five years they lived together, and two children were born to them. The duchess obtained a divorce from her husband in 1920, and both married other persons. Desirous of becoming a member of the Catholic Church, the Duke went to Rome to have the first marriage annulled, claiming that this union was the result of duress. The Holy Rota Tribunal of the Vatican heard the case and substantiated a previous judgment of the Roman Church's diocesan court of Southwick, England, which had declared the first marriage null and void from the beginning. This decree in effect says that the Duke of Marlborough and his wife lived together for a quarter of a century not as husband and wife but in illegitimate union; it implies that the Rota Romana can break any nuptual pledge if it sees fit and that marriage contracts of Protestants need not be recognized. The protest of Bishop Manning, denouncing this annulment of a union contract thirty-one years after it had been made, will be supported by every unbiased American citizen: "The tribunal of the Rota at the Vatican, described as the supreme court in such matters, presumes to declare that an American marriage, valid, duly solemnized and recorded under our law, is void and that it never existed. This assumption of jurisdiction by a Vatican court has most serious implications and will be rightly resented by great numbers of our people. Our religious liberty in this country must be uncompromisingly defended against any such interference. This incident is a sharp reminder to those who love freedom of the importance of maintaining complete separation of Church and State. If marriages are to be declared null and void on pleas so unreal as this, no marriage and no home can be regarded as safe."

If this were an isolated incident, it might be explained as an unintentional error of the Rota, which according to its dean, Monsignor Massini, "must continue to listen to the requests also of non-Catholics because the Catholic Church is the mother of all souls redeemed by the precious blood of Christ" and which, on the same authority, "must be immaculate" (New York Times, October 2, 1927). But the Rota records contain other glaring incon-sistencies. Emma Eames, opera singer, was married to Julian Story; and Emelio De Gogorza, famous baritone, was married to a Jewess, Eliza Neumann, the ceremony having been performed by a New York magistrate. Later Miss Eames and De Gogorza, tiring of their marital bonds, wished to marry each other. Appeal was made to the Roman authorities, who declared that, since Mr. Story, the husband of Miss Eames, was not a Catholic, in the eyes of the Church they had not truly been married. Therefore, since De Go-gorza's wedding was a police-court ceremony, it was not recognized by the Church, and both of these marriages could be annulled when Miss Eames became a Catholic and married De Gogorza.

Quite parallel was the marital freedom extended to Marconi by "the Church that never divorces." A special copyright cable to the Chicago Daily News, November 24, 1926, featured this incredible report: "Senator Guglielmo Marconi, the radio inventor, is seeking ecclesiastical annulment of his marriage, it has been dis-closed, in connection with his audience with the Pope. Senator Marconi married the Honorable Beatrice O'Brien, daughter of the fourteenth Baron Inchiquin, in 1905 and was divorced from her in the civil courts a few years ago. Although both are Protestants, application was made recently to the Catholic curia of Westminster for annulment of marriage on the ground of defective legality. The annulment was provisionally granted. It is reported Senator Marconi desires to marry a woman in Rome whose name has not been disclosed. This would explain his desire to obtain an annulment of his former marriage, though he is a Protestant The technical reason for annulment of the marriage by the curia of Westminster was a condition agreed upon by the bridegroom at the insistence of the bride. This agreement was to the effect that the marriage should be dissolved if the couple were unable to agree."

When Mme. Maria Jeritza, opera singer, had to face the charge of her Austrian fellow-countrymen that her marriage to an American motion-picture director was "irregular," she answered pointedly: "I received the Catholic Church's approval of my second marriage. Born a Catholic, I became a Protestant to marry Baron Popper in Vienna in 1929 at a Protestant ceremony. That was ended by my Arkansas divorce, but I am still an Austrian citizen under the new Austrian law, and my Protestant marriage to the baron does not count. I returned to the Catholic Church to marry Mr. Sheehan, and competent church authorities assured me that all was regular."

These annulments may not justify the editorial comment that "marriage standards in Rome and Soviet Russia appear to be approaching a common plane"; but at least they show that the Roman doctrines of marriage are characterized by extreme flexibility. While this Church repudiates divorce, it just as insistently grants annulments, even under the most amazing circumstances.

In general it may be said that declarations of nullity are recognized by that Church, as Lynch (This Is Christian Marriage, p. 142 ff.) shows, when the prescribed Roman Catholic form of marriage is not observed; or when bride and groom were married against their will; or when they are married with conditions which that Church does not recognize; or finally, when the contracting parties were not free to marry, i.e., when they were within the forbidden degrees. In such cases Catholic or non-Catholics can appeal to the prescribed ecclesiastical authorities and finally even to the Rota for a declaration of nullity. This procedure means ultimately that all marriages performed by civil officiants or by non-Catholic clergymen may be declared altogether void (Lynch, l.c., p. 146) and that the parties to these annulled marriages are free to marry again.

The Scriptures make no specific provision for annulment; but the churches recognize all those nullifying legal procedures which are based on evident fraud or intimidation. It should be observed that annulments usually deal with premarriage conditions, while divorce concerns postmarriage reasons. For instance, when actual coercion has been employed in a ceremony performed at the point of a gun, when the evidence of concealed bigamy is shown, or when the marriage has united two who are within the forbidden degrees of relationship, these are not lawful, binding unions and may be revoked. This does not mean, however, that there can be any endorsement for the present wave of annulment, in which technical-ities, many of them premeditated, are seized upon months after the wedding to show the illegal nature of the ceremony. While the State has repeatedly granted annulments on the basis of age misrepresentation, the Church may not feel bound to recognize these revocations, particularly when they are palpably collusive attempts to break unpleasant marriage bonds. Judge Frank McDonough, Sr., of Denver protests against the many annulments following in the wake of gin marriages. Answering the petition of a Colorado young man twenty-one years old who claimed that he was too much intoxicated to know what he was doing when he married, Judge McDonough sounded a warning note: "If people voluntarily enter into a state of intoxication-and then in a careless manner go through a marriage ceremony, I just wonder if the law shouldn't leave them where they put themselves. Every time you dissolve a marriage of this type, you only encourage other people to go and do likewise." (New York Times, October 4, 1935.) However justifiable the grounds for annulment may be in such cases, once these are definitely known, the relationship of husband and wife must immediately cease if there is to be any legal nullification. Continued living together after the evidence of fraud or coercion precludes any possibility for later action.

#### REMARRIAGE AFTER DIVORCE

A disturbing consequence of divorce has come into undeserved prominence. It is the multiple weddings of those who flippantly discard their husbands or wives to take a second chance or, in this age of extremes, even third or fourth chances. Our files not only reveal head-line after head-line recounting the divorce orgies of players on the stage and screen, but they also show a steadily rising tide of repeated marriages, well styled "progressive polygamy," among those in less intensely publicized walks of life. Some of these notorious contemporaries are not far at least from the spirit of the domestic debauches by Hassan Ibn Ali, the grandson of Mohammed, who rejoiced in the sobriquet "the Divorcer." The Persian Mirat-ul-Kainat summarizes his marital adventures thus: "During his father's lifetime he successively married ninety or one hundred ladies, and notwithstanding his extreme good nature divorced again, for trifling reasons, every one he had taken."

The Church's position on remarriage is definite. If a divorce has been granted because of fornication or on the basis of actual malicious desertion, the innocent party may enter a new marriage. The Church will of course try to secure a reconciliation, and in many cases the Christian husband or wife suffering from unfaithfulness and disloyalty is ready to forgive and refuses to take recourse to divorce. When children are involved, their good name makes a reconciliation highly advisable. But if in these cases the outraged party insists on a divorce, this must be granted and with it the privilege of remarriage. 1 Cor. 7:15 states that the deserted spouse "is not under bondage." The marriage tie is broken. The innocent husband or wive may remarry. And the words of Jesus in Matt. 19:9, "I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another committeth adultery," imply that if a man puts his wife away for fornication and then marries another, no condemnation attaches to his actions if he, as the innocent party, remarries.

On the guilty husband or wife (in divorces granted for adultery) certain restrictions are imposed for remarriage. Because the adulterous husband is still bound to his wife, if she will have him, he cannot, so the Scriptures imply, marry any one else as long as she is alive, not remarried, and willing to live with him again. If the innocent wife marries some one else, she has definitely shown her un-willingness, and the guilty spouse may remarry. If she dies, the erring husband is, of course, free. In other words, as long as the innocent party is unmarried and the possibility of reconciliation remains, a Christian pastor should not perform the remarriage of the guilty party.

In 1 Cor. 7:10, 11 the apostle speaks of malicious desertion and says: "Let not the wife depart from her husband. But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her hus-band." Here St. Paul first of all forbids this wicked forsaking and then declares that those who desert their husbands cannot marry some one else. They must "remain unmarried," although the apostle hopes that they will "be reconciled" to their husbands. Thus in the case of malicious desertion, too, the Church will not remarry the deserting party as long as the innocent spouse is alive and unmarried, and there is a possibility of reacceptance of the offender.

In the instance of church-members who have been divorced by a civil decree which the Scriptures do not recognize the Church takes a firm position in regard to their remarriage. In Matt. 5:32 the Savior, preaching on the mount, declares that "whosoever shall marry her that is divorced" (that is, divorced, as the preceding words show, without Scriptural sanction) "committeth adultery.' And in Matt. 19:9 Jesus asserts: "Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another com-mitteth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery." A concrete instance will help to illustrate these passages. For example, if a man and a woman are divorced by prearrangement and collusion, simply because they do not care to live with each other, they have first of all broken the marriage vow. If either one remarries or both of them, they have committed adultery, and those with whom they are living in this new relationship have also committed adultery. These individuals may have been legally divorced and legally remarried, they may live as husband and wife in the eyes of the law; but in the eyes of the Church they have broken the Sixth Commandment and are living in an illicit relation. They cannot be retained in church-membership if they persist in maintaining these objectionable relations. They must express their true repentance and normally show this by their willingness to dissolve the adulterous union.

In these questions of remarriage many complicated situations may arise. These intricate problem cases should be carefully examined and judged according to the statements of God's Word.

Legal loopholes in our divorce legislation make remarriage possible in practically all cases where the guilty party has money or influence; but no social or financial prestige can purchase exemptions from the demands of God's Law. The willingness of many clergymen to officiate at socially important marriages involving guilty husbands or wives has helped to increase the notorious multiple marriage careers and unfairly heaped disgrace on the Church as a whole.

Until American churches sternly set their face against this slump in ecclesiastical morals and many sectarian clergymen refuse to officiate at the nuptials of these multiple-chancers in marriage, there can be no successful check on indiscriminate divorce and re-marriage. Never before have the leaders of American Christendom been under more serious obligation to proclaim the indissolubility of the marriage vow, to restrict divorce to infidelity and malicious desertion; and never before has outward Christianity so dismally failed in a crisis.

These concise Scriptural regulations will find no sympathetic response among young people who view marriage as a chance or at best as a problematical uncertainty. They tell us that it is immoral to bind two people together when they realize that their affections have been misplaced or when love dies. They picture divorce as a remedy, caustic but necessary, for unhappy marriages. They glorify the new freedom and in the same breath charge the Church with strait-laced tyranny and indifference to the happiness of its members.

This is a libel upon the solicitous interest with which the Church regards the ultimate welfare of its children. When pointed but usually hypothetical questions are raised, asking whether the Church sentences to lifelong punishment the wives who have suffered from the brutality of inhuman husbands, we have always replied that, when the aggravation is so serious that a Christian wife cannot live with her unbelieving husband without suffering physical harm, endangering her life, being compelled to deny her Savior or suffering intolerable indignities, there may be, first of all, a temporary separation. This is not divorce; for both parties remain married and are not free to contract new alliances. Nor should such separation be adopted except as a last expedient, just as it should be terminated as soon as the provocative conditions have been removed, for example, as soon as a husband shows that he will not harm his wife. The Church does not give a carte-blanche recommendation of such separations; for too often they are merely impulsive selfish actions, and frequently they may be the prelude to a divorce which the Church cannot recognize.

Under given conditions the Church has held that, if separation proves futile and a drunken sot, for example, persists in beating his helpless wife and threatening her life, this brutality may produce a condition tantamount to malicious desertion.

#### COMPANIONATE MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE

Notable for its advocacy of quick and easy divorce has been the agitation in recent years for companionate marriage.

This is a very definite theory. Its former high priest, Judge Benjamin Barr Lindsey, gives us this definition: "Companionate marriage is legal marriage, with legalized birth control and with the right to divorce by mutual consent for childless couples, without payment of alimony." (The Companionate Marriage, p. V.) Three factors are essential to its program: the dissemination of birth-control information, the establishment of divorce commissions, and the elimination or regulation of alimony payments. This program has been reduced to a series of legal proposals described by Mr. Lindsey in this synopsis: "Here is a brief outline of the three essential legislative enactments or bills I have in mind:

"1) A bill for an act to repeal the present stupid laws against birth-control clinics to carry on and give advice to married women, who might make use of the information or not, as they choose, leaving it to their personal judgment as to whether they should remain childless or not, and if so, how long. . ..

"2) A second bill to amend the laws relating to divorce. This bill would add a clause providing that, where couples are childless and where the efforts of the magistrate to bring about a reconcile-ment have failed and where the couple mutually desires a divorce, the divorce shall be granted without further expense or needless delay.' This would require no lawyer, no more than getting married requires a lawyer. A judge can marry people and by this law he could under the prescribed conditions unmarry them.

"3) A third bill to regulate the property status of the divorced. It would deal with the right of the wife to support and alimony. It would withhold or grant such support and alimony according to the conditions of the case. For instance, if a woman were in good health and able to work and to support herself, there would ordinarily be no alimony. — Such a bill might provide that the property rights of childless couples should, at the discretion of the court, ordinarily be the same as the property rights of single per-sons." (L. c., pp. 245, 246.)

In the final analysis little fundamental difference can be found between the companionate marriage and the trial marriage. However strenuous may be the protest against this identification, it is admitted that the two have certain features in common (I.c., p. VI) : "Both would normally avail themselves of birth control and divorce by mutual consent. Both would place a minimum of obstruction in the way of childless couples wishing a divorce. And both recognize the fact that, when men and women marry, they can never be perfectly certain that their marriage will turn out to be a permanent success." The distinction Lindsey makes between the two is that, while a trial marriage emphasizes the trial element and establishes the psychology of impermanence, the companionate marriage differs in the adjective and more strongly emphasizes the desirability of permanence, although always conceding a line of retreat.

Positive blessings, it is asserted, will result from this easy divorce. Companionate marriage, we are told, entirely removes the tragedies of loveless unions; for when both husband and wife realize that they are not compatible on several scores, the companionate relation may be ended by mutual consent without cumbersome formalities and prohibitive expenses. The couple simply appears before a special domestic-relations judge, and if he is unable to convince them of the advisability of staying together, the divorce follows, with the participants free to seek new fields of marital adventure.

This plan starts from the wrong principle. The bitterness of loveless marriage is to be averted before the wedding and not after. The days of courtship should form the trying and testing period when two young people become well acquainted. The procedure of the companionate theory would prove absurd in the ordinary affairs of every-day life, where no one is admitted to a responsible position without having presented credentials as to ability. Why, then, in the incomparably more personal issue of marriage should young people be told, in effect, that they can decide after the wedding whether they are well mated, and if not, that their relationship can easily be broken by recourse to a companionate divorce?

Volubly do the companionists assert that their mode of marriage is more honorable and less deceitful and that for this reason it will destroy the double standard in marriage, with one procedure open to the wealthy and the same legal loophole closed to the poor. Mr. Lindsey emphasizes this in the third paragraph of his preface: "My thought is that we should put an end to this hypocritical pretense under which we profess one thing and do another, that the companionate marriage, now largely monopolized by educated people who understand scientific contraception and who can employ skilled lawyers in the obtaining of collusive divorces, ought to be made legally and openly available to all people, particularly to the poor and socially unfit, who need it most."

All this is further evidence of twisted morality. Instead of thundering out their denunciation against prearranged divorce and birth control, particularly among cultured families, champions of companionism first condone these obnoxious evils and then insist that the poor and uneducated are entitled to employ the same sordid methods. If anything smacks of hypocrisy and collusion, it is this idea of entering a marriage relation, supposedly a permanent union, but which, as both participants well know, may be dissolved at the slightest mutual inclination.

The advocates of this companionate relation do not minimize the conflict between their claims and the demands of the Bible. Mr. Lindsey gives a good example of intellectual honesty to many modernist preachers when he admits: "I have been receiving a good many letters of late asking me how I reconcile some of the views I am expressing in this book with the Bible. I have one short and conclusive answer to that question. I don't reconcile it with the Bible. Moreover, I don't see why I should. Those of my views which are in accord with Holy Writ speak for themselves. Those which are not have to be classed with evolution, the roundness of the earth, and other matters which were not factors in the speculative thought of the ancient Jews. To say that modern sociology must deal with modern facts is not to flout or discount the Bible. It is to interpret that book in the corrective light of changing conditions." (L. c., p. 323.)

For the Christian this admission invalidates the entire theory. The Bible condemns birth control as popularly understood; companionate marriage endorses it. The Bible denounces divorce and restricts its occurrence; companionate marriage champions divorce and advocates recourse to its emancipation. The Bible upholds the lifelong union of one man and one woman through sunshine and sorrow as God's ideal; companionate marriage offers a series of temporary unions, "until convenience do you part." As every plan that violates God's institution cultivates dangerous trends, so the spread of the companionate-marriage idea will promote debacle. It degrades marriage, breaks down the sanctity of the home, legalizes the violations of the marriage union, minimizes or destroys the blessings of family life, and grips our national wellbeing in a stranglehold.

The last argument in the Church's case against companionism finds in this overriding of marriage institutions only the first step in a program of revolt. After The Companionate Marriage's 395 pages of gratuitous vulgarity and innuendo the yellow journalistic style of Lindsey's collaborator, Wainwright Evans, comes to a significant climax on the last page. Lindsey admits that what he demands is but a minimum, and he concludes: "I am not asking much. These are the foot-hills of achievement. Beyond lie the mountains." The thoughtful reader asks: "What mountains?" If easy, quick, and repeated divorce, indoctrinated birth control, degradation of wifehood, — if these be but the foot-hills, can the mountains be anything else than the heights of free love, unmarried unions, and the debauch of animal lust?

Like other fads, this has run its course, and after a decade the agitation for its enactment is silently slipping away. How-ever, we cannot eliminate the discussion of companionism under the claim that it is outmoded after a few years of spectacular notoriety. While campaigning for election to the Superior Court of California, Lindsey was confronted by opposing slogans that appealed: "Defeat Lindsey and free love!" Probably more than political prudence directed him to declare: "Companionate marriage is a dead issue, which I dislike discussing since it has been thoroughly misunderstood and is apparently unexplainable." (Time Letters Supplement, July 23, 1934.) For certainly there is a genuine ring in the statement he issued almost a year later (March 18, 1935), declaring: "I am supposed to be an advanced thinker in this field, but nevertheless I am for a good old-fashioned marriage until death do us part. The problem is to get it that way. I believe our grandparents were happier and spiritually more successful than we are."

Yet while the support has subsided, the theory lingers, because companionism, regardless of the name it may assume, is endorsed by growing numbers. Judge Lindsey declares: "Companionate marriage is already an established social fact in this country. It is conventionally respectable. Sophisticated people are, without incurring social reproach, everywhere practicing birth control and are also obtaining collusive divorce, outside the law, whenever they want it. They will continue to practice, and no amount of prohibitive legislation can stop them." (The Companionate Marriage, p. V.)

#### ANTIDOTES TO DIVORCE

The reduction of the divorce rate has been the object of prolonged concern. Even those not moved by religious convictions recognize this sabotage of American morals and have sought effective remedies. These cures have frequently stressed the physical side and found the cause for divorce in such evidently remote defects as flat feet. Others have taken the psychological approach and have featured away-from-the-husband or away-from-the-wife vacations, moratoria on family meals, the maintenance of separate residences, and similar arrangements designed to provide regular furloughs from married life and prevent monotony. At the same time much counsel for the more practical issues of married life has been published in late years.

In keeping with the social-study trends of our day, however, the fundamental, character-building contributions of true Christianity and the emphasis on Scriptural marriage ideals have been ignored. Yet these principles offer the only powerful antidote to the divorce orgy. Christians know that divorce, far from being a convenient exit from the consequences of faulty judgment, is a heinous crime in the sight of their God and in its effects upon their fellow-men. Instead of minimizing the necessity of painstaking care in the choice of a life companion, they, believing that for God's children marriages are made in heaven, still should be guided by intelligent selection. They refuse to risk the happiness of a lifetime on the impulses of a fortnight's courtship. They deny that true love is blind.

When these high-souled ideals are supplemented by a married life in which spiritual claims are not disregarded, the possibilities of permanent misunderstanding are remote. If Christ rules, divorce remains a distant, ugly Caliban. Judge John Rooney of the Chicago Court of Domestic Relations has stated "that three out of four domestic troubles that have come before him have been the result of the neglect of either husband or wife or both to attend any church services." It has been shown that most Christians stay away from divorce tribunals. They are guided by the spirit of Christian forbearance, the willingness to sacrifice, and the readiness to find the best possible interpretation for all actions. They have the comradeship of their Savior, the direction of His Word, the strength of prayet, and the support of the Sacraments.

Convincing evidence of Christian faith and life as a divorce antidote is found in John A. Goodwin's The Pilgrim Republic (p. 596.) Here the following divorces are listed:

1661 Elizabeth Burge was divorced from Thomas, Jr., on Scriptural grounds.
1668 William Tubbs, of Scituate, was granted a divorce from Mercy Sprague, she having eloped trom the colony.
1663 Ensign John Williams of Barnstable was fined ten pounds for slandering his wife, Sarah, and John Bayley; but ten years later was granted a divorce on Scriptural grounds.
1675 Edward Jenkins of Taunton petitioned that his daughter Mary be divorced from Marmaduke Atkinson, who had been out of the colony for seven years. The decision was a singular one, namely, that, while the court "sees no cause to grant a divorce, yet they do apprehend her to be no longer bound, but do leave her to her liberty to marry if she please."
1680 Elizabeth Wade was regularly divorced from Thomas Stevens for his bigamy.
1686 John Glover of Barnstable was divorced from Mary for Scriptural cause.

Goodwin then concludes: "These six cases include all the divorces granted during the Colony's existence." Between 1620 and 1691 the Plymouth Colony, with a population that grew into the thou-sands, recorded only these divorces, each one granted on grounds of patent immorality or desertion. The sturdy Christian character of these pioneers expressed itself in firm family ties.

If the dynamics of Christian faith, coupled with the same kind of common sense and caution exerted otherwise in important contract obligations, were applied before and after the ceremony, the vast majority of divorces would never occur. The residue, caused by that cropping out of human nature which persists despite all scientific advancement, could be dealt with in an effective and stigmatizing manner.

## ELEMENTS OF WEDDED HAPPINESS

### "...AND OBEY"

Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the Church. - Eph. 5:25

What is the outstanding advance achieved in our much-heralded century of progress?

If the readers were called upon to designate the most phenomenal change in the past hundred years, their verdicts would betray many contradictory opinions. The commercial adaptation of electricity; the radio, telephone, and telegraph; the automobile, airplane, and submarine; X-rays, ultra- and infraspectrum rays and photography; the achievements of archeology in the Old and the New World, - these are but a few items in the long catalog of twentieth-century distinctions that straightway suggest themselves. Mechanically trained minds can enumerate a host of innovations that have fairly revolutionized American industry during the last decades. Professional men and women point to the lengthening strides of progress in medicine and surgery, in education and peda-gogy, even in the externals of law and church-work. Business leaders and industrial experts recite a ponderous series of fundamental improvements by which efficiency of production and methods of distribution have leaped with amazing bounds beyond the outmoded methods of nineteenth-century conservatism.

Yet I firmly believe that many of these astonishing evidences of progress assume only secondary importance when compared with the epoch-making change which subsequent history will designate as one of the most notable advances during the last one hundred years: the heights of prominence toward which womanhood has slowly, but steadily, climbed.

#### THE FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS

Only about a century ago, in 1833, the first American college opened its doors to women students when Oberlin in Ohio established its "Female Department," dedicated to "the elevation of female character by bringing within the reach of the misguided and neglected sex all the instruction privileges which have hitherto unreasonably distinguished the leading sex from theirs." In the same year, in Jacksonville, Illinois, the first permanent women's club in our country was organized. Before 1833 drew to its close, the first women's organization with a political objective, the Philadelphia Female Antislavery Society, had its inception. Because these significant tendencies crystallized about a hundred years ago, and because an economic revolution, particularly in the young textile industry of New England, at that time took women out of the seclusion of the home, we speak, as Inez Haynes Irwin does in her book Angels and Amazons, of a "hundred years of American women."

The consideration now accorded the American woman as well as her entrée into practically all branches of human activity was not easily won. In 1840, at the world's Antislavery Conference in London, the fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who had been scheduled to speak before a vast audience, walked out in protest when the conference ruled that women delegates could take no part in the discussion but should remain modestly concealed behind the gallery screen, where they could listen, unseen, to the palaver of the men.

It was only in 1848 that young women were able to prepare for a professional career. In that year the first American institution for professional studies enrolled women students. Their alma mater was the Female Medical College in Boston, a school which specialized in scientific midwifery. During the same year Harriet Martineau, English authoress, came to the United States and found that women were admitted to but seven vocations: sewing, domestic service, tailoring, teaching school, music, nursing, and millinery.

In his issue of December, 1859, the editor of the North lowan Times relieved himself of this tall-corn philippic against emancipated girls who started "to unsex themselves" — by skating:

"There is much talked and written about this new exercise of women's rights. A plate in Harper's Holiday Pictorial will cure most ladies of all desire to learn the sublime art of converting their pedal extremities into sled runners.

"A handsome girl with her outer garments well tucked up and under limbs more than half exhibited, her delicate footsies shod with iron a la horse, shoving herself, one side at a time, ovér the glassy surface of the frozen lake... must be a picture which the imagination would long retain.

"Skating is healthy; so are hunting, fishing, and ball-playing. But the profits of exercise can be obtained by walking; and if that were practiced more, there would be no necessity for girls to unsex themselves for the amusement of the crowd. When girls take to ice, they stand on slippery places. Let female skating therefore be abolished!"

With all these setbacks and delays American women of the last generations have succeeded in the discriminations against their sex. An analysis of women's present-day economic activities tabulated in Occupation Statistics, a report of the fifteenth census, reveals arresting facts. In 1930 more than 1,886,000 women were employed as operatives in manufacturing and mechanical industries. About 2,000,000 women held clerical positions. Approximately 1,526,200 were engaged in the professions, including 870,000 teachers, 8,388 physicians, surgeons, and osteopaths, 20,131 college professors and presidents, 3,385 attorneys, and 3,276 woman clergymen.

We shall not now discuss this nation-wide exodus from the home; and indeed no good purpose is served in the attempt, however well meant, to lash seas moved by the irresistible ebb and flow of economic tides. We survey the seething masses of America's working-women as they daily rub elbows with cold competitive forces of modern business; and we may sigh for the home-centered life which would reemphasize the family as a productive unit and restore large numbers of our American young women to the sheltering protection of their homes. But all the sighs and fears will never take the American girl from the office, the factory, the pro-fessions, and bring her back to the yesteryear, when the well-bred young woman, disdainfully rejecting the very suggestion of manual labor or remunerative employment, often spent the greater part of a dilettante day in perusing the sententious literature of a crinoline age. Those days have passed forever. No one exults more in their passing than the keen-minded Christian young woman, happy in working, planning, achieving. Now that the discriminations which penalized womanhood have largely been removed, few can review the rising status of womanhood in this century of social progress without agreeing that here we have one of the most noteworthy preeminences of our age.

#### THE FLARES OF FEMINISM

However, a consequence of womanhood's emergence from discrimination is that rabid, overbalanced emphasis on women's rights which, while claiming the privilege of parity with men, actually demands absolute independence. Largely through the efforts of such leaders as Mary Wollstonecraft, Annie Besant, Lucy Stone, Charlotte Gillman, Olive Schreiner, Ellen Key, Susan Anthony, Christabel Pankhurst, and through the allied support of writers like Mills, Ibsen, Shaw, an international crusade for sex equality was inaugurated, with this watchword emblazoned on its standards: "We mean to set women free" (Annie Besant, The Political Status of Women, p. 16). The factors of this freedom are frankly stated by Elizabeth S. Chesser in Woman, Marriage, and Motherhood (p. 275): "Women are striving for economic, legal, and sexual independence."

The marriage program of these militant feminists and their socialist cohorts is hostile to the Christian code. The ideal union, says this radical platform, is the marriage of two friends who are but the companions of pleasure. Since friendship is never exclusive and not necessarily permanent, husbands and wives must be free to maintain several friendships, to form new associations, and to refuse to have these connections impeded by children. Jane Alcott, ardent feminist, voices these sentiments in the New York Times: "A man or woman should be free to give love whenever it is natural. Love is volatile; and when it goes, I believe it is unmoral for man and wife even to appear to live together except for the sake of their children. In that case each should be free to bestow love elsewhere by mutual agreement."

These sentiments ally feminism with easy divorce and its consequent degeneracy. Mrs. Beatrice Hale (What Women Want, p. 267) candidly admits: "Feminists believe in divorce." They find, in the words of one of their clerical supporters, marriage too holy to be restricted by promise. "Until death you do part" is interpreted as a survival of serfdom.

Feminist leaders have even counseled wives to retain their maiden names. When Lucy Stone married Henry B. Blackwell, she inaugurated this practice; and the Lucy Stone League, an organization of like-minded women, has followed her example. Others have demanded that the wife retain her title "Miss" after marriage, abandoning the "Mrs." as an outworn discrimination.

To emphasize their equality with man, feminists insist that women must have a right to woo, even as a man enjoys the privileges of courtship. In conformity with the perversions practiced among some degenerate heathen, extreme feminists have demanded that the wife companion select her own husband companion. Most of us, however, appreciate Harriet Beecher Stowe's allusion to "the disgust which man feels when she whom God made to be sought degrades herself to seek." (Pink and White Tyranny, p. 269.)

Economic equality is another of the planks in the feminist plat-form. Ellen Key declares: "Only when the duty of support on the part of man ceases, will woman be able to demand the same chastity and fidelity from him as he demands of her." (The Woman Movement, p. 148.)

Even in matters of dress and conduct, in recreation and amusement, a sweeping equality is to prevail. In 1850 Helen Marie Weber, appearing at the Worcester (England) convention, prophesied that "in ten years' time male attire will be generally worn by the women of most civilized countries and that it will precede the consummation of many great measures which are deemed to be of paramount importance" (Proceedings, p. 78). Her enthusiasm overbid itself, although Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, the first woman to receive a medal of honor from Congress, affected male attire. Her penchant for men's clothes at first provoked discourtesy. Fortified by a Congressional sanction, Dr. Walker clung persistently to her unconventional frock coat, trousers, and high hat until her death in 1919, although this male attire never permitted her to forget for a moment that she wished to be treated as a lady. At one occasion, in a Capitol elevator, she snatched a cigar from the mouth of a male fellow-passenger and demanded: "Have you no more respect than to smoke in the presence of a lady?" The deliberate reply was to the point: "If you want the respect due a lady, you should dress like one, and maybe you will get it then."

If children come (although feminism is allied with artificial birth control), the radical champions of women's rights insist that the mothers be the guardians of their offspring. Laura Aberconway, The Nation (London), May 31, 1931, complains that "man is the only animal who denies to the mother the supreme control of the young." It is but a step from this exaggeration to the further insistence upon a modern matriarchy, the female domination of the home.

#### THE ANTI-"OBEY" CAMPAIGN

Closely related is the indignant agitation for the removal of "obey" from the bride's marriage pledge. This movement has always been championed by ardent feminists. The Rev. Miss Anna Howard Shaw, suffragist leader, claimed that in her opinion it was "positively wicked to use this word [obey] in the marriage contract."

Recent efforts to ban the wifely obedience have originated within churches, and in several instances this agitation has been successful. Thus, in the revisions of the Prayer-Book of the Church of England, the Episcopal bishops have eliminated the debated term. No longer, according to the new version, will the bride alone promise "to love, cherish, and obey." Instead, her pledge will be made in unison with that of her husband; both promise "to love, cherish, and serve."

Miss A. Maude Royden, president of the League of the Church Militant of England, insists that the requirements of modern wedding vows are obsolete and hurls this denunciation against the "obey" pledge: "The marriage service in its.present form compels both the bride and bridegroom to take words on their lips which are not true. It is appalling to take a vow which she has no intention of keeping.... Taking out the promise to obey would raise the ideal of matrimony among the ignorant."

In our own country liberal church-bodies, like Dr. Charles Francis Potter's Humanist Society in New York, have adopted similar actions; and the question has been repeatedly aired before some of the more conservative church-bodies. In interviews with prominent St. Louis pastors of Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist, Unitarian, Baptist, Congregational, Jewish, Evangelical, and Catholic congregations it was found that not one used the word "obey" in his marriage service. Many emphasized that they purposely avoided the antagonizing word.

#### "THE HUSBAND IS THE HEAD OF THE WIFE"

Now, the employment of the term "obey" is in itself a matter of only secondary importance. It'is far more imperative that there be a proper premarital understanding of the Biblical teaching in this question. As in other practical issues, the Scriptures speak clearly and finally. Here are some of its direct injunctions: "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord" (Eph. 5:22). "The husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the Head of the Church" (Eph. 5:23). "As the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every-thing" (Eph. 5:24). "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord" (Col. 3:18). These and other ordinances are New Testament reassertions of the fundamental rule instituted to establish the position of wifehood and womanhood for all lands and ages: "Unto the woman He said, ... Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee" (Gen. 3:16).

It must be evident from these passages that according to divine will the family, instead of having two heads, is to have one, the husband, to whom both God and man look for the direction of the domestic affairs. It is the husband who takes the initiative in establishing the union by his proposal for marriage; it is he who sustains it by his financial support; and it is he who must direct it according to Biblical requirements. The Scriptures are too definite to permit of any other interpretation; and when the ceremony asks the bride to pledge herself "to love, honor, and obey," this promise is in direct conformity with Heaven's ideal for the highest married happiness. It asks that the companionship of a helpful wife express itself in perpetual self-giving and find an exquisite joy even in the commonplace tasks. She will generously serve the interests of her husband by promoting his health and happiness, giving time and thought to the preparation of food, loving care to the neatness of the dwelling, and, in all, observing the preferences of her husband, even as the Church submits to Christ.

Charles Haddon Spurgeon, greatest of English pulpit orators, draws a charming picture of a Christian wife's devotion to her husband in lines that are said to be a veiled description of his wife, Susannah: "She delights in her husband, in his person, his character, his affection; to her he is not only the chief and foremost of mankind, but in her eyes he is all in all. Her heart's love belongs to him, and to him only. He is her little world, her Paradise, her choice treasure. She is glad to sink her individuality in his. She seeks no renown for herself; his honor is reflected upon her, and she rejoices in it. She will defend his name with her dying breath; safe enough is he where she can speak of him. His smiling gratitude is all the reward she seeks. Even in her dress she thinks of him and considers nothing beautiful which is distasteful to him. He has many objects in life, some of which she does not quite understand; but she believes in them all, and anything she can do to promote them she delights to perform. ... Such a wife, as a true spouse, realizes the model marriage relation and sets forth what our oneness with the Lord ought to be." (The Shadow of the Broad Brim, by Richard Ellsworth Day, p. 104.)

Even if a young woman makes the mistake of marrying an infidel husband, her allegiance to him in all things that do not restrict her Christian faith and life must be genuine. It is a remarkable blessing, repeatedly emphasized on the pages of church history, that the godly companionship of a Christian wife and her quiet, Christ-dedicated life have often achieved more than all other human factors combined in bringing an infidel husband into the faith.

Men recognize few spectacles more pathetic than that of a non-resisting husband who permits himself to be tyrannized by a dynamic wife. The last vestige of all sound happiness is sacrificed in those homes where shrewish women have not been tamed. The man who lives in perpetual apprehension of the disapproval which his wife may hurl upon an innocent pastime, the servile husband who answers the shrill and imperious summons of his wife with a docile "Yes, my deat," is an abject caricature of what people by common consent expect to find in a virile husband.

How often when an unusual opportunity for advancement is offered a young husband in another city, does his eagerness for promotion deflate itself as his wife petulantly insists that she will not leave with him! Unhappily he yields, and another promising career sinks into mediocrity. Or a husband with the endowment of hospitality wants to invite a group of congenial friends to spend a reminiscent evening with him; but an unmistakable nudge from his wife's sharp elbow seals the invitation behind silent lips. In a hundred ways men who toil and sweat for their families, from the depths of whose hearts comes an unrelieved yearning for happiness, find that their long-cultivated visions are but mirages on the desert of female dominion.

Because it is an evasion of divine order, the ascendency of female dominion may be an indication of national decline, particularly when we hear confident statements to the effect that before long a woman President will occupy our White House. We recall the prophetic voice of Isaiah raised in warning (chap. 3:12): "As for My people, women rule over them." Destruction, he predicted, would be the consequence. When Cato declared: "All men rule over women, we Romans rule over all men, and our wives rule over us," he did not exaggerate, although he may have been unaware that this rule by women would help spell the doom of Roman greatness.

Petticoat politics flourished at the time of the empire's greatest moral degeneracy and the collapse of Roman power closely followed this rejection of natural order, just as the French state collapsed when the frail fingers of the salonières, ambitious, ruth-less, scheming women of the decadent court, embroidered political designs, used their husbands as puppets, and tried to exercise the controlling voice in governmental affairs. Madame De Langeac could command lettres de cachet; Mademoiselle Renard could create officerships; Mademoiselle Guimard had it in her power to distribute benefices. Madame Geoffrin gave advice to a young man who asked her how to succeed: Make friends among women rather than among men; for through the women you can manage the men. (Emily Putnam, The Lady.) Dominated by these influences, the empire was doomed.

A happy marriage often dims the flare for feminism. The case of Margaret Fuller is illuminating. In her zeal for women's rights she proposed a female congress in Washington to compete with the regular male legislature; and without permitting herself to be restricted by false modesty, she offered to serve as the first female president. When she was thirty-seven years old, she married a poor Italian marquis whom a contemporary authority described as "the most beautiful man he had ever seen." The marriage changed the ardent feminist altogether. An American acquaintance who had known Margaret Fuller from her girlhood days wrote: "How unlike is she to the Margaret Fuller of the former days! The masculine intellectual gladiator ready to challenge all comers, is now so delicate, so simple, so confiding, so affectionate, with a true womanly heart and soul, and, what to me was a still greater surprise, possessed of so broad a charity that she could cover with its mantle the faults and defects of all about her!" (Some Queer People, by Ladbroke Black, p. 61 ff.)

#### HUSBANDLY HEADSHIP — HOW FAR?

The question immediately arises, How far does the headship and priority of the husband extend? It must be remembered right at the outset that it does not embrace any spiritual superiority. In the caste-effacing appeal of the Savior's Gospel there is, as St. Paul pauses to emphasize, "neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus" (Gal. 3:28).

This removal of the high barriers that had excluded woman from the full benefits of religion stands out in sharp relief when contrasted with non-Christian religions. Near the White Sea lives a dwindling clan of a mongrel race, the Samoyedes, who unconditionally prohibit all women not only from taking a part in their religious practices but also from expressing any belief or creed. Religion is not for women, they hold, and they carry through to a drastic extreme the principle, widely endorsed by pagan philosophies, that women are almost soulless creatures, hardly more than animals or slaves. This is a logical inference even from the doctrines of Mohammed's Koran. For in the paradise of Islam, which has no special place for mortal wives, the men will be enthralled by the presence of the houris, their supernatural companions.

It follows that the wife cannot obey her husband in any request which militates against the Word of God. The Scriptural statement "We ought to obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29) obligates Christian women to refuse all requests of their husbands that run counter to divine requirements. If a tyrannical husband tries to prevent his wife from attending church; if he prohibits the reading of the Bible and insists that the children shall not be baptized; if he dictates some action that would be dishonest or detrimental to her health or well-being, a Christian wife cannot obey him in these demands and is absolved from any consequences which this refusal may entail. Today, after fifteen centuries, we can still feel the force of this complaint made by a Christian woman against her heathen husband as it is preserved on an ancient and intimate papyrus: "Whereupon a marriage deed was made, and after this agreement and his oaths he again hid the keys from me; and when I had gone out to the church at Sambatho, he had the outside doors shut on me, saying, 'Why did you go to church?' and using many terms of abuse to my face and through his nose." (Egyptian Papyri and Papyrus Hunting, James Baikie, p. 294.)

Neither does the rule of the husband embrace the domineering direction of those matters in which the free decision of the wife should be respected. In civic life, for example, a husband cannot compel his wife to vote the Republican or the Democratic ticket. While it is to be expected that normally the political ideals of both will be directed to a common goal, it may sometimes be contrary to the conscience of the wife to accept her husband's party affiliation. Again, the husband who has no ear for music should not issue a lord-of-the-manor decree to prevent his wife from playing the piano; or a "swing" devotee should not insist that the family radio be continually tuned to bizarre blares and prohibit his wife from enjoying the type of music which appeals to her.

Nor can we tolerate one code of morals for the husband and another for the wife. By an unfair double standard a husband's indiscretion is often glossed over as a peccadillo, while the same sin is branded as a serious moral lapse when committed by the wife. This distinction is age-old, as the Code of Hammurabi shows.

Again, the headship of the husband does not deprive the wife of her legal status or minimize her rights at law. In a famous compendium of Mohammedan jurisprudence, Manhaj et Thalibin, written by Al Nawai and still used throughout the Islamic world, we meet the hopeless legal status of a Mohammedan woman. She can be divorced at the caprice of her husband. We are told, in casuistic seriousness: "Where a husband and wife eat together some dates and mix the seeds and the husband says to the wife, 'If you don't separate your seeds from mine, you are repudiated,' and the wife puts each seed aside, the condition of repudiation is not fulfilled, and the marriage remains intact, unless the husband wishes her to indicate which seeds are hers. When a woman has a date in her mouth and her husband repudiates her on condition that she swallows it and then changes his mind and makes it depend on her spitting it out and then changes his mind again and makes the repudiation depend on her taking the date in the hollow of her hand and the woman on hearing these words quickly swallows half the date and spits out the other half, the condition is not considered to be fulfilled." (Zwemer, Place of Woman in Islam, p. 202.)

Finally the male preeminence is not to be sought in social distinctions which degrade the wife to the level of virtual serfdom. That much-storied courtier of the Middle Ages the Knight of La Tour seeks to impress upon his daughters the servile obedience which a medieval wife owed her husband. One of his narratives features a wife who habitually contradicted her husband in the presence of strangers. His patience exhausted, he finally used his biceps to enforce his authority and broke her nose as he struck her to the ground. The Knight does not take the time to explain or excuse the husband's actions in marring her beauty. Some ancient tombstones in Rome mark the graves of women with muzzles to show that they were not to talk, and with reins to show that they were to be driven. In India, where the annual cost of maintaining some 14,000,000 sacred cattle is estimated at $80,000,000, the wife is accorded much less consideration than one of these pampered cows. She is not permitted to occupy the same quarters as her husband. Instead, Mother India's daughters live in the zenanas, usually so dirty and dismal that a native Indian protests: "I shudder to think about the condition of our mothers and sisters in the harem... From early morn till late at night they are working out the same routine throughout the whole of their lives without a murmur, as if they are patience incarnate. There are many instances where a woman has entered the house of her husband at the time of the marriage and did not leave it until death had carried her away. They are always in harness as if they have no will but only to suffer— suffer without any protest." (Abani Mohan Das Gupta, in K. Mayo's Mother India, p. 122.) Woman's social position in Moslem North Africa is graphically illustrated by this picture from The Moslem World of Today (J.R. Mott, p. 237): "A feast is being held in the stone hut, and the men sit shoulder to shoulder round the wide wooden footstool that serves for table; the bowl of semolina is crowned by a stewed fowl. From this the neck. and claws are thrown to the woman huddled in the corner. That is her legitimate portion. She has fed the chicken with her own scraps; she modeled the bowl with its quaint crisscross of orange and black and red colors pounded from stones that she knows. She has rolled and steamed grain for hours. So be it: she shall have the neck and the claws."

#### "EVEN AS CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH"

Christ's Gospel, supported by His own holy example, raises its voice for the new commandment of love to protest against man's barbarity toward woman. Even Renan, skeptic that he was, admits: "Woman never had a religious conscience, a moral individuality, or an opinion of her own previous to Christianity." According to the divine standard the Christian husband, far from condescending to bestow only casual affection upon his wife, must love her with that profound devotion demanded by the apostolic injunction: "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the Church" (Eph. 5:25). When at Calvary, all history's holy of holies, we pause to survey the extent of Christ's devotion to the Church, we bow before a love that came to give rather than to take, to serve instead of being served, a love that loved until the end, that bitter end when, in the greatest sacrifice of which even divine mercy could conceive, Christ died that His Church might live. By the impulse of this divine love the discussion of the term "obey" becomes more academic than actual in any truly Christian marriage. Glorifying Christ, the husband will be impelled to cherish his wife with an intense affection, to acknowledge her virtues and accomplishments, to minimize her frailties, to perform the many services of love by working for her, providing for her, living for her, and, if necessary, even dying for her, as Christ gave Himself for the Church. This includes of course the less heroic exhibitions of devotion - the daily evidence of love and comradeship expressed in words of endearment and in confidential exchanges of opinion.

Guided by these divine standards, Christian marriages normally develop into congenial lifetime alliances. That is why a young man who stands on the threshold of the matrimonial domain, instead of worrying about the rigid maintenance of his masculine prerogatives, should pray for the help of God so that by the indwelling of His Spirit he may love his wife "even as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself for it." There was more practical truth than exegetical accuracy in the observation of the old interpreters who taught that woman was not created from the head of man, to signify that she was not to rule over him; nor from his feet, to prevent the claim that she was to be a slave; but from his side, to symbolize that she was to be his helpmate and companion.

In St. Paul's time wifehood was degraded beyond the reaches of our modern conception. For this reason he continues to compare a husband's love for his wife with the love of Christ for the Church; he also established another standard to check the sin of selfishness. He continued: "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself" (Eph. 5:28). In these words the apostle made the striking deduction that, since husband and wife are one, the love and consideration extended to the wife must be as intense as the thought and care which the husband bestows upon himself. What a world of practical every-day lessons this verse offers! It challenges husbands to ask themselves whether they lavish generous sums on their own clothing and force their wives to spend a miserable pittance in some bargain basement. It asks them to compare their own expenditures for entertainments and traveling with the recreational expenses incurred by their wives, to put side by side the hours they, the husbands, spend in sports and comfortable ease and the time which their helpmates are permitted to enjoy in parallel pleasures.

When a young woman marries, she takes the name of her husband to signify that she is his, not in any sense of selfish pos-session, but rather in a lifelong association and loving companionship, distinguished by self-denial and conformity to her loved one's wishes. It may sound outmoded and puritanical to tell young people today that this relation should obtain in their marriages. Yet as every disregard of divine ordinance produces the evidence of its own faultiness, so no woman has ever been able to sacrifice her divinely instituted position in marriage without surrendering something noble and feminine. Wherever a young woman, thrilled by the ecstatic realization of a good husband's love, finds her vocation in helping to make life fuller and better for him, - not as his overlord nor as his servile underling, but as his cooperative companion, - this attitude constitutes a key-stone in the arch of fuller marital understanding. It helps lead to the path along which those who would learn more deeply the fine art of living together may walk in rapture.

### CRADLE — OR CAREER?

Her children arise up and call her blessed - Prov. 31:28

WHEN Emil Ludwig enumerated the "ten greatest women of history," his selection in general was as far from true womanly greatness as a tomtom ensemble is from a philharmonic orchestra. In his choice of Madame Curie, Florence Nightingale, and perhaps Harriet Beecher Stowe his selections for a Hall of Female Fame may be seconded, although some cannot agree that these should be included in the select coterie of the world's most distinguished ten. But otherwise he has mentioned some who would be barred from the United States on the ground of moral turpitude, and who are irreconcilably opposed to the ideals of clean, happy womanhood.

#### THE WORLD'S "GREATEST" WOMEN

As his first choice Ludwig mentions Aspasia. He skilfully portrays her as the brilliant companion of the Athenian statesman Pericles, the antidote to his lawful wife. Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, however, has demonstrated that Aspasia, a loose woman, broke up the family of Pericles, lived with him in illicit relations, and after his death reputedly became the mistress of another Athenian. That she was Pericles's inspiration and his political counselor is Ludwig's own view, endorsed otherwise only by the comic poets. Yet there is nothing farcical about the exaltation of this woman who lived without the law; it is stark tragedy. It will be construed by many as a justification of the domestic triangle; it will bring unwarranted sympathy for the husband whose wife "doesn't understand him"; it will lead young women to endorse the "holiness of love outside of marriage," and similar ruinous rot.

Among Ludwig's other "greatest women" is the Marquise de Maintenon. Her claim to this distinction, Ludwig's readers are assured, rests on the self-control, cleverness, and determination through which "she achieved the impossible: the poor girl born in a prison reigned in the palace of Versailles." - This is one side of the story. The other, seamy and sordid, reveals her as an intimate friend of Madame de Montespan, mistress of Louis XIV; and her whole career at court shows that she condoned the foul practices of the polluted French capital. History testifies that, while the legitimate queen lived, Maintenon was the last of a series of Louis's amies. Even her marriage to the philandering king after the queen's death could not set matters straight, because it was a secret arrangement, void of all written proof, in which she was recognized as queen only behind closed doors. To applaud Maintenon is to encourage sinful ambitions among young women who will brook no restriction of law and convention but ride ruthlessly over all moral obstacles.

Ludwig also nominates Elizabeth, queen of England. Her accomplishments, like those of any unusual woman, should be recognized; yet the best that may be said of her is not enough to glorify her as a paragon of feminine accomplishment. Her pronounced masculinity betrayed a notable absence of the finer womanly instincts. If her own age was repeatedly scandalized by her actions, even three centuries of history cannot gloss over her royal inconsistencies.

Catherine of Sienna and Joan of Arc, two more of Ludwig's choice, were unmarried. Why hold up as examples before the young people of America women whose careers offer a studied protest against the blessings of matrimony or acclaim a woman who was first damned by her Church and then blessed by the same body?

To skip over the remaining celebrities in this list of ten female immortals (and Marie Antoinette's participation in the extravagant and dissolute practices of the court society emphatically bar her, while the Italian actress Duse is eliminated because her career lacks the decisive qualities of true greatness), we may conclude in summary that Ludwig has drawn a cartoon instead of painting a charming canvas.

Four of Ludwig's "immortal women" are also selected for a new list of the world's supergreat women. Claiming that 30,000,000,000 people have lived since the beginning of recorded history, that only 5,000 "ever amounted to much," and that only 200 of these 5,000 superdistinguished were women, Dr. Albert Wig-gam, popular syndicate writer, submits his "fifteen greatest women." Writing in Liberty, he says that the following women, judged by the amount of space devoted to their biography in current encyclo-pedias, may be regarded as the preeminent of all history: Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots; Queen Elizabeth of England; Joan of Arc; Madame de Stael, French writer; George Sand, French writer; Queen Catherine II of Russia; Madame de Sevigne, letter-writer; Madame de Maintenon, consort of Louis XIV; Maria Theresa, queen of Hungary; Josephine, wife of Napoleon; Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI; Christina of Sweden; Cleopatra of Egypt; Catherine de Medici, queen of Henry II; Queen Anne of England.

Frankly we are not impressed by this principle of measuring greatness by inches. If encyclopedic space were to be the standard of true value and accomplishment, we should have to conclude that Benedict Arnold was more eminent than Edison; for our edition of the Britannica shows twenty-four and three-quarters inches for Arnold and only four and a half for Edison.

More objectionable, however, is the fact that of these "fifteen finest" only two (Queens Ahne and Maria Theresa) led normal, womanly lives, from the point of view of the Christian home and Christian marriage. Most of the others were brazenly immoral.

#### AMERICA'S GREATEST WOMEN

America's twelve most distinguished women were recently selected on the basis of a nation-wide poll, in which more than 128,000 votes were cast. A thousand women were designated "great leaders," but the twelve greatest of these great, named in the order of their choice, were: Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Scientism; Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize; Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross; Frances E. Willard, founder of the World W.C. T.U.; Susan B. Anthony, suffrage leader; Helen Keller, author, who overcame the handicap of being deaf, dumt, and blind; Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of Uncle Tom's Cabin; Julia Ward Howe, poet, patriot, author of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic"; Carrie Chapman Catt, suffrage leader, chairman of the National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War; Amelia Earhart Put-nam, first woman to make a solo flight across the Atlantic; Mary Lyon, founder of Mount Holyoke College; Mary E. Woolley, president of Mount Holyoke College, president of the American Association of University Women.

I have never seen a catalog of feminine distinction that has not selected for its galaxy some whose achievements protest against the highest womanly ideals. With all its noteworthy names this Chicago list is no exception. When measured by the standards of devotion to wifehood, motherhood, and home-life, the list of women enshrined in the Century of Progress hall presents some noteworthy details. Only three of these distinguished women led normal, married lives: Harriet Beecher Stowe, Julia Ward Howe, and Carrie Chapman Catt. Seven of the twelve were never married, and the two remaining "great leaders" had unusual marital careers. Mary Baker Eddy, for instance, was married three times. Her disillusion has expressed itself in an unmistakable rancor, which assails marriage as a purely carnal arrangement.

This indicates a changing ideal. A woman is regarded as preeminent not because she performs those plain duties laid down for Christian women in the Bible, but because, overlooking entirely her home attachments, she attains to distinction in politics, on the stage, by philanthropy, through literary work, in the professions, business, or allied activities.

#### "THOU EXCELLEST THEM ALL"

Among 600 representative Americans who nominated 200 different women in a ballot for "the most interesting woman in America" one vote should have attracted nation-wide attention. A solitary individual had the temerity to declare that woman attains her highest ideals when, forsaking the roar of business, the mudslinging of politics, and the clash of other careers, she marries, settles down to make a home, proves herself a helpful wife, and cheerfully assumes the responsibilities and blessings of motherhood. These, we may believe, were the sentiments of the person who, at the end of a formidable list of nominations for the stars of first magnitude in the heavens of femininity, dared to propose as "the most interesting woman in America" none other than "a successful mother."

This nomination should be seconded and the election made unanimous, for "a successful mother" is not only the most interest-ing, but also the most valuable woman in our nation. The youth of our land must think clearly and constructively on the ideal of Christian womanhood and avoid those influences which tend to coax wives and mothers from the family.

The glory of consecrated womanhood is clearly emphasized in the Scriptures, particularly in the closing verses of the ode to godly mothers found in the last chapter of Proverbs. Paying tribute to all the varied accomplishments of women, the author admits: "Many daughters have done virtuously"; but he hands the palm of distinction to a mother, the woman who is first of all concerned about her home, her children. He tells her, "Thou excellest them all."

Human experience likewise pays tribute to Christian mother-lisa Centuries and Anhus resued her son ohn guid the he became one of the most eloquent preachers in the history of the Church, his pulpit oratory earning for him the name Chrysostom, "the Golden-mouthed."

Monica led her wayward son Augustine from debauchery to distinction.

The mother of John Huss accompanied her son all the way to the university in Prague, returning alone as best she could.

"I was born," Sir Isaac Newton writes, "in a home of godliness and dedicated to God in my infancy. I was my mother's only child, and almost her whole employment was the care of my educa-tion." A biographer recalls that "every day of her life she prayed with him as well as for him, and every day she sought to store his mind with those majestic and gracious words that, once memorized, can never be altogether shaken from the mind. It was the grief of her death-bed that she was leaving her boy, a little fellow of seven, at the mercy of a rough world; but she had sown the seed faithfully, and she hoped for a golden harvest."

The mother of Abraham Lincoln was one of the sources of his strength and ambition. He said: "All that I am and all that I hope to be I owe to my angel mother."

On the day of his election Grover Cleveland wrote his brother, the Rev. William N. Cleveland, with this expression of gratitude for maternal guidance, "Do you know if Mother were alive, I would feel so much safer? I have always thought that her prayers had so much to do with my success."

John Wanamaker, merchant prince, acknowledged his indebtedness to his mother's guidance in these words: "My first love was my mother, and my first home was on her breast. My first bed was upon her bosom. Leaning little arms upon her knees, I learned my first prayers. A bright lamp she lit in my soul that never dies down or goes out though the winds and waves of four-score years have swept over me. Sitting in my mother's old atm-chair, which she loved because her first-born son gave it to her forty years ago, I am writing this, with the evening twilight coming on. With the darkness falling, I seem to lose myself in the flood of memories and to feel that the arms of the chair have loosed themselves to become my very own mother's arms around me again, drawing me to her bosom, the happiest place on earth, just as she used to do in the days and nights long gone by. I feel the touch of her little hand on my brow, and I hear her voice as she smooths my hair and calls me her boy, her very own boy."

Michael Pupin, internationally known for his discoveries relative to long-distance telegraphy and telephony, in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor, exalts the guidance of his mother, a Serbian peasant woman; despite her illiteracy she always remained his ideal and directed his course aright even though his father would have planted insurmountable obstacles in the way.

These tributes to motherhood, chosen at random from various ages, illustrate a truth that demands modern reemphasis. Woman's greatness lies not in endurance flights, laboratory achievements, suffrage agitation, prohibition propaganda, professional preemi-nences, and pulpit preaching but in the hallowed devotion to the home. To a larger extent than many of us realize the finest and best attainments of our lives have been reached, under God, by a mother's devoted direction. Our first prayers, the sharpened distinction between right and wrong, the molding of our plastic characters, the predominant emphasis on the good, the true, the beautiful, the avoidance of the catastrophes of sin, these basic blessings we must attribute largely, under divine blessing, to our mothers and their steadfast devotion to home and family.

#### CAREER AFTER MARRIAGE?

One of the opposing influences is the desire for a career after the wedding. This draws an increasing number of women from their homes. The percentage of married women at work in American industries has doubled since 1890, having increased proportionately much faster than the number of having unmarried women employees. According to a study of the United States Census Bureau, in 1920, 8,346,796 women above the age of fifteen were gainfully employed. In 1930 this number rose to 10,632,149, or an increase during the decade of more than 27 per cent. In the same period, however, the employment of married women increased from 1,920,281 to 3,071,302, a growth of 60 per cent.

The Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor, in a survey of four representative cities (Jacksonville, Florida; Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; Butte, Montana; and Pas-saic, New Jersey) found that of the bread-winning women 55 per cent were or had been married; of the married women wage-earners 50 per cent had children.

A study of the 1930 census figures shows that of all women employed in trades, 35.3 per cent were married; in domestic ser-vice, 35 per cent; in manufacturing, 32.4 per cent; of those in clerical work, 18.3 per cent.

The motives behind this away-from-the-home employment after marriage are varied. Economic reverses frequently make it imperative for a wife and mother to assume the role of wage-earner and to assist a husband incapacitated or unable to secure profitable employment. Under these circumstances every Christian wife should willingly shoulder additional responsibility.

Few of us have a real picture of the extent to which American married women are forced to help support their families. The figures compiled recently by'the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and published in The Woman Worker, July, 1939, contain startling information. Investigators visited 25,800 native white families not on relief that were "complete" families, that is, they contained at least both husband and wife, and in 650 of these families the chief wage-earner was the wife. The report concludes that "more than 2,000 wives in the city [Chicago] ... are the sole support" of their families.

Again, there are talented women whose unusual endowments are often drafted by public necessity or welfare. There are those, too, who in spite of the care required for their children can engage in part-time work because they employ extra help. All this is the exceptional; and no one but a bigoted zealot could protest. Even here unhappy extremes can develop, and Mrs. Cora Harris, popular novelist, writing in the Saturday Evening Post, appropriately suggests spinsterhood for female genius that is unwilling to be hampered by home duties: "I am not opposed to the glory and distinctions of world-conscious women, you understand, but the point I make is that they should play fair and remain spinsters. They belong to public life... and should not assume the duties of wives and mothers and homes, for which they have neither the mind nor the time. Some of them will have tall monuments raised to their memory by public subscription; but if I should deserve so much as a marker no taller than the knees of my remains, I hope it will be private and personal to my own life, with a brief legend on it saying whose wife I was and whose mother and referring to me kindly as a somewhat beloved woman."

Many women constantly before the public have sincerely preferred home-life. In the June, 1936, Good Housekeeping magazine, Kirsten Flagstad, Metropolitan Opera soprano, confesses: "While I love my music and deeply appreciate the unbelievable welcome given me here, I do not consider singing my real career. I shall not continue it indefinitely. It is just this knowledge that allows me to go on with it. I look forward to the time when I shall again have the quiet home-life of my early married years.

"Music is my career in the sense that I devote my best efforts to it and try to give satisfaction. It is most definitely not my career in the sense in which a man embraces his career — as the one big interest in his life, that must go on for the sake of his loved ones and never be interrupted. That sort of career is waiting for me at home.

"These, then, are the circumstances under which I believe a married woman can have a career. If she needs to work as my mother did, the question settles itself. But where the career becomes a problem to be argued about, there can be but one possible solution. That solution must grow out of a consideration for the home responsibilities which every wife assumes as a holy obligation the day she marries. I do not say that no married woman should work. But I am old-fashioned enough to believe that the decision must take into account more than merely her own whims and pleasures. The first consideration must be the home, the husband, the family. No married woman has the right to develop herself at their expense. No woman has a right selfishly to deprive a man of the warmth, the care, and the companionship which he is entitled to expect of her."

On the other hand, in cases all too prevalent the wife continues to work after marriage even though her husband earns an ample salary and the income of her independent career is not required for the support of the home. This practice is usually hazardous and frequently destructive to the highest family ideals.

Magistrates who have witnessed the endless succession of domestic tragedies are emphatic in their disapproval of the working-after-marriage idea. Says Supreme Court Justice Dike of Brooklyn: "For wives, business careers are almost invariably antagonistic to domestic duties and having children. The cold calculation of trade chills the warmth of home-life." Justice Southern of Kansas City, in refusing to grant a divorce to a woman secretary of the Kansas Public Service Commission, warns: "Whenever the wife participates actively in politics and in holding public office, she has instituted a régime which is incompatible with domestic relations. It cannot be done. It is just as incompatible as Church and State. Cooperation of Church and State is fatal to government, and the attempted mixture of a public career in politics by a wife is fatal in the home." And Justice Samuel E. Kramer, magistrate in the Common Pleas Court of Cleveland, asserts: "In seventy-five per cent of all divorces which I have granted I find that both husband and wife were working outside the home."

#### CHAMPIONS OF WORKING WIVES

Of course, this extradomestic activity for married women has been warmly defended. Katherine Bush, New York novelist, protests: "I think that any girl is foolish to give up her job when she marries. The wives who work are more interesting to their husbands." Divorce statistics contradict this claim; for the normal husbands will be permanently devoted only to a home-loving, home-sustaining wife.

Others find the employment of the wife a cure for the dangerous idleness which marriage sometimes imposes. However, wifehood and motherhood usually leave little time to spare. These responsibilities are so exacting that, even with the most modern equip-ment, time can never drag heavily for a woman who wants to keep her home attractive and meet the obligations which a family imposes. If in our apartment-house world the young matron who presides over a three-room efficiency flat can complete her domestic routine in a few hours, she can utilize the remaining leisure for self-improvement, employment at home, or for charitable and missionary purposes.

Housekeeping, it is further asserted, restricts a woman's freedom and anesthetizes her spirit, while business contacts lead to broader horizons and afford a healthy outlet for the restlessness experienced by many wives. This overstates the opportunities of office duties and minimizes those of home-life. Many women employed in large offices as well as in the highly standardized piece-work system of a factory are victims of a routine so monotonous that even household tasks offer a positive escape. An alert young housewife can regulate her domestic duties so that she will have more time for intellectual or social contacts than the woman tied down to regular office or factory hours. Drastic restrictions will be imposed by the arrival of children; but the new compensation of this added life interest need not rule out wider cultural and social avenues. We hold no brief for those who would chain the modern mother to the kitchen as the household drudge; but experience will show that of two wives of the same age and of similar social and intellectual status, the one a housewife and the other an office worker, the wife who stays home will ordinarily be the more natural, the more experienced in vital human issues.

Another endorsement of employment after the wedding is the repeated assertion that the married woman is frequently a more reliable employee than the single worker. An office manager, interviewed concerning the married women on his pay-roll, claims: "We welcome married women here. They are sometimes better employees than unmarried women. We want women who are settled down, who have reached some serious purpose in life. The married woman more frequently knows what she wants and is willing to work until she gets it. Many unmarried women are not like that; they are searching for something. Married women are more serious in their work.". We find two fundamental errors. First of all, not every single woman is devoid of the power of concentration on her work; and then, the employment of married women may be good for business without being helpful to the home.

Finally, the most frequent argument advanced by working wives is this, that the extra revenue affords the enjoyment of luxuries which a restricted income excludes. This line of reasoning misunderstands the essential purposes of marriage and neglects the apostolic word which lays it upon the conscience of young women "to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own hus-bands, that the Word of God be not blasphemed" (Titus 2:4, 5). Besides, the financial advantages are overestimated. Miss Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor, claimed on the basis of her experience as industrial commissioner of the New York State Department of Labor that, unless a working mother makes more than $3,500 a year, she loses money by her employment. Miss Perkins, herself a married worker, further insists that the financial advantages are not as glamorous as they are often made to appear, for: "The working mother has to pay in many ways for her business freedom, because she has to shoulder unnecessary household expenses, medical attention for her children, and wages for additional servants. Conventional servants do not like to work for women who go to work. They like the women to be home and occasionally chat with them. Many servants leave such an establishment; so the part-time mother is constantly seeking new servants. Shopping is the main occupation of women today, and a good shopper can save much money. The part-time mother is so busy that she must take what the shops give her."

#### THE CLASH OF CAREER AND DOMESTIC INTERESTS

As these and other arguments in behalf of the outside employment of married women are weighed in review, the conviction remains that the young bride who ventures out into the sea of matrimony with only half her attention on the compass of happiness need not be surprised if she finds herself drifting about in untried waters or headed toward rocky shores. Nor should the young husband who permits his wife to maintain her former business connections (except for reason of the emergencies noted) complain when he realizes that his dreams of home blessing are not being fulfilled. Employment on the part of the wife makes for separated interests. When a young wife, allowing for extraordinary situations, deserts her home to keep her premarriage posi-tion, her absence can never draw her closer to her husband, solidify her interest in the home, and promote family unity. In a recent monograph published by the United States Census Bureau Dr. Joseph A. Hill, assistant census director, answers the question "Do gainfully employed married women have a normal home-life?" on the basis of a special study conducted in ten cities (Providence, Rochester, Paterson, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City, Atlanta, Louisville, and New Orleans). He finds that 37.6 per cent of the married women engaged in gainful occupations were not living with their husbands in homes of their own. Dr. Hill draws the salient conclusion: "If the normal home-life of a married woman be defined as living with her husband in a home of her own, then somewhat more than one third of these women gainfully employed did not have a normal home-life."

Nor does the employment of the wife, as a rule, operate for the benefit of her husband. The director of the employment bureau in one of the largest business houses in New York City has this to say of the husband of the working wife: "If he is a real man, he will object to having his wife work. If he is not, she deprives him of his ambition; he lets down in his own efforts and is continually willing to allow her to struggle under the whole load of supporting the family." If, as it frequently happens in the curious complexes of our business world, the wife attains to a position which commands a salary larger than the husband's, the danger is ever present that a feeling of superiority, at least subconsciously, may cast its shadow over a wife's estimate of her husband.

Another score against this wide-spread employment of married women is of course the childlessness which it endorses and promotes. Because a working wife is ordinarily unable or unwilling to take care of a baby, married couples often regard it more convenient to postpone the advent of children or to have no children at all. It is a bad bargain, this sacrifice of motherhood for the glamor of a career; and the incriminating practices which it provokes often reap their own ruin.

Even if by means which are sometimes astonishing a wife is able to combine her devotions to both cradle and career, her children are deprived of the full enjoyment of the highest gift within the power of human disposal — a mother's love. A large salary may enable a working mother to employ a nurse for her baby or to give her children unusual educational opportunities. Yet the total of these advantages cannot compensate for the personal care, the sympathetic consideration, the maternal love, for which God created mothers.

Once more Kirsten Flagstad, with well-pointed argument, remarks: "Many women try to justify their being away from home all day by saying that they have a competent maid or governess. This, to my mind, is no argument at all. For, necessary as the actual work of the house is, it is not so important as the atmosphere that pervades the home. And the building of such an atmosphere is the wife's first job. She may be able to hire a maid who cooks better than she does; she may have the most-credentialed governess for her children. But the spirit in her household will be indifferent, mechanical, unless she herself gives out the warmth, the heartiness, and the sense of unity that alone can transform a series of rooms into a home.

"I am sorry for men who sit down to perfect meals that are cooked without personal warmth. I am sorry for little children who pour out their earliest prattlings to nursemaids. A woman who deliberately lets these things happen, for no better reason than her own pleasure, is not playing fair. And no one but the wife herself can give her home the warmth, the confidence, and the all-important desire for a merging closeness which transcends all human values. These things must never be allowed to suffer." (L.c.)

Working wives suffer in other ways. By continually rubbing elbows with the hard-fisted realities of business life, by taking the place of men in the affairs of industry and commerce, by meeting male employers or employees in their own field and often on their own terms, it is inevitable that the finer sensibilities of womanhood are often blunted. True, this confronts even the unmarried woman worker; but through the combination of unfavorable influences already noted it becomes the more serious for the working wife.

Besides, this double duty in factory or office and home cannot promote health. Even the thirty-two or forty hours, to which the new age has humanely reduced the working week of many women employees, plus the energy required to keep up with domestic duties, often impose a heavy mental and physical strain. Meyrick Booth has shown that with the escape from the Victorian home and the participation in the battle called business has come an environment unfavorable to healthy motherhood and an important factor in the appreciable rise of deaths from childbirth within the last twenty years. In an investigation by the Federal Women's Bureau it was found that, when a mother goes to work before the baby is one year old, every fourth child dies (almost double the rate for mothers of the same class who stay at home). The tax which family and business place upon a mother's body and mind cannot be tabulated statistically. Altogether it is one of the chief contributory factors to premature aging, nervous breakdown, and many complications of lingering illnesses.

The employment of wives and mothers is unsound also economically. Married women work for less money than men and consequently often replace male workers. Some enthusiastic proponents of women's work, lobbyists against ordinances designed to regulate working conditions for married women, have been industrialists, eager to exploit this form of cheaper labor. Nor must it be forgotten that in times of financial depression and unemployment many of the married women's positions could well be filled by jobless fathers. The husband of the working wife may hold a lucrative position, while the family of an unemployed wage-earner may be in desperate need. The recognition of this fact has repeatedly prompted business houses during industrial crises to dismiss all married women workers and give their positions to unemployed men. Section 213 of the Economy Act of 1932, which was reenacted in 1936, requires that, when Government departments reduce their forces, married workers who have husbands or wives working in the Government service shall be the first to be laid off and that in classified civil service these married workers shall be the last considered for appointment.

While it is difficult to discover any permanent advantages in the employment of wives when their help is not actually demanded by financial necessity, many dangers are involved in this division of God's ordinances and the divinely established sphere of women's peculiar privileges. Here and there one may find a brilliant woman who somehow or other escapes the conflict between cradle and career; but the welfare of the nation is not fortified by the contribution of exceptions. Domestic prosperity is advanced most permanently by the girl who enters the holy relation of marriage with a heart-deep appreciation of motherhood, with a comprehensive resolution to help build a home, and with the conviction of God's abiding love. That bride not only marches in the front ranks of the most interesting, the most useful, and the most essential women of America, but she is also one of the greatest uplifting forces of the present age.

God give us multiplied millions of such young women!

### BACK TO DOMESTICITY!

She looketh well to the ways of her household - Prov. 31:27

The Knight of La Tour, observant French medievalist and raconteur, tells of a nobleman who, returning from a long sojourn in foreign parts, brought back as gifts to each of his two attractive nieces a gown of ravishing fabric. When he waited to present the dress to the first niece, she took so long in primping that his patience was exhausted, and he stamped off in chagrin. The other niece, when he arrived, was in the midst of baking bread, all covered with flour. Yet, when she burst forth from the kitchen to embrace him and to apologize for her appearance, he was so overcome by her affectionate welcome and the evidence of her domestic acquirements that he presented her with both gowns.

Today, if a twentieth-century uncle should return from a transAtlantic trip bearing the latest Paris creations as gifts to two modern counterparts of these medieval nieces, he might have to keep the gowns if their bestowal were conditioned by evidences of domesticity. The best for which he could hope would be that one of the nieces might be found wielding a determined can-opener on some recalcitrant tin. For, whether we like it or not, there is an unmistakable neglect of the home duties which a generation or two ago were regarded as the indispensable accomplishments of every bride.

Startling figures show the tremendous change that began largely in the last generation. Only one of every four city families still does its own washing; one out of every hundred urban families and twenty out of every hundred farm families have home-made bread. (New York Times, August 27, 1933.)

Similar statistics from other phases of household activities are available. The increase of ready-to-wear clothing reminds us that in most homes the cutting and fitting of family clothing remains only in fading memories. The rapid growth of apartments, with their long list of efficiency features and their janitor service, is one of the characteristic developments of our age. To afford even more freedom, the family hotel appeals to an annually increasing group of the younger married couples and lures them into an existence in which cooking, cleaning, mending, and allied occupations are almost unknown. In the modern helter-skelter many young women have no time and little interest before marriage to acquaint themselves through personal experience with the various household duties, just as after marriage (especially because of the steadily growing number of employed working wives) they may often find even less opportunity for personal supervision of the home.

With all the commendable aspects of this change, the emancipation from domestic duties often contributes to a loosening of the home ties. Where the wife is so preoccupied that she does not have the ability, energy, or time to serve home-cooked, nourishing meals, to keep her home neat and attractive, to care for her husband's wardrobe, and to meet the other duties of housekeeping, we frequently find the beginnings of misunderstandings, petty annoyances, and irritations, which too often assume fatal proportions.

At least this is the warning issued by sociologists. In a Colgate University questionnaire sent to the married men and women listed in Who's Who in America it was found that 15 per cent of the men and 10 per cent of the women listed poor cooking, irregularity in meals, and associate causes as disturbing elements in their home relations.

The Chicago Tribune compiled opinions of Cook County, Illi-nois, domestic-court judges concerning the causes of divorce. Among the most prominent were these: "Poor cooking, diminution of the domestic instinct in the emancipated woman, too many meals served out of tin cans."

In San Francisco, Judge Thomas J. Graham, who has heard divorce actions in that Pacific Coast city for many years, warns young men: "Never marry a girl who has soft white hands when her mother's are roughened by hard work. She won't be a good helpmate."

Conversely, however, good cooking may be an aid to romance and a support of married happiness. When some one asked J. Ogden Armour of Chicago what quality of his wife captivated him most, he stated: "I did not feel especially interested in this young lady, though we were good friends, till one evening her father gave a dinner to a lot of men. I was invited and learned that the cook had left unexpectedly and that the delicious dinner was prepared and served under the direction and supervision of his daughter. I found my way to the kitchen after a while; and I don't think she ever looked prettier than she did in the big gingham apron, her cheeks pink with excitement, a dab of four on her nose, and she was making dishes step about as if by magic. That settled it for me. I decided that what I needed was somebody who took an interest in her home instead of being a mere butterfly."

A visitor to the home of William Jennings Bryan, at a time when a notable group had gathered there to receive election returns, found Mrs. Bryan on the back porch making blackberry jam and evidently neglecting the guests, some of whom were of national importance. Asked why she was so preoccupied with these domestic duties, she replied: "Whichever way the election goes, Mr. Bryan will enjoy blackberry jam with his biscuits."

#### THE PRACTICAL HOUSEWIFE

The Church does not advocate a materialistic philosophy of marriage which teaches that the avenue of easiest approach to the male cardiac region is by way of the alimentary system. For the essential requirements of marital bliss are unselfish love, compatibility in religious life, and the happy spirit of camaraderie. All else is secondary, and a marriage that never rises above the food level never reaches the first stage of permanent happiness.

We are also far from championing kitchen drudgery with its drab background of greasy pans and unwashed dishes. Instead we plead for labor-saving, health-preserving devices to unchain the young wife from the kitchen. But we must protest against the vagabond complex, the selfish urge which draws the wife to the country club, the matinee, the literary luncheon, the bridge tourna-ment, but which drives husbands to cafeterias in the first cleft of a widening breach.

Miss Gertrude Fitts, dietician, warns: "If every girl that becomes engaged would spend as much time penetrating her trousseau, there would be many more happy marriages and fewer tragedies of a breakfast marred by muddy coffee, heavy biscuits, and overcooked eggs."

Investigations made purely on a social and economic basis emphasize that the ideal wife cooks, launders, sews, and is a paragon of wisdom "from etiquette to calories and from fashion to cleanli-ness." Through a set of information tests formulated by the Household Arts Education Department of Teachers' College, Columbia University, the following interesting conclusions were reached: "It appears that the ideal housewife is adept at keeping a house, makes and mends both her and her husband's clothing, does the washing of the household, and is an accomplished diplomat and financier. She never groans over her fate of being a home-keeper, and her one object in life seems to be to make home a happier place. She is an old-fashioned mother who shuns delicatessens, is her own laundress.... To be an ideal wife, the model wife must know that tomatoes contain more vitamins than meat or sugar, that baking-powder biscuits should bake for twelve minutes and no longer, that there are two cups to a pound of sugar, and that a quart of milk will make four cups of white sauce. Food, however, is only a minor item in the knowledge of this ideal wife. She dresses her family and herself simply, but in the latest fashions."

Entirely concordant is this statement of Henry C. Herman, professor of chemistry, also of Columbia University: "It may be far-fetched to establish a connection between food values and happy marriages, but this much is certain, that the housewife who has a true knowledge of nutrition will be able to put her family on a diet which will insure health; and where there is health, there is almost certain to be resultant happiness."

#### PREMARRIAGE TRAINING

Small wonder, then, that systematic efforts seek to remove the resentment against housework, that protest is raised against rash feminists like a vice-chairman of the National Women's Party, who declared: "There is no reason why a woman should become a slave when she takes the marriage vow; that is what she really does when she contracts to keep house, cook, sew, and raise [sic] children for her board and keep."

To counteract such perversions, we should have schools for home-makers. While the distinction of establishing a school for brides, the first of its kind in the world, belongs to Luther's city, Eisenach, Germany, with its institution for the theoretical and practical problems of the modern wife, called Heimglueckhaus (Happy Home Institute), our Federal Government and our State Legislatures have helped to provide facilities for the training of young women in domestic science. In New York alone there are several hundred centers under the supervision of the State Department of Education where home-making is taught as a fine art. The number of Federally aided home-economics classes in day-schools, evening and part-time schools, has increased steadily. Last year 272 colleges and universities in our country (about one third of the entire number) had courses on the preparation for marriage.

Since most single young women are employed and usually have little opportunity to enroll in extended domestic-science courses, it is true, as the Boston Transcript declares, that "hundreds of young women with only a fraction of the domestic training their mothers had continue their office employment to the very eve of their wedding and then suddenly face the task of housekeeping without previous equipment or preparation."

Where there is a will, the proverbial way will be found. And the very best of the many ways (including the specialized books on this subject, the evening school, the correspondence school, and similar aids) is the practical and detailed work under maternal instruction. Energetic cooperation in the varied phases of the home duties, besides giving substantial help to the mother, often brings its own reward in helping to lay the foundation for wedded bliss strong enough to withstand the whirlwind that may seek to raze its happiness. A young man chooses well when he selects as his helpmate a Christian young woman who, with all other commendable qualities, is guided by a domestic instinct; who, while she may not be perfect in her kitchen technique, is eager to learn and to equip herself with substantial experience. Her charm will come into its full and estimable growth long after the drug-store beauty of a selfish, snob-bish, pampered pet has lost its attraction.

#### THE GOLDEN A-B-C OF FAMILY FELICITY

A religious society in Great Britain some time ago sent a copy of the Book of Proverbs to each of its members, under the conviction that its chapters contain a practical summary of wisdom applicable to our modern life problems. If we were to select one portion of this remarkable book that has particular bearing on the contribution which a young wife can make to her home, we should choose these verses from the last chapter, which have well been called "the a-b-c of family felicity" or "the golden scroll of woman's highest attainment":

Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies.

The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.

She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

She seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands.

She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.

She riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens.

She considereth a field and buyeth it; with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.

She girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms.

She perceiveth that her merchandise is good; her candle goeth not out by' night.

She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.

She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.

She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet.

She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.

Her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land.

She maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.

Strength and honor are her clothing, and she shall rejoice in time to come.

She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness.

She looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness.

Her children arise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.

Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.

Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.

Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates. (Prov. 31:10-31.)

Substitute for "wool" and "fax" and "candles" their modern counterparts, and we have divine authority for the emphasis which the Church lays on a housewife's devotion to her home. Despite all insistent claims to the contrary, it is in loyalty to the domestic instinct that young women exert some of their richest influences.

### FAMILY FINANCES

There is.. oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. - Prov. 21:20

On a high hill near the center of Toronto one of the most palatial residences ever erected by man rears its crenelated turrets. Some conception of its grandeur may be derived from the fact that this mansion contains fifty rooms and almost as many baths, a library with accommodations for 500 people, three bowling-alleys, a gym-nasium, a conservatory seating 3,000 guests, and other features too numerous to detail here, but all proportionately immense and luxurious. With three bronze doors that cost $14,000 each, a domed stable that represents an outlay of $200,000, the figure given for the entire cost of the castle and its furnishings, $2,000,000, may be regarded as conservative.

By a combination of irony and tragedy this regal structure is empty; its 800 windows are shuttered against the sunlight, and specterlike, cloths cover the floor, walls, and furnishings. For Sir Henry Pellatt, the builder and owner, who became a broker at the age of fifteen and later rose to a commanding position in Canadian fairs, put about all the money he had it the construction of this gorgeous home. Instead of happiness it brought him financial disaster, and the magnificent estate, which was called "Casa Loma," now bears the popular title "Pellatt's Folly."

This is a graphic, if isolated, example of domestic disasters provoked by mistakes in household finances. A study involving 1,000 families in Boston showed that in more than half of these homes friction originated from thoughtless or selfish attitudes toward money on the part of either husband or wife, or both. Another investigation, conducted by Dr. Donald A. Laird, revealed that even in notable American homes a specific cause for discord is often found in financial matters. Through the cooperation of the married men and women in Who's Who in America a cross-section of the higher strata of American life was secured, since only one in approximately 4,000 Americans is included in this "biographical dictionary of notable living men and women." While the families thus interrogated were economically stable and in no particular danger of meeting financial disaster, it was found that of those answering half of the men and a slightly smaller percentage of the women listed money quarrels as a major cause for domestic discord.

#### INCREASED LEVIES ON THE HOUSEHOLD TREASURY

Obvious factors have combined to complicate these money problems and to raise the cost of maintaining a modern family. Unknown a generation ago, several new expenditures have been foisted upon us by the higher standards of living during the last third of a century. Every advance in culture brings a parallel demand for the enjoyment of the attractive and the artistic. With an increasing appreciation of art, music, literature, a higher plane of living is created. Our American homes are, on the average, the most attractive in the nation's history. Our radios and musical instruments, our books and magazines, our rugs and draperies, our furniture and home equipment in general, — all these, even in the more modest homes, are evidence of a standard of living completely dazzling to the poverty-stricken people of the Old World. This necessarily imposes heavier drains on the family exchequer.

Radical changes in food supply requiring increased outlay have occurred even within the memory of many readers. We recall, not altogether without a pang of regret, the biweekly baking, the back-yard vegetable garden, the fruit-cellar with row upon row of canned vegetables and preserves. Now we have scientifically baked bread, cut for our tables. We find it easier to purchase vegetables from the huckster or at the corner grocery than to fight against the unequal odds of city gardening. We have torn down the preserve closet to make way for the oil-burner. But all this raises the family budget.

Modern marketing and transportation have worked dietary wonders in the American bill of fare. It is not long since the first fresh green vegetables came into Mid-Western homes shortly before Maundy Thursday or soon after the arrival of spring; now. one can have strawberries in January and Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, watercress, and broccoli the year round. The shipments of fresh fish, oysters, and sea food from the coast to inland States; the fast fruit express transporting the golden yield of California and Florida orchards to our tables; the refrigerator cars distributing Wisconsin's dairy products to localities almost a thousand miles away, these are typical achievements in rapid food delivery attained during our lifetime. But, again, these are achievements for which the consumer pays.

In addition, we have put the comforts and conveniences of home-life into the category of necessities. Our plumbing, heating systems, labor-saving and time-saving devices, electric kitchens, and lavish baths not only add to the ease of life but also increase the original cost and maintenance of a home. Some one has estimated that a century ago the average American had seventy-two wants, sixteen of which were classified as necessities. Today, we are told, the average man must answer the appeal of 484 wants, of which ninety-four are regarded as necessities. Life today embraces many complexities, and complexities, in turn, always involve expenditures. The simple life with its plain economic basis, its home-made food and hand-made clothing, its humble demands and generally unpretentious atmosphere, has passed on in the parade of progress and has bequeathed us an easier but more expensive mode of life.

#### AGENCIES OF FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENT

A taxing drain on many American families is the headless obsession of living beyond one's means, that chains the wage-earners to an endless treadmill. This spirit of squandering is one of the predominant sins of the day and has pervaded even our home environment, particularly in the form of that mortgage on income conventionally known as the instalment plan. A public benefactor would be the inventor who could suggest some invisible coat of mail to frustrate the glib attacks of that practical psychologist, the overambitious salesman. Professionally trained in the art of breaking customer resistance, his merciless attack on the family income is launched regardless of all consequences. The confessions of an automobile dealer recorded by Harper's Magazine plainly describe the sales methods employed in disposing of a car to a young father who had no definite need for the machine and whose income would hardly warrant its up-keep. "It wasn't our business," the dealer admits, "whether the young fellow had use for a car or not; the main thing was that he had $200 in cash." In the sequel to this sale we are told that the purchaser could never make another payment; he died, leaving his family destitute.

We can compute the amount which the American homes lose through burglary and theft or through fraudulent investments and blue-sky stocks, but we shudder when we think of the total loss incurred by thoughtless, needless expenditures. If all the evidence of the senseless• spending, could be extracted from our American homes: the electric belts and quasi-scientific medical apparatus; the plaster-of-Paris monstrosities in the form of highly colored kewpies, Charlie McCarthy and Popeye dolls; the dust-catching paper flowers and the pajama dolls with knotted limbs; the millions-now-living-will-never-die literature; the correspondence courses on coconut painting, oratory overnight, Chopin in ten les-sons; in short, if all the numberless items in America's senseless spending orgy could be redeemed for the original purchase price, the funds restored to our family treasuries would be more than enough to offset the results of a depression. Statistical sleuths would be able to tell us that, if every dollar thus saved were placed side by side, this financial belt would stretch from Poverty Flats, Ohio, to Wealthy, Michigan.

Even more hazardous is the allurement of installment buying. Under the magic slogans of "Easily Extended Credit" or "A Little Down and a Little Every Month" the husband's salary is often garnisheed for many years to come. The initial payments may seem small individually, but in their aggregate, swollen by usurious in-terest, they soon assume depressing proportions. A reliable motto for all young married couples is: "Never purchase anything unless you can pay cash"; for this principle, if conscientiously followed, eliminates the difficulties and the regret which the relentless demands of credit purchasing entail. Instalment buying is the most expensive form of purchase. Those who buy on this deferred-payment plan pay from 6 to 16 per cent more than those who pay cash, since the installment seller must protect himself against loss in consequence of refusal to pay, repossession and resale. He must add carrying charges and routine expenses unknown in cash transactions.

Despite this excessive cost young people often indulge in a spending spree, forgetting that under the installment plan they must pay and pay and pay. H. A. Gibans, credit manager of a Milwaukee department store, has watched thousands of newly-weds start their married life and has observed that the roseate expectations of romances have often been shattered on the rocks of indebtedness. He declares: "The average young people blindly plunge into serious debts without the slightest idea of how the bills eventually will be paid. Young couples usually want all the advantages and luxuries that they enjoyed in the homes of their parents. If they start without savings, it can't be done. Too often a young couple will come to the store for more than $1,000 worth of furniture. Perhaps both are working, and they believe they can pay $50 a month. That double income is the most dangerous thing in the world to figure on. We always try to figure on the man's income, for experience has taught us that this is the only safe way. The woman may become sick; or there may be a baby, and the mother would have to give up her job. There are many ways by which the couple is reduced to a single income. Of course, some of them, if they are made of sterner stuff and good fortune is with them, clear themselves of indebtedness and in four or five years have paid off what they owe. But there are lots of others who find that they are not able to deny themselves many things they were accustomed to; and when they pay one bill, they make another. Heavy debts are almost certain to cause discontent when they drag on continually, and too often they lead to broken homes and divorce."

Under pressure of unfavorable circumstances it may become necessary to make instalment purchases as a last resort. In this extremity several precautions should be observed. First of all, never deal with any other than high-grade, first-class concerns. Beware of lurid advertisements, fictitious fire sales, and fraudulent bankrupt stocks. Be sure that a separate contract is drawn up for each item purchased. If the furnishings of the entire house are bought under one contract and the young couple is unable to maintain the terms (which always appear more exacting a year after the sale), the entire furnishings may be "repossessed." Even if $600 or $700 has been paid on a $1,000 purchase, it is possible under the one-contract plan to lose the entire $1,000 worth of goods. If, how-ever, a separate obligation has been made for each item, only those articles on which payments lapse may be taken.

An investigator of installment purchasing issues this further warning: "Another favorite trick of some installment houses which is to be guarded against is that, when the final payment is about to be made on items bought, the salesman will try to induce the customer to buy some additional things and will say: "We do not have to make out a new contract; we will just add to the old one.' Then, if the payments are not kept up on the new items bought, all the old items can be "repossessed" because of the one contract covering everything. The legal-aid societies of the country are working overtime straightening out difficulties caused in just this way. As much care and caution must be taken in signing an installment contract as in the case of any other mortgage. An installment contract is a chattel mortgage and has the same force as a mortgage on the home. The only difference is that it covers specific items, whereas the real-estate mortgage covers ground and buildings." (Harold Holt, Building Family Foundations, pp. 30, 31.)

Only one phase of our financial difficulties is more dangerous than an installment purchase, and that is the usurious small-loan business. Lending-offices, which dot the map of our country, extend loans in such a large aggregate that their business is now the fourth in volume in the United States. Their legal interest rates run from 12 to 45 per cent annually. Without-the-law methods often sky-rocket this rate. It has been shown, for example, that Iowans during 1931 borrowed $2,000,000 in small loans and paid $2,400,000 in interest, a rate of 120 per cent. — To counteract this ruthless usury, thousands of credit unions have been organized throughout the land.

#### A NEW ERA WITH FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENT

Prospective brides and grooms who have witnessed the transition from dollars to doles must be ready to adjust themselves. They should save themselves the torment of endeavoring to attain the unattainable, of raising, like Tantalus, their clutching hands for the everlastingly elusive. Accommodating themselves to the limits of a lesser luxury, they will find that, though the new domestic régime may sometimes demand a rigorous simplicity, these restrictions are often character-building.

Self-denial will be required in frustrating the tendency to live beyond the income. An automobile may be a much-desired addition to the convenience and pleasure of a family; but when its purchase and the expense of maintenance absorb the entire financial sur-plus, and when even a middle-priced car entails an outlay of at least forty dollars a month for operation, maintenance, deterioration, insurance, loss of interest, it becomes evident that for a husband with a salary of $150 and with other normal expenses an auto is a prohibitive luxury.

The keep-up-with-the-neighbors complex must vanish if we are to return to healthy home normalcy. The young matron whose eyes linger on the wraps of mink and the fulsome wardrobe of others in her social set must learn to resign herself to the lower level of the fur-trimmed cloth. The family across the street may banish the icy chills of February mornings by the magic of the thermostat; but if the domestic pocketbook cannot be stretched to provide the luxury of self-regulating gas heat, we must accept the anthracite and the furnace chores, not in a spirit of protest but with the optimism that gratefully recognizes how much more uncomfortable the situation might be.

Particularly during the ten years from twenty-five to thirty-five should thrift and cautious expenditure assert themselves. During this decade, well called the "age of accumulation," more houses are built, more babies come into the world, and more goods are purchased than in any other corresponding period of life. The concentration of buying in this ten-year bracket, when newly established families are acquiring their equipment, brings an underscored appeal for careful financial outlay.

If our arrested prosperity will help to reestablish sanity in home-life by persuading Americans to eat simpler and better food, to find health in the exercise of walking rather than obesity in the comfort of motoring, to stay at home instead of swelling the away-from-the-hearth movement, to rise up against the capricious dictates of commercialized fashion, and in general to live and act with the rationality demanded by our well-being and dictated by individual financial limitations, then the depression cloud will indeed have a silver lining.

#### BUDGET BLESSINGS

Money reserves would be increased and family friction reduced if even a fraction of the effort devoted to the acquisition of money were directed toward the very a-b-c of its release. An inflexible budget may not be a blessing, but there should be some method of proportionate distribution by which the household income can be administered effectively. An adaptable, elastic budget of expenses, one which takes into consideration the personnel of the individual family and which serves as a guide rather than a dictator, will operate with encouraging results. Indeed, the claim has been made that "the family which budgets its expenditures is getting at least 25 per cent more use of its income than one which does not know where or how the money goes and operates only on impulse."

In a survey published by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company we find these significant cases of stabilized finance, which are eloquent testimonies to the advantages of systematic household operations:

"A budget quickly locates the leaks. Some of us were buying candy, having clothes pressed, and getting shoe-shines. The budget is the only means of knowing how much we may spend for something we want without having to do without something we want more." (C. B., Indiana.)

"At the end of five years of married life we were without any savings. At the end of ten years, with four children in the family, we have a $6,000 home, thanks to the budget plan." (L. T. K., Illinois.)

"For several years I refused to bother with a budget, thinking, as many other women have done, that we could not possibly live more economically; but after using the budget system, I discovered that, while our expenses remained the same, our comforts increased.

"The budget has taught me to serve nourishing, simple, well-cooked food. It has taught me that home dressmaking is not only a necessity, but a pleasure and an art. We spend $39 a month on food, $40 on shelter, $24.40 on clothing, $21.50 on operating expenses, $21 on development, and $20.60 on insurance — total, $166.50. (N. R. C., Colorado.)

"For two years my husband received $250 a month. But beginning with the new year, his salary was reduced to $200. We had never kept a budget as there had always been enough money to buy the things we had to have, with sometimes a little over to add to our savings account. I found that in December our expenses were $247.26, $47.26 more than we would have to spend in the following month. Plainly something had to be done, and we did it. We rearranged our budget by cutting down on operating expenses, saving on light and eliminating laundry bills. The groceries were reduced about $10. I baked our bread for the first time in years. I feel no worse physically for my effort, and mentally I feel quite exhilarated. It was a jolt, but it knocked us out of a rut. My husband and I both feel that the financial loss is only temporary, but we hope our ability to live within a stated income is not temporary." (H. C.M., Oklahoma.)

Sample budgets may be secured from insurance companies, banks, and department stores. These should be adapted to the particular needs of the family and then followed conscientiously. While the various professions and occupations make an absolute, rigid and uniform distribution of funds for all families impossible, the following items of expenditure should be found in every household budget: Shelter (either rent or the payment of mortgage, interest, up-keep, etc., 15—20 per cent; food, 20-25 per cent; clothing (including purchase, cleaning, and repairs), 15 per cent; household operation including gas, electricity, telephone, laundry, supplies, etc.), 9—10 per cent; health and recreation (vacation, entertainment), 5 per cent; taxes and insurance, 5 per cent; mental advancements (including books, magazines, lectures, school), 5 per cent; savings, 10 per cent; church and charitable contributions and gifts, 10 per cent.

The last two items call for further emphasis. In meeting the requirement for systematic thrift, a good rule requires that as a minimum 10 per cent of the family income be deposited regularly in a reliable bank. The iron and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie said that the foundation of his large fortune was laid through the habit he started when as a young man he resolved to save one dollar out of every five earned

Of course, emergencies will arise in which the 10-per-cent savings program cannot be maintained; but where the will to win is marked by the willingness to sacrifice some items in the long catalog of non-essentials, this thrift program, under divine blessing, will become a reality.

Financial irresponsibility is attacked in the Scriptures. With all his almost fabulous wealth Solomon has immortalized some very workable principles for the maintenance of economic soundness in the home. When he writes, "He that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough" (Prov. 28:19), we cannot dismiss his words without thinking of the modern parade of vanity promoted by extravagance. When he warns, "Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well to thy herds, for riches are not forever" (Prov. 27:23), the insanitv of America's speculation craze looms up before us with its neglect of hard labor and its will-o'-the-wisp of easy money. When he summarizes: "There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man spendeth it up," he explains the Damocles sword of debts and duns over improvident families.

The other item on our Christian family budget which distinguishes it from the usual run of planned finance is the provision for a ten-per-cent contribution to Church and charity. Proportionately few Christian homes maintain this high percentage; and it is in no spirit of legalism and in no desire to enforce the Old Testament tithe that it is suggested here. If "God loveth a cheerful giver" (2 Cor. 9:7), particular affection must be bestowed upon a home in which liberal gifts for the Kingdom show a proper recognition of His many blessings. The family that curtails its church contributions and Christian charity to a small fraction of its expenditure for amusements, clothing, and personal adornments will inevitably find, unless the gracious forbearance of God intervenes, that such half-hearted, trivial gifts restrict the bestowal of blessings. On the other hand, the young husband and wife who from the wedding-day lay aside a definite and liberal sum for their Savior and their fellow-men (it may be more than 10 per cent in prosperous homes) will find in this generous stewardship one of their greatest assets. Offerings brought in a spirit of gratitude to God for His unspeakable Gift bear out the apostle's promise, "He which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully" (2 Cor. 9:6). This generous harvest may not always be computed in terms of human success; but there is a spiritual ingathering, precious beyond all price, to be reaped both in time and in eternity by those who share their prosperity with God. Not the least of these blessings can be the contentment of a Christian home, the love binding Christian parents to Christian children, and the radiant immanence of the redeeming Christ.

#### PARTNERS IN FAMILY FINANCE

In the happy comradeship of a marriage hallowed by Christian devotion the problems and opportunities of family finances are met by cooperative partnership. Probably one of the most provocative causes of domestic troubles is the niggardly refusal of the husband to supply adequate support for the maintenance of the household. The wife who is constantly driven to beg or wheedle the few dollars necessary for home purposes has become a beggar in her own house-hold. The services she renders her husband would demand a compensation on the open labor market far in excess of the total sum which is at her disposal every month. An ardent champion of those victimized by penurious husbands claims that the bridegroom receives about $385 worth of service a month from his bride. He offers this computation: "This fortunate lord of creation has in one woman a cook ($75 a month and keep); a chambermaid-waitress ($75 a month and keep); a valet ($100 a month and keep) ; a laundress ($40 a month); and a seamstress (who easily eats up four days a month at $5 a day, or a total of $20). After his children come, this excellent female Friday becomes also a governess-nurse, without relinquishing her other duties. As servant to the children, she represents $75 a month and food." Dr. John B. Leeds, how-ever, in his book The Household Budget, shows that fifty house-wives, when questioned as to the value of their services, gave an average estimate of $53 a month. No matter at which figure we may place the true value of a faithful wife's services, she ought to be, in every sense of the term, a full, responsible partner in the financial affairs of the home.

Normally, of course, the husband should direct the household treasury, not because women are incapable of maintaining a sane and sound financial supervision, but because money matters are the natural responsibilities of his leadership. In many instances, of course, a level-headed wife may save the family from financial fall. Nathaniel Hawthorne owed not only much of his literary inspiration to his wife but also a good part of the practical opportunity for quiet composure: It has been said that, if it had not been for Sophia, crippled as she was, we would probably not now remember Nathaniel. After losing his position in the custom-house, he hardly knew how to face his wife with the news. To his utter amazement, however, she exclaimed exultingly: "Now you can write your book!" And when Hawthorne objected bitterly, "Yes; and what shall we live on while I am writing it?" this astonishing woman revealed an unsuspected money reserve. "Where on earth did you get that?" Hawthorne demanded. "My husband," she replied, "I have always known that you were a man of genius. I knew that some day you would write an immortal masterpiece; so every week, out of the money you have given me for house-keeping, I have saved something. Here is enough to last us one whole year." So, for the first time in his life, Hawthorne could write undisturbed. In this freedom he wrote his masterpiece, The Scarlet Letter.

Martin Luther, after twelve years of married life, wrote: "God be thanked, I have a pious and true wife, in whom the heart of a husband may trust. I count her dearer than the kingdom of France and the dukedom of Venice." As the great Reformer explained in his will, her devotion to him extended also to the varied affairs of his unusual household. Luther's salary as professor at the university was two hundred gulden. He had no other professional income, since he refused special fees for preaching, lecturing, and translation, saying: "God be thanked that I have kept the reputation of not taking money." To offset this, it is true, gifts of provisions, and other necessities, including clothing and money, were frequently sent to him. Yet the open door to his hospitable home led many monks and nuns who had escaped from monastic restrictions, persecuted preachers, indigent students, poor relatives, to go in and out his lodging as though it were a public inn. At one time the Luther home housed thirteen nephews and nieces, eighteen children altogether. Besides, many visitors flocked to Luther, and some of them stayed in the parsonage for several years. Once the guests and visitors who sought help were so numerous that Luther wrote, "I was utterly overwhelmed by the crowds of poor people who come here from far and near as to an open house." When the Prince of Anhalt planned a visit to Wittenberg so as to enjoy a closer acquaintance with Luther, a friend wrote him that he should by no means plan to stay with Luther because his house was stuffed with an overflow of students, maidens, widows, and romping children. At the end of his third married year his generosity had forced him to incur debts to a total of one hundred gulden, and he was compelled to pawn three expensive gift chalices. When his salary was raised to three hundred gulden, his hospitality increased proportionately; and in all this it was his wife Katherine who superintended the little farm, raised flowers, fruit-trees, grape-vines, managed the meals, kept the domestic books balanced and, with all, memorized Scripture-passages.

Happy homes are built by mutual devotion and cooperative help; but when a wife seeks to retain her financial independence after the wedding or in the back-to-the-office-after-marriage philosophy maintains her own bank account and advocates a fifty-fifty plan for expenses, the feeling of life partnership has been sacrificed, the interdependence of husband and wife has vanished and the break-up of the home seems less formidable than it should.

Financial team-work, circumspect purchasing, systematic thrift, disciplined desires, and simplified standards of living are particularly necessary in these financially insecure years. Only in this way can there be "oil in the dwelling of the wise." Under the reign of improvidence, heedless squandering, and hand-to-mouth financing it is only a matter of marking time until the oil gives out and the dark of destitution spreads its pall of despair.

### OWN YOUR OWN

Every man under his vine and under his fig-tree - 1 Kings 4:25

It is a far cry from Babylon's Ishtar Street in the sixth pre-Christian century to the sophistication of Park Avenue in present-day Manhattan. In comparison with the gilded apartments that raise their aristocratic penthouses to dizzy heights above the sidewalks of New York's wealthy boulevard, the clumsy adobe structures that fringed the streets of Nebuchadnezzar's capital seem hopelessly crude and uncouth. Even with the highly colored baked-enamel lions and the grotesque griffins by which the Akkadian architects sought to relieve the monotony of Mesopotamian walls, these Babylonian boulevards could not compete with the thoroughfare that still boasts of more millionaires than all England.

Yet in one significant feature Ishtar Street was notably more substantial than Park Avenue. As the researches of the late Prof. D. D. Luckenbill of the University of Chicago disclose, 80 per cent of the Babylonian families owned their own homes. Self-indulgent moderns may point to our luxurious apartments with their gilded salons and their Roman baths; our suites de luxe may embody the last word in comfort and refinement; yet the Babylonians prided themselves in something more essential: their cuneiform real-estate deeds, so carefully stored away that thousands of property titles have withstood the ravages of centuries, assure us that four out of every five families in Babylonia could say of their home, as unpretentious as it was, "This is ours."

#### FINANCIAL ATTRACTIONS OF HOME-OWNERSHIP

With all social progress we have not been able to reach this percentage of home-ownership in our nation. However, it is gratifying to note that, according to the 1930 census, among 29,904,663 families in the United States there was a larger proportion of home-owners than in the previous decennial tabulations. This remarkable growth may be presented statistically as follows: In 1910, 9,083,711 families, or 44.8 per cent of the national total, owned their homes; in 1920, 10,866,960 families, or 44.6 per cent; in 1930, 14,002,074 families, or 46.8 per cent. The National Emergency Council pointed out that the 1934 home-mortgage debt in the United States is $21,000,000,000, the second largest single class of long-term indebtedness in the country. It is exceeded only by the Federal debt itself.

While less than half of our families own the buildings in which they live, the instinctive urge for home-ownership should live as strongly in American hearts as it ever did in the breast of any Babylonian. Direct advantages, tangible and intangible, come with the possession of a dwelling. Not the least of these are the varied financial attractions. It has been said, "More people have started on the road to financial independence through home-owner-ship than in any other way." An investment in a house carefully purchased and properly financed should be at least as good as a savings account and better than the $3,263,949,000 in deposits held in the 4,835 American banks that failed between October 31, 1929, and August 31, 1932. The cash equity in a wisely purchased house offers a feeling of security and financial independence. While the postwar years revealed the tragedy of frenzied finance, especially the purchase of overpriced stocks and bonds (they lost seventy-four billion dollars in value within less than three years), they illustrated even more strikingly why a well-financed home constitutes real estate.

When newly-weds make the first payment on their home, they accept the obligation of a mortgage, with a schedule of stiff payments; but as compensation they have the prospect of definite savings. A family can occupy, and pay for, a home at a cost only slightly more than the rental of an apartment of corresponding size; and when the payments have been completed, the home-owner is financially far ahead of the apartment-dweller. While the installments are being paid, the habits of thrift are systematically inculcated, and frequently there is the attraction of additional income. Often an income-bringing garage can be built on the lot, a portion of the house can be rented, or similar sources of income developed.

The epidemic of foreclosures that terrified the country, particularly since 1931, during which patient, plodding owners sacrificed a large portion of their life's earnings in the loss of their homes, may seem to contradict some of the roseate expectations attached to home-ownership. These tragedies, however, were consequent upon the fictitious values and the inflated prices that held sway in that reign of quick and easy money. Property was purchased far too expensively and financed on shoe-string policies that demanded mortgaging of the family income for an almost indefinable number of years. The Federal Housing Administration has analyzed the home-purchasing practices of the boom years 1922-1929 and has found these three principal evils: 1) the purchase of homes through second mortgages financed at exorbitant costs; 2) the excessive fees, in addition to high rates of interest, demanded for the renewal of maturing mortgages; 3) the practice of issuing loans on a fictitious, short-term basis, when the intention of both the lender and the borrower is to refinance the mortgage at the expiration of the period, with no provision for the gradual reduction of the mortgage from the income of the home-owner.

Today conditions governing the purchase of a home have vastly improved; values are genuine and Federal aid and financial regulation will help to minimize foreclosures. In the past, mortgages loomed before the average home-owner as a perpetual burden. By the provision of the Federal Housing Administration a young couple can build its home under the most attractive terms and with the best security home-purchasers have ever enjoyed. Among the features of the FHA plan (according to Form 2359) are: 1) lower financing charges; 2) long-term loans, extending in some cases up to 20 or 25 years; 3) advancement by the lender of a large part of the total value (up to 80 or 90 per cent, if circumstances warrant) ; 4) repayment in monthly installments, about like rent, suited to the borrower's income; 5) inclusion of taxes, assessments and fire insurance in the monthly payment; 6) elimination of monthly mortgages and the need for periodic and costly refinancing; 7) protection of the lender by a system of mutual mortgage insurance; 8) improvement of housing standards and conditions.

A house selected on the advice of competent realtors and then purchased and financed on these conservative lines is still a triple-A investment.

#### MORE THAN DREAMS OF PROFIT

Yet it was not the dream of possible profit that lay at the bottom of those really successful households which, in the words of Ex-President Hoover, have made of the American home "the sanctuary of our loftiest ideals, a source of the spiritual energy of our people." The hope for a 1,000-per-cent appreciation in land value could never be the basis for that love of home which Longfellow eulogizes as being "interwoven with all that is pure and deep and lasting in earthly affections. Let us wander where we may, the heart looks back with secret longing to the paternal roof. There the scattered rays of affection concentrate. Time may enfeeble them, distance overshadow them, and the storms of life obstruct them for a season; but they will at length break through the cloud and storm and glow and burn and brighten around the peaceful threshold of home."

Merle Thorpe, editor of The Nation's Business, emphasizes some of the less tangible blessings that come with a family-owned home. He writes: "Both my wife and I were reared in homes owned by our parents. Our children have been reared in homes owned by their parents. In each case the ownership of the home contributed greatly to the well-being of the family. My experience has demonstrated that there is truth in the statement that the ownership of a comfortable home is a great source of happiness and that it ranks immediately after health and a good conscience. I believe that family stamina, family pride, family culture, and economic well-being are fostered when the family is its own landlord." The social background for the entire family; the playground space for the children, where they can romp without criticism; the moral independence of a life lived without interferences from an outside owner; the absence of restriction on the size of a family; the opportunities for individual expression, both within and without the home, all combine to emphasize the advantages of proprietorship.

Besides, a home-owner usually acquires business acumen and a sense of obligation to his community, which seeks expression in civic and municipal affairs. The permanency found in the environment of one's own home helps to establish contacts with neighbors, whose friendships will last for years. Perhaps it was the realization of this solidarity that prompted a progressive Chicago manufacturer to give $500 to each employee who had established a home-purchasing fund of the same amount. "A man who owns his own home," he claimed, "is worth $500 more to his employer than one who does not."

Social workers, juvenile-court judges, and police-matrons are emphatic in their assertions that the benefits of home-owning are not restricted to the first generation, but that there is a connection, incidental perhaps, but nevertheless real, between the ratio of juvenile crime and the title to the home. The opinion of Judge Francis B. Allegretti of the Chicago Boys' Court is significant: "Home-ownership on the part of more parents would stimulate parental care and attention and reduce offenses among juveniles, because lack of parental care causes by far the greater number of delinquencies among our youth. There cannot be an atmosphere of love, devotion, loyalty, and obedience in a residence where privacy is almost out of the question and room is at a premium."

Judge S. D. Murphy, who occupies a similar position in Birmingham courts, reports: "Eighty-seven per cent of the young delinquents of Jefferson County, Alabama, the seat of my juris-diction, come from habitats that do not belong to their parents. Behind home-ownership are some of the most desirable human qualities — love, ambition, thrift, personal and civic pride, all of which are fostered in the act of buying, or building, or paying for, a home. The child who must play on the city streets may be more apt to meet up with gangs; he may be more susceptible to activities that end in delinquency than the child who can expend his energies out in the open spaces in his own back yard."

#### OPPOSING ATTITUDES

More than ever before, for well-known reasons, newly married couples are obliged to live with the parents of either husband or wife. This arrangement of course is far from ideal and should be adopted only under the stress of extreme emergency. Marriage could well be postponed for six months or a year if this delay would obviate the necessity of living under the parental roof. There the young couple is too constantly under the surveillance of those whose attitudes are necessarily different and sometimes, because of the disparity in ages, even contradictory. In a shared home, friction can too easily arise between the competing requirements of filial and marital devotion. Husband and wife may find their sense of mutual responsibility weakened, their domestic sensibilities atrophied, and their shiny dreams of wedded bliss tarnished. If restricted income demands this makeshift, let it be regarded •as a temporary expedient, to be supplanted, as soon as improved conditions permit, by normal, independent home-life.

Other trends in our modern philosophy of life are similarly directed toward weakening this "Own your own" ideal. We can pass by the hotel that tries to recoup business by offering attractive rates to married couples with complete emancipation from every obligation of cooking and cleaning. Such arrangements as well as the furnished-room plan, which because of its low cost makes a special appeal to some newly-weds, are not normally attractive to the average husband and wife. Much more pleasing — and proportionately more fatal to the ideal here set forth — is the apartment-house, with the glamor of its various "services" and its escape from many domestic duties. Under economic pressure one- or two-room apartments have been regarded with particular favor. They make it easier for the wife to continue her work, and they permit a maximum of time for outside purposes. Further, such "homes" are regarded as the least expensive and generally the most convenient start in married life. And finally a certain swanky atmosphere envelops the modern apartment.

These are highly questionable advantages. The independent business career of the apartment-house wife is often directly contributory to the blight of childlessness, which, in turn, characterizes most cases of divorce. Jurists and students of sociology tell us that, wherever the home ties are so few that the family belongings may be packed in a few suitcases and placed in the rumble seat of the sport roadster, the home has lost its stability and may quickly be broken up. Department stores, recognizing this ephemeral home-life, exert more than usual precaution in extending credit to these modern "cliff-dwellers." With all the alleged economic lure we have still to meet the couple that has attained to financial prominence by the apartment-house, no-child route.

We realize of course that the modern apartment will constitute an increasingly alluring prospect. The multiple home units built by the Swedish government, the modern family structures erected in large German cities, and the imposing architecture with which well-directed city-planning and philanthropy transform sections of New York City's lower East Side Ghetto are marvels of efficient construction. Their open areas planted with grass, flowers, and trees permit the free play of light and air on all sides. Chromium steel, unusual effects in brick and stone, colored tiling, and modern architecture combine to present pleasing exteriors, the attractiveness of which is reflected in ingenious interiors. Even the roofs of these family sky-scrapers, we are told, are arranged with a view of making an attractive impression on airplane passengers.

The house on wheels, commonly known as the trailer, introduces a new deterrent to home-ownership. At the beginning of 1936 about one third of a million Americans lived in trailers. If Roger Babson is correct, by 1956 one half of our population will be housed in these portable homes. The undeniable attractions that this mode of living may offer to those afflicted by the Wanderlust cannot be denied. Instead of "Own your own" many young couples have adopted the slogan "Ride your own." Yet as this motorized Gipsy life becomes more popular, it will offer complex family problems.

Nevertheless the individual home, its independence, its freedom for personal development, will continue to hold out the higher hope for happiness. Home-ownership of course is no guarantee against family misfortune; for there can often be harmonious understanding within the cramped quarters of an apartment, where happy families triumph over their environment. Neither is the title to a house, even a house entirely unencumbered by mortgage, in itself a pledge of domestic tranquillity. Yet a home purchased and financed with careful planning and a willingness to sacrifice will, under the blessing of God, normally help to fulfil some of our happiest ideals. It may not assume pretentious proportions, but it will help emphasize one of earth's great happinesses — the thrill of ownership, the assurance of possession.

#### THE ACQUISITION OF A HOME

Only proportionately few couples will be able to start wedded life in possession of a home. But where there is a determined, intelligent, prayerful will, the proverbial way can usually be found.

Recently an organization of realtors sponsored a nation-wide competition that required a discussion of the intriguing theme "How I Acquired My Home." From the mass of 2,000 amazingly human documents which this contest called forth instances like the following are characteristic of the experiences in many American families:

"In Marshall, Virginia, a husband who was a day-laborer and not regularly employed and a wife who took in sewing laid by ten-cent pieces, quarters, and sometimes half dollars and in this way saved enough to buy a home."

"A man who is now a school-teacher in Oak Park, Illinois, came to Chicago penniless with a wife and children. They greatly desired a home and undertook to buy one on the West Side. This man became a manual-training teacher at a low salary. In order to make the payments on the small house, he was forced to sell dust-cloths from door to door on his way to school. He made all the furniture after hours in his manual training classroom and carted it home himself, eight miles, on a wheelbarrow because he could not afford to have it sent any other way. He finally paid for his home and in later years sold it. The proceeds bought a fine $35,000 home, in which they now reside. The father says that he would not have this home now had he not secured the first one in spite of such hardships."

"A young man in Worcester, Massachusetts, confronted with the problem of providing a home for his widowed mother and two children, had his whole life changed in effecting the solution. Until he was faced with this responsibility, he had stayed away from home every night and spent his surplus money on the cinema and other forms of entertainment. When he undertook the home-purchasing project, he had to cut down on such expenditures, and he found a great deal of time on his hands after work. He became interested in good books, took a course in engineering, was graduated, and found a new happiness in life."

"Equally interesting is the story of two sisters who came to the Land of Promise from Belgium a few years ago. They operated a tiny beauty parlor, and from its modest profits they purchased an $8,000 home."

"Other letters tell of a mail-carrier, making $1,500 a year, who built his own domicile; of a widow in Jackson, Michigan, who started out with ten dollars earned by domestic work and provided a home of her own for herself and her two children; of a Clevelander who purchased from the savings of a relatively small salary, borrowed $2,000 on it, and with this capital started a successful business of his own."

"Quite parallel to many of these achievements is the story of Mr. and Mrs. John McGill of Saint Louis, reported in the Post-Dispatch magazine of that city. With savings totaling less than $250, but with boundless energy and determination, they set about building their own home, remodel. ing an ancient two-room cottage, cementing their own cellar, installing their own wiring, papering their own walls, all with unlimited expenditure of effort, but with a startling minimum of monetary outlay. As the value of the property appreciated, it was possible to finance the whole plan by paying twenty-seven dollars a month."

One of the few private houses in New York City that have withstood the almost ruthless invasion of apartment houses and commercial buildings is occupied by Judge Morgan J. O'Brien, Justice of the New York Supreme Court. In a remarkable story he relates that he bought this spacious home by saving five-cent pieces. When his first salary started, he used to walk home instead of riding. The nickels which he saved in this way and through other economies he deposited in a box marked "Home." When the number of his legal clients grew and his income increased, he was able to save in much greater amounts. 'But as he specifically states, had it not been for the five-cent pieces with which this reserve fund began, he could not have purchased the home.

For a young man and a young woman who start together on the road to wedded happiness the purchase of a home should be a prime concern, because the cottage or bungalow that is paid for with the accumulation of slow and systematic savings or carefully financed with regular installments, creates and fosters ideals which often are otherwise unapproachable. Young people should lay well-formed plans for the acquisition of their own homes. Let them give up the luxuries, forego the pride of owning an auto-mobile, sacrifice expensive clothing. Instead let them save an extra dollar every week, work a little harder for a home that in a very personal sense is to be their own.

May not this ideal be implied in the Scriptural phrase picturing the peace and prosperity of Israel in its golden age, "every man under his vine and under his fig-tree" (1 Kings 4:25)? May we not assume that this is the house delineated in that hymn of domestic happiness which sings the blessings of a God-fearing husband: "Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house; thy children like olive-plants round about thy table. Behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord" (Ps. 128:3, 4) ?

#### "BLESS THIS HOUSE"

A splendid custom, still perpetuated in Europe, dedicates a new home by invoking the blessing of God on its threshold. If we pause to remind ourselves that we spend more time within the walls of our home than in any other single locality, it will be apparent that we need the divine benediction there more constantly than elsewhere. Elaborate rituals have been prepared for this ceremony, but we need only a simple, sincere act of worship combining praise and prayer, thanksgiving and petition.

Daily the physical and spiritual welfare of the family should be brought before God. A suitable prayer for one's home is found in these lines, adapted from Helen Taylor:

Bless this house, O Lord, we pray.
Make it safe by night and day;
Bless these walls, so firm and stout,
Keeping want and trouble out;
Bless the roof and chimneys tall,
Let Christ's peace lie over all;
Bless this door that it may prove
Open e'er to joy and love.

Bless these windows shining bright,
Letting in God's heav'nly light;
Bless the hearth a-blazing there,
With smoke ascending like a prayer;
Bless the folk who dwell within,
Keep them pure and free from sin;
Bless us all that one day we
May, O Jesus, dwell with Thee.

### QUICKSAND COUNSEL

Is counsel perished? - Jer. 49:7

Is there a widening breach between young people and the clergy? Some indications suggest a disturbing answer. In a questionnaire sent to eighty-eight Protestant youth groups in churches of ten different denominations one question asked pointedly: "Do you feel you can go to your minister with your intimate personal problems?" More than two thirds answered in the negative.

It would be folly to deduce sweeping conclusions on the basis of this percentage. In my Church, confirmation instruction and the opportunities for friendly pastoral help afforded by the announcements for Communion combine to increase the confidence which our young people place in their spiritual leaders. Yet even here, in the more personal issues of courtship and marriage, we find that the pastor's direction is often discarded in much the same manner as parental counsel is neglected.

Too often the answers to the questions of the heart are sought from counselors whose decisions may lead to matrimonial debacle. Here is a young woman in need of advice for the perplexities of her private life. Here is a young husband awakening to the possibility of imminent discord, yet yearning for restored harmony. Here is a couple pausing eagerly on the threshold of married life, searching for the key to the portals of domestic bliss. And where do they try to find the assurance of happiness or the path to deeper mutual understanding?

#### NEWSPAPER COUNSELORS

Not a few young people are ready to bare their private affairs to strangers and to have crisis issues of their lives decided not by parents or pastor but by the pronouncements of newspaper counselors whom they have never seen. Consider, for example, the activities of "Dorothy Dix." She is said to receive an average of 500 letters a day. While this may be press-agent exaggeration, her philosophies of love and her advice in domestic problems are syndicated in 150 newspapers, with a daily circulation approaching 20,000,000. Or think of "Beatrice Fairfax," who claims, "In the last ten years I have read a million letters." Her newspapers call her "the nation's preeminent counselor on social decorum and on personal problems." She has become a sort of Delphic oracle, whose opinion has been sought, we are told, in as many as 800 letters in one day.

There can be no doubt that many who find themselves confronted by conflict have no parental guide or friendly adviser to whom they can turn. Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt tells her magazine audiences: "It is hard to find just the friend we should like to talk to. Often it is easier to write to some one whom we do not expect ever to see. We can say things which we cannot say to the average individual we meet in our daily lives." Newspaper columnists have not been slow to seize upon this White House en-dorsement. Doris Blake, the professional confidante employed by the Chicago Tribune, says that Mrs. Roosevelt's attitude expresses exactly her own psychology. She insists: The fact "that confidences are respected, viewed sympathetically no matter what the problem, advised upon to the very best of our ability, makes departments like this one just that friend with whom you may safely discuss your troubles."

Yet when this counsel is commercialized, — and it usually is in newspaper features, - it becomes basically objectionable. Some of these self-enthroned arbiters are disqualified by their own marital experiences. A Mid-Western newspaper counselor in questions of the home found that she had been dealing with apid theories when her own daughter left town in a blaze of scandal to adopt a short-lived career as bandit. A noted "authority" on questions of the home and domestic management lives in a luxurious hotel in the nation's capital. A Chicago "love professor" and author of a correspondence course entitled "The Master-key to Love" was sued for divorce after a three months' marriage. His abused wife charged that the "professor" struck her thirteen times at one occasion and knocked her through three doorways.

In addition to the cheapness involved in baring intimate heart secrets to an utter stranger who receives money for listening, the direction offered by this craft of counselors often becomes a Fata Morgana that lures marriages on the reefs.

An example of Dorothy Dix's advice and her support of divorce is given in the following question and answer from the St. Louis Star-Times:

"Dear Miss Dix: I am thirty-six. My wife is thirty-four. She is a beautiful woman. I am a hopeless cripple from an incurable case of arthritis. My wife had to go out to work, and we were so poor that she lost several positions because she was so shabbily dressed. She has met a wealthy business man, and they have fallen violently in love with each other. She has gone to live with him, and of course he gives her every luxury and wants to marry her. A week ago she came to me and begged me to give her a divorce, told me that, if I would, plenty of money would be supplied me, and I would be placed in a home for incurables. She said that, whether or not I gave her the divorce, she would continue to live with this man, as she loved him better than life. I flew into a rage and told her I would never give her a divorce. But what do you think I should do? — BROKEN-HEARTED."

Answer.—"In judging your wife, you must look at the from her point of view, and that is pitiful, too. Life was hard on her also. It was grinding poverty and exhausting work. It was shabbiness and poor food and anxiety about where the rent was to come from and the food for the next day and nursing a sick, man. No play. No amusement. No gaiety. None of the luxuries and pretty things that women love.

"And she saw this drab and dreary life stretching on for years and years to the end of the chapter. Then this man came along who offered her all of the things she craved — the ease, the comfort, the soft living, the freedom from worry about money. And she was beautiful, and she knew that her good looks would soon go in the slavery she was condemned to, and she was not strong enough to resist the temptation. She did not love you enough; for love is proof against any temptation, however great.

"It was a heartless thing for her to leave you; but it was her life against yours, her happiness against yours, and selfishness won.

"As for what you should do, I think the answer is plain. Give her the divorce she wants and let her legalize her position. You have lost her anyway, and denying her a divorce will be only a petty revenge that will bring you no happiness. And you will have made the gallant gesture of a fine gentleman. – Dorothy Dix

With not a word about sin, the moral and legal condemnation of this divorce, or the sense of loyalty that the Church tries to inspire in Christian wives, this type of newspaper counsel fears neither God nor hell and helps pull the props from the pedestal on which the Scriptures have exalted marriage.

Snatches of the advice which Miss Dix gives to her correspondents on other subjects follow:

"I think that before any young couples marry, they should make a contract in which it would be definitely set forth what proportion of the property the woman is to receive in case of divorce."

"The real cure for divorce is not law nor moral teachings. In the great majority of cases it is simply a railroad or steamship ticket. Nothing else."

"Marriage is a gamble in which you pay your money and take a chance."

"Why unhappy wives stick is a big mystery."

"There are many reasons why the marriage of convenience should have a better chance of lasting than the marriage of love."

"Make a man comfortable, and he will purr like a cat under your hand. Give him a warm hearthstone, and he will not wander from it. Believe me, my daughter, there is no other such recipe for keeping a husband from becoming a philander than to fatten him up and cause him to lose that boyish figure."

A new departure in this counsel-for-marriage move is the newspaper mentor who claims to base his advice on scientific and professional investigations. Typical of this tendency is Dr. Albert C. Wiggam. His mental tests are syndicated throughout the country and he deals largely with questions of marriage and courtship. An examination of his statements shows an evident desire to disrupt accepted beliefs. The Scriptures are entirely set aside, and the attitude of the Church is made the object of innuendo. recent pronouncements of this scientific oracle we find the following questions and answers, which speak unmistakably for themselves:

"Is man naturally polygamous? — Yes. ... However, his sheer intelligence and social position have led him to domesticate himself."

"Is a woman justified in breaking her engagement if her intended will not agree just how the money questions will be answered after marriage? – Yes"

"Do men like the pursuing type of women? - Men do not altogether like to be pursued, but it is part of the world-wide revolt of women to secure independent individuality."

"Should young people with small incomes marry or work and save and wait? — Marry as soon as you are sure that two pay-envelopes will stretch over the rent, food, clothes, and a little recreation."

Whenever a man earns his livelihood by dealing in alleged scientific advice on personal issues, his statements should be scrutinized with exceeding care. When his recommendations involve outspoken opposition to the Scriptures and indulge in "wisecracks" against the Christian religion, his efforts are directly hostile to public welfare and common morality.

#### MEDICAL COUNSELORS

More dangerous are the medical counselors, whose ranks have swollen into formidable proportions. Contrary to the accepted medical ethics these men have adopted programs of lurid advertising, featuring handbills with scare-line warnings, almanacs, and' street guides interlarded with health talks, professional cards offering the special inducement of reduced prices. All these are freely distributed in the attempt to create a psychology of fear and to lure the unwary into "medical institutes."

It can be shown that some of these "physicians" have secured their medical title through the grinding of diploma mills, as revealed a few years ago in St. Louis. Their blatant publicity, colored as it is with benevolent claims, makes them professional outcasts. The best advice they suggest can be given much more scientifically, sincerely, and reasonably by the family physician.

Some years ago the Chicago Tribune featured detailed exposés of these medical quacks. Summarizing its investigation, the newspaper stated:

"The Tribune has found them [these advertising "specialists' to be organized, backed by ample funds, and buttressed behind expensive legal talent. It has also found much evidence to indicate that their claims of curing diseases are founded largely on buncombe and that their profession is, in fact, that genial, age-old profession of getting money by false pretenses.

"Evidence is in the possession of the Tribune which goes to show that the confidence-men 'specialists' are guilty of graver offenses than the mere petty grafting brought to light. These facts substantiate the fol. lowing charges:

"That the pocket of a patient was picked by a 'doctor' while the patient was on the operating-table.

"That some of the quacks are at least morally and probably legally guilty of killing patients.

"That a number of the quacks have maimed patients for life by malpractice.

"That at least one of the quacks habitually attempts to seduce his women patients.

"That two of the quacks operate their business under assumed names and, living double lives, practice swindling down-town, while posing as respectable doctors in outlying districts.

"The investigators of the Tribune were chosen with a view to using only such men as were perfectly well. To make certain on this point, each investigator, before beginning his work, underwent a careful examination by a competent physician. It was thus made certain that, when the investigators left the Tribune, they were in perfect physical condition. The investigators went directly from the Tribune to the 'specialists' to whom they were assigned. There they were a good deal astonished to learn that they were suffering from various forms of venereal disease. Diagnoses were made in other cases after examinations which seemed aimed not at arriving at the physical condition of the caller but at frightening him into the belief that there was something the matter with him."

In the course of the investigation the shocking extremes to which these charlatans sometimes drive their victims were uncovered. The following is a typical case:

"Here is an example of the awful influence which the quack doctors exercise on the ignorant immigrants of Chicago. The facts, names, and dates were given to the Tribune by officers of the Visiting Nurses' Association. The names are omitted for obvious reasons. A Polish family, living on Archer Avenue, besides the mother and father was composed of ten healthy, ambitious children. The oldest of the children were twin boys, twenty-three years old. One of the twins led a clean, healthy life and was a fine type of physical strength and energy. He brought his pay-envelope home regularly and was frequently promoted by the firm with which he worked.

"One day the son had a dizzy spell. He read an advertisement in one of the foreign newspapers. He went to see a quack doctor in the neighborhood where he lived. The youth had but one interview with the doctor. It lasted only a few minutes. But during that time the doctor impressed a belief on the mind of the healthy boy that he had a horrible disease which would take three years and much money to cure. The boy went home resolved to take his life. He could not bear the expense of the 'treatment' and did not wish to expose his family to the danger of contracting the disease. He became so obsessed with the dread of the disease that he slept in a room by himself, would not come near any of his family, ate alone, and, having washed his own eating utensils, would lock them in a drawer.

"The family physician was asked by the mother to make an examination of the boy. The doctor reported that he was in fine physical condition and there was nothing at all the matter with him. Not convinced, the boy went to six reputable physicians, all of whom told him the quack had lied to get his money. But they could not drive the obsession from the boy's mind. No word from expert authority could beat the idea out of his head which the quack had put in it. He refused to visit any of his relatives or go near them for fear of spreading the contagion. The quack had told him that by having the disease he was endangering his family as well as himself, and this idea the boy stuck to. He broke off an engagement with his sweetheart and, without explaining why, refused to see her again. The family physician became alarmed at the mental condition of the boy and decided the only thing to do was to have another physician examine him and tell him he really had the disease he feared. It was arranged with another physician that the boy should be given some harmless pills after the incorrect diagnosis and was to pay $1 a week until he was 'cured' — mentally cured. The boy seemed somewhat relieved after this ruse was sprung. He took the medicine regularly for several weeks. One morning he was found dead in his bed. He had taken poison. He left a note, saying he could not bear to bring his family into disgrace by his own imprudence." (Nostrums and Quackery, pp. 432 and 433.)

Closely related in its violations of decency is the medical motion-picture that features the origin of life, hygienic issues, and other intimate subjects. Commenting on a screen exhibition in the Chicago Loop, published as "the only true scientific exposé of marriage ever shown," an investigating reporter finds that the promoter, whose "message" is the calculated center of these exhibitions, has an unsavory past with a police record, although imposingly labeled as president of the National Society of Eugenics. "His 'message' is so appallingly crude and nastily nauseating," a reviewer writes, "that at first the stronger-stomached of the audience are inclined toward lusty laughter. However, they gradually succumb to the wizardry of his eloquence, until at the end they are whipped into a frenzy of morbid sensationalism. At that point comes the high-powered salesmanship. Three paper pamphlets dealing with the mating instinct and other problems appertaining thereto are produced and sold for a dollar a set."

The Journal of the American Medical Association (March 2, 1932), investigating this professedly philanthropic lecturer, found that in 1929 New York State authorities forced him to drop the title of "Doctor"; that in 1930 he was arrested in New Orleans on serious charges, but had his case nolle-prossed under the condition that he leave the city immediately; that the booklets which he sells for fifty cents should not cost more than one cent each.

It is hardly necessary to warn intelligent young people against these atrocious illustrated lectures as well as against all anatomy exposures, origin-of-life shows, and similar crudities that flourish brazenly in the midways of most expositions or in the less reputable sections of our cities. It is a caustic commentary on the grasping tendencies of city officials that this vulgar exhibitionism is permitted to thrive with municipal license and sanction. How much better this declaration by the British Board of Film Censors: "Since the inception of the British Board of Film Censors, seven years ago, films have from time to time been submitted for censorship of which it has been said they were produced for the purpose of influencing public opinion or enlisting sympathy on certain subjects. Such films have included the effects of certain diseases, contracted and hereditary, illegal operations, white slavery, race suicide, etc. The Board has consistently refused to issue their certificates for these films."

We need more municipal judges that take the attitude of Philip G. Gilliam, Denver magistrate, who declares: "Now and then a motion-picture is shown of the type commonly known as the sex picture. Such pictures are usually placed at the third-run theater and are advertised as being 'For Adults Only? Whenever these films are shown, there is usually a storm of protest to the authorities to have them stopped. When parties involved are brought into the municipal court for an ordinance prohibiting the showing of obscene pictures, they claim that there is a moral lesson involved and that the pictures are therefore educational. In my opinion these pictures are not educational. They are displayed always with an inference of evil. I personally do not think that the theater is the proper place for sex education. As long as I am on the municipal bench, I am going to have these pictures stopped."

#### SCIENTIFIC COUNSEL

By devoting an entire issue of its Annual (more than 270 pages) to the problems of youth in our country, the American Academy of Political and Social Science shows proper concern for one of the most fundamental issues of our days. In discussing the difficulties that confront youth in its vocational guidance, youth in relation to the Church, leisure time, politics and sports, youth and crime, health and mental hygiene, it analyzes some of the hazards that loom ominously before the nation's tomorrow.

Unfortunately, however, some of the presentations are plainly marked by pointed opposition to the Christian ideals and the principles of the Scriptures. This is particularly notable in the discussion entitled "Youth and Marriage. As we have come to expect of such sociological studies, the religious element is completely ignored. That the principles of Jesus Christ and the teachings of the true Christian Church can help young people to live more happily, to enjoy their married life more fully, to stand economic stress and the storm of adversity heroically and with greater sac-rifice, — of this there is not so much as a word.

Instead — and this is a vicious trend in modern sociology - we discover a deliberate rising up against those basic principles of purity and chastity which even plain pagan morality - not to mention the higher ethical elements of Christianity — demands. In this discussion of youth and marriage the writer calmly lists a number of cases in which the code of Christian marital morality is outraged. But these lapses are not treated as moral issues. The whole presentation seems to be oblivious of the fact that we have the Ten Commandments with their prohibition of adultery. Instead the writer, who is "Counselor at the Marriage Council, Philadelphia; Invitation Lecturer at Educational Institutions, the Y. W. C. A.; Vice-President of the Parents' Association of the Haverford Friends School," etc., etc. (all responsible positions in home guidance and family influence), questions the advisability of purity. Specifically she states, "The point made by ... young people of premarital experimentation... raises interesting questions as to the wisdom of dogmatic assertions in regard to chastity." It was bad enough twenty years ago when Russian atheists advanced theories of this kind; but when this program of impurity is condoned and extolled by an organization like the American Academy of Political and Social Science, it is time to protest.

It is shocking to read that "a broad-minded clergyman and physician" helped an unmarried young couple "in trouble" by suggesting a procedure which is contrary to the law and utterly opposed to our Christian morality. This glorification of the "broad-minded clergyman" as opposed to the "narrow-minded preacher" of the Word summarizes the contemptuous regard of some professional social counselors and emphasizes a clear disdain for Christianity as a constructive aid for purity.

The remedy suggested for marriage ills is likewise disappointing. "Those who win through successfully," we are told, "must be trained to accept psychologically what the great biologists have long recognized, namely, that the survival of the individual or of the species is determined to an important degree by the ability to adapt to a changing environment." Psychology and biology are thus to offer saving instruction to our day; but how the adaptation to changed environment is to be attained, how character is to be strengthened, so that these young people can practice self-denial and continence, — these pointed questions of courtship and marriage — are left unanswered.

Somewhat more than two years ago the American Committee on Maternal Welfare decided to make a motion-picture film which would combat "the almost universal ignorance of the problem of motherhood and childbirth." Soon after completion the film was reviewed in four pages of Life, the widely read weekly pictorial magazine.

A clash of conflicting opinions resulted. On the one hand, high officials in Government, education, and public health service offered unqualified endorsements. In Minneapolis a group made up of physicians and their wives, nurses, and medical students voted to endorse the film by a vote of 1,995 to 40. The editor of The Ladies Home Journal, which has been featuring material concerning childbirth, declared, "I want my ten-year-old daughter to see it." Miss Katharine Lenroot, chief of the Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor, wrote: "I heartily approve Life's action in publishing this sequence of pictures. In my opinion it may well be seen by children of adolescent age." On the other hand, police in many cities confiscated the copies of the magazine with these pictures and forbade their sale on the news-stands. Ministers and teachers in large numbers protested against the printing of these four pages of frankly revealing scenes.

We hold that this tendency to "tell all and show all" is not only powerless in character building and negligible in preventing disaster caused by ignorance; it may be definitely destructive. The pictures in Life in no way emphasized the glory of mother-hood. Stressing, as the magazine and the film do, only the biological side, they tend to create an aversion to motherhood.

Nor do we believe that a public magazine or a motion-picture house is the place to reveal these scenes from the most intimate moments of life. The same screen that shows sin, allurement, and seduction, or the same magazine that pictures nudities and caters to the stage, will not offer the proper environment for a presentation of a subject so personal and intimate.

#### THE COUNSEL OF SUPERSTITION

That misguided myriads seeking advice in matters of heart and home are trafficking in superstitions with dealers in the forbidden arts is evident from the flourish of the mystic - despite financial stringency and sluggish business. Never before have the purveyors of the occult been able to reap a $125,000,000-a-year harvest. Never before has New York City had 25,000 members of this unsavory guild, with a total annual income estimated at $25,000,000.

We may smile at the African superstitions expressed in the circular advertisement of a "Dr." C. D. Alexander of Brooklyn, who offers: "Spells of all kinds released and broken. Love-apples in all forms. High John, the Conqueror, Adam and Eve, Black Cats' Ankle Dust, and All Kinds of Highly Appreciated Roots and Herbs. Cash or Credit" and whose supplementary list of wares includes "Bringing-back Powders," designed to coax back a straying wife or husband, "Tying-down Powders," to make the object of one's affections more approachable. Yet let us not make the mistake of concluding that such superstition is restricted to the illiterate of the colored race!

In a large catalog published by a Chicago firm almost every page makes reference to charms and mystical methods for "at-tracting the opposite sex." Sacred Magical Art Talisman No. 18315, for example, called "a talisman for love," is described with these promises: "This talisman is said to be wonderfully efficacious in procuring success in love and affairs of the heart. It is related in an ancient manuscript that the nature of this talisman is to assist in procuring the love of women, to cause men to marry their acknowledged sweethearts, to pacify strife and contentions between those who love one anther, to appease anger and quarrels.' It is sought after by many who believe it helps to cause marriage, to procure love, and to obtain favor from the opposite sex."

The cultivation of superstition in courtship and marriage has found even collegiate endorsement. Dr. Donald Patterson, professor of psychology at Minnesota University, showed that large numbers of students in this school believed in various forms of fortune-telling. Similarly startling results were obtained by Dr. Otis D. Caldwell and Dr. Gerhard E. Lundeen at Columbia University.

Particularly dangerous is the ill-conceived advice of fortune-tellers. John Mulholland, first vice-president of the Society of American Magicians, who conducted a personal six-year survey of fortune-telling through the cities and towns of our country, claims that four out of every ten persons in the United States believe in fortune-telling and that two more out of every ten are willing to believe. He writes this sweeping condemnation: "Fortune-tellers and their kind break up more homes in the United States than any other one cause. People go to such persons to get answers to only two questions — questions about love and money. Fortune-tellers have found that plain matter-of-fact answers do not interest their clients; so they tell them their wife or husband is interested in some other person and thus sow the seeds of jealousy." (New York Times, July 14, 1931.)

That mirror of human activity, the daily press, illustrates the domestic havoc wrought by our neopagan devotion to superstition. The Chicago Tribune of July 14, 1931, contains the following typical item: "A fortune-teller whose black prophecies have driven Mrs. -, twenty-six-year-old mother of two children, to plunge to her death from a ninth-floor window of the Saranac Hotel yesterday was hunted by the police last night. A note in the dead woman's handwriting evinced fear that her seven-year-old son, Harold, would lose his sight and that her husband would desert her." The same paper, under the date of March 8, 1930, reports: "A young Indian woman's love for a white man, seeking to gain its end by employing ancient Cayuga black magic through the latter-day medium of the ouija-board, brought about the murder of Mrs. — (wife of the white man). The ouija-board warned that, unless the white woman' were killed, she would kill the Indian woman, according to letters found by police."

Every visit to the fortune-teller, every purchase of an amulet, every concession to the spirit of superstition, is an insult to God. His injunction is final: "There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord" (Deut: 18:10, 11). In His omnipotence and loving-kindness He has promised His children that He will direct their affairs for their own better interests, so that all things will work together harmoniously, "for good to them that love God" (Rom. 8:28).

Aside from the fundamental Biblical indictment, fortune-telling is a fraud. The protest of the Scriptures: "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you" (Jer. 29:8), and the flat, unequivocal denunciation of Zechariah (chap. 10:2): "For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain," should serve as a sounding bell for continuous caution.

This warning has been emphasized by successive exposés. A few years ago New York newspapers were asked by a group of seers to publish their weather forecasts rather than the Government bulletins. For a month the New York Times printed both. The most favorable count showed that out of thirty-one chances to be right the clairvoyants made only six correct predictions. Now, if these deceivers cannot do more than make bad guesses about the weather, it needs no elaborate argumentation to show that they have no second sense in family affairs.

Similarly we recall the utter inability of the country's foremost "oracles" to foretell the kidnaping and death which brought sorrow to the Lindbergh home. Joseph Dunninger assembled the annual forecast of 145 prognosticators and could find nothing more than a vague remark in two of the forecasts to the effect that "some-thing will happen early in March which will startle the country." One of the augurs even predicted the Lindbergh child's life would be uneventful until it reached the age of twenty. Nor did a single prophet among the legions of American fortune-tellers point to a Bronx garage as the cache for the ransom-money. If tragedies of nation-wide importance cannot be foretold, by what claim can occultism set itself up as a divine science that can solve domestic difficulties?

The tactics employed by fortune-tellers often amount to black-mail. John Mulholland gives this example of their technique: "One group once worked three years to get its 'evidence.' A select girls' school was singled out. Its students were told 'Aunt Beatrice' would invite them to spend the week-end with her and send a liveried chauffeur to the school for them — all for a very nominal fee. The students took advantage of the opportunity, and several visited 'Aunt Beatrice? Three years later, after they had been introduced to society and married, they paid heavily [in blackmail] for their visit to 'Aunt Beatrice.' A fortune-teller claimed to have read their 'indiscretions' in their palms." (New York Evening World, February 7, 1930.)

A protest must also be voiced against the methods of astrology, which has climbed to incredible heights during the last years: Practically all modern resources of publicity have been drafted into its service. Until the Federal Radio Commission intervened in 1931, regular astrological broadcasts were made over nation-wide chains and by independent stations in our large cities. In one year — so it is claimed — 1,300,000 individuals in the radio audience of the Columbia Broadcasting System requested individual horo-scopes. Magazines print flashy advertisements extolling the powers of astrology; newspapers (Fred C. Kelley in The Commentator asserts that at least 250 newspapers contain regular articles on astrol-ogy) daily feature the signs of the zodiac and their significance; a radio digest headlines: "Astrologer Guarantees Matrimony."

Questions of the heart, of home-life, and family relations are the subjects on which astrological advice is most frequently sought. If a dictograph could be hidden in the lavishly equipped office of a popular astrologer and record the questions answered there, the list of inquiries would repeatedly reveal consultation on these subjects: "Does she love me?" "Is he true to me?" "How can I regain his love?" "Where was he last night?" The late Evangeline Adams, "Queen of American astrologers," admitted: "Most of my callers concern themselves with strictly personal problems. 'Have I met the right man?' 'Am I likely to be engaged this year?' 'Am I to be married soon and, if so, when?' "Will my fate be rich or famous?' 'How can I hold my husband, or how am I to get rid of him?' The largest portion of my daily mail also concerns itself with these questions." In her five-and-ten-cent-store publications, still read with morbid avidity, a front-page appeal invites the reader to learn "how to attract love," "how to make a success of marriage," "how to find your right mate," "how to love." Pseudoscientific recourse is taken to the theories of the ancient Chinese, who allegedly selected their marriage partners without seeing them, according to the dictates of the stars and the influence of the planets in life and love.

The astrological imposition insists that "by the same system of charting the stars which foretell great events can the end or dissolution of marriage be foretold and sometimes avoided." No one should marry without horoscopic investigation, readers are told; for "the planetary aspects, unlike a pretty face or manly chest, do not conceal one's tendencies.... The rogue, the rascal, and the criminal are as easily detected as a regular offender's picture in the rogue's gallery." A client is reminded: "You should never marry. Your Neptune in the seventh house has given you an intense desire for marriage, but it has at the same time prevented you [sic] marrying the kind of man with whom you could be happy." Patent bids for bigger, if not better, astrological business are clothed in insinuations like these: "Your husband's stars, or your wife's, or your sweet-heart's, or your child's, or your partner's, or your friend's may be almost as important to your happiness as your own. You can see from reading these pages how valuable it would be to have the same kind of information about your husband or your wife that you now have about yourself. You can't know too much about a husband; can you?"

How disruptive the advice of astrologists proves in actual life is shown by newspaper items like the following:

"San Jose, California: After twenty-eight years of married life, George D. read an astrology book which revealed the fact that he and his wife were born under adverse planets. He requested his wife to file suit for divorce so that he might find a mate that came under a more congenial planet. She did."

The Christian spurns the very suggestion of astrology. To him it is a pernicious denial of the providential guidance of God. In the Old Testament proud Babylonia is tauntingly challenged to escape her doom by resorting to her astrologers, her star-gazers, and monthly prognosticators (Is. 47:13). While star-worship was practiced generally by all nations surrounding Israel, the Scriptures branded it as a heathen fraud, an abomination, and an insult to God. Today, after the advent of our Savior and the assurance of His divine love, those who take recourse to horoscopes for the pledge of a happy home show a lack of intelligence and a refusal to trust in their heavenly Father. In spite of the frequent Biblical quotations craftily interwoven between the claims of astrologers, the anti-christian character of their doctrine appears in their own statements. Read this and draw your own conclusions: "We are just now emerging from what many people call 'the age of saviors,' lasting two thousand years, during which the human race has been led forward by a succession of great men. We are now coming into the aquarian or humanitarian age, where each man is his own savior." (Evangeline Adams's Own Book of Astrology, p. 14.)

Astrological superstition is, it hardly need be explained, an abject fraud, and a base delusion. The alleged prophecies are clever deductions or mere guesses. The Smithsonian Institution in Washington has published the investigations of eminent scientists who declare that "fortunes in general are not predictable.". Dr. Dirk Brouwer of Yale University declares: "Signs of the zodiac and a scattering of the names of planets and astronomical words still impress people more than the recent new developments in the field of relativity. Astronomers today are practical-minded. They know that for the most part these so-called astrological tables are inaccurate. Even if the tables were correct, there never is, and never has been, any evidence to show that there is a connection between phenomena in the heavens and the lives of men." (New York Times, August 6, 1931.)

The methods employed by astrologers are typical both of the deceit and danger inherent in this soothsaying. An ex-secretary of a celebrated New York astrologer, conveniently called Madame Zamos, brings a devastating exposé of her employer's methods in the Ladies Home Journal of August, 1933. The "madame astrologer" maintained an intelligence corps, employed private detectives (through an attorney's office in order to veil the purpose for which the information was sought) and an office force of twenty-five girls, who were granted a bonus above the wage scale to insure the discretion of sealed lips. With the help of this formidable espionage staff every fragment of incidental gossip, shrewdly ferreted from innocent social contacts, became grist for the astrological mill. For instance, in the foyer of a theater Madame Zamos happened to meet a young woman who had previously consulted her in a love affair and who was now secretary to a prominent metropolitan lawyer. In an imprudent outburst of confidence this young woman pointed to a Mrs. Winston on the other side of the foyer, the daughter of a wealthy New Yorker, and indiscreetly confided to Madame Zamos that Mr. Winston had consulted her employer, the attorney, regarding a divorce in which Mrs. Winston refused to acquiesce because of the desire to preserve her home and avoid newspaper notoriety and social scandal. Next morning Madame's sleuths feverishly set to work in the attempt to discover possible points of contact with wealthy Mrs. Winston. It was soon learned that Mrs. Winston was a dog-fancier, interested particularly in schnauzers. With the craftiness of war-time secret service, Madame directed one of her operators to secure a schnauzer and to exercise it in the same park in which Mrs. Winston took her daily promenade. A meeting of the two schnauzer owners was inevitable, and further rendezvous naturally followed. Gradually snatches of the conversation drifted to the occult; and when soon after Mrs. Winston paid the expected visit to Madame Zamos, she was astounded to hear the tragedy of her married life revealed and her antipathy to divorce and its publicity disclosed. Of course, the "advice" of the well-dressed, perfumed astrological celebrity was divorce. Madame Zamos never hesitated to prescribe divorce when a restless husband or a dissatisfied wife found the marriage bond irksome.

Reviewing her connection with this astrological establishment, the ex-secretary now confesses that the "mystic" madame had no prophetic power, that the only facts she knew were those gleaned by the keyhole tactics of her private snoopers, that newcomers were never given an appointment until three weeks after sufficient data were received in the astrologer's office to make the interview successful. With a very practical appeal to reason, the ex-secretary now believes that, if Madame Zamos knew what would happen tomorrow or next week or next year, she would find more wealth in a stock-broker's office than in her luxurious apartment. But, the ex-secretary concludes, Madame and her ilk know nothing more of the future than we know ourselves.

The parade of superstition marches on in long columns and with arrogant pomp. Here is a warning voiced by a palmist, one of the large guild which has revived the claim that marital destiny is etched in the lines of the hands: "A young man or girl should never contemplate matrimony without a real study and understanding of each other's hands. It isn't necessary that they be alike or even similar, but it is most imperative that they dovetail. There must not be warfare between their head lines and their heart lines, those two important long lines that run crossways across the middle of the hand."

Those who permit such claims to convince them that "there must be something in palmistry" should take I.Q. tests to learn their real mental age. Anatomists have proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the lines of the hand are of purely physical origin, entirely destitute of any psychic or predictive association. There would at least be the asset of originality if some wide-awake mystic would introduce pedoscopy, the reading of the sole of the foot. Few besides the Chinese seem to have hit upon this mode of prophecy, and foot-reading is at least relatively modern, while palmistry has been tried and rejected even in the dim and distant centuries.

As the advice of all soothsayers, the counsel which even the reputedly best palmists offer is often evil. Beckwith Kirk, internationally known as "one of the world's most famous palmists," inadvertently confesses the way in which this fraud may banish all home happiness. In an interview in Collier's he confides: "Recently a woman who is socially prominent came to me. She had already taken steps toward divorcing her husband, but she said she was still madly in love with him and was uncertain as to whether she had acted wisely. I looked at her hands. The sign of divorce appeared in both of them. It was inevitable.

"Anything which is shown by signs in both hands cannot be averted. In the left hand an idea or suggestion arises. In the right hand it is carried out.

""You will have to go through with it,' I said. "You will have to learn your lesson, to steel yourself to sorrow. It is going to be hard for you indeed, and you will never quite suppress your love for your husband; but it is the only way?"

While the Church fights its battle to uphold the sanctity of marriage and insists upon its lifelong and indissoluble nature, these professional liars are being paid exorbitant prices for killing love and promoting divorce.

The fraud of palmistry is evident. Kirk, who did not hesitate to help alienate a wife's affections from her husband, is so shocked by the extortions of some fellow-palmists that he is driven to protest: "Now, the fact that a palmist is a professional doesn't mean that it is safe to consult him. You cannot be too careful in choosing a reputable palmist. The story in your hand is an open book to the palmist, and sometimes unscrupulous ones 'cash in' on the knowledge so revealed to them. We had a case in England not long ago where a married woman of some social standing consulted a palmist who read in her palms the story of a youthful indiscretion. At first she denied it, but subsequently confessed. For years he extorted money from her by threatening to reveal the facts to her husband; but finally, when she became desperate and could pay no more, the woman told her husband, and the blackmailer was brought to justice."

These near-tragedies might be laughed off if it were not for the ugly influences on home-life that all merchants of mystery, numerologists, as well as tea-leaf readers, crystal-ball gazers, dream-interpreters, telepathy amateurs, graphologists, and other members of this unsavory guild have exerted. Their efforts have planted false obsessions in the hearts of unnumbered credulous dupes and wrecked thousands of happy homes.

In the nineteenth chapter of Acts we read that a mighty conversion followed the convincing demonstration of the Gospel's power in Ephesus. The fruits of the new faith showed themselves when "many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men; and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver," the largest detailed sum mentioned in New Testament history.

We can find a vital lesson for modern Christian society in this incident. Trust in God, which the Gospel of Jesus Christ has given us, definitely rules out every compromise with any form of superstition. Once our hearts have been given to Christ, who has pledged: "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee" (Heb. 13:5), once our lives have been put under His leadership, all recourse to idolatry is ruled out. Even a semitolerant attitude of amused interest in superstitious practices has been known to produce shocking complications. The warning of the Church is inflexible and uncompromising: Shun every approach to these pseudo-occult frauds!

Let us light a fire to consume all the magazines and books on fortune-telling, all the popularized games and devices of forecast-ing, all the dream books, the "Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses," the amulets and charms, the rabbits' feet, the good-luck rings, and the other symbols of superstition which may have found their way into many homes with or without parental knowledge. Let husbands or wives take the two or three hours required by a consultation with these fraudulent doctors of domestic ills and spend that time in fervent prayer! Let us take the money, offered half jestingly to Gipsy palmists, Hindu crystal-gazers, "professors" of astrology, in carnivals, county fairs, and resorts of commercialized recreation and use these funds for the support of any well-conceived measures that would place these impostors where they should be — either in our penal institutions or preferably beyond the bounds of the country.

#### EDUCATIONAL COUNSEL

During recent years, a growing number of educators has held that one of the most beneficial and stabilizing influences in the solution particularly of sex problems must be the candid counsel of educational guidance. In communities like Bronxville and Scarsdale, New York, sex education is taught in the primary schools.

In evaluating these experiments, it may be said, first of all, that the Church is not opposed to enlightenment on these personal questions. If an understanding of general physiology is desirable for bodily well-being, then it is equally evident that intelligence and class discussion should help banish misunderstanding regarding God's gift of human love and its functions. Wilful blindness and utter ignorance never serve any good purpose. With the lips of many parents sealed on these vital matters, young people frequently glean their information on sex from perverted sources, so that their first attitudes are misshapen.

Maryland young people gave the following answers, among others, in Youth Tell Their Story (p. 42) to questions regarding the source of their "sex education":

"I got it out in the street."

"Just from different talk around. My mother never would tell me anything."

"I've had a car since I was sixteen, so you know what that is."

"From the gang I hang around with."

"In the gutter, where everybody else gets theirs."

"I learned by experience."

"On the street corner."

"I got an earful here and an earful there."

"My mother is one of those old-timers who believe in letting you find things out for yourself."

"When I was thirteen, mother told me everything about it."

On the other hand, however, the wave of enthusiasm for the dissemination of the facts of life among our grammar-school children and the zeal with which this is promoted entail highly objectionable features. The grammar-school is clearly not the proper place for this material, for it is far beyond the years of most children, and its recital in the classroom will often awaken latent curiosity and provoke morbid inquiry. The ensuing familiarity may, more than anything else, lead to a contempt of the truth and stimulate blasé discussion.

Besides, education in itself is never a panacea. The late Dr. R. C. Cabot, professor of medicine and social ethics at Harvard University, declares: "It isn't knowledge that keeps people 'straight'; if it did, doctors and nurses would be the most exemplary people in the world, — and we know they are not. The teaching of sex hygiene in the public schools is not helpful to the youth of the land, in my estimation. In the first place, it centralizes the attention and the thought and the imagination on a thing that we do not want the thought centralized upon; hence its teaching is contradictory. Children develop along sex lines at widely divergent ages. What one child is ready for in the way of instruction the next one is not ready for, and to force knowledge upon a child who is not ready for it is a serious thing. Such knowledge should be imparted to individuals and not to groups."

More than information is required. Floyd Allport, psychologist, admits: "One important caution must be borne in mind. The mere informing of the child in sexual matters, if not combined with the formation of attitudes, principles, and habits proper to persons possessing such knowledge, is as likely to produce harmful as it is beneficial results. The mere desire to tell the child the truth' is in itself no adequate justification for imparting the physiological facts. The aim should be not merely sex enlighten-ment, but sex training." (Quoted in Marriage, by Bakewell Morrison, S. J.)

Speaking to Boston University students, Karl de Schweinitz, Pennsylvania School of Social Work, recently conceded: "Our grandparents acted on the theory that the less said about sex, the better. We seem to be guided by the principle that it cannot be talked about too much. There is at the outset the belief that information is itself a solution." He insisted that vastly more effective than knowledge is "the observation by the child of a satisfactory home-life; the love and affection of the parents for each other and for their children and the feeling of security this gives to the children. Those emotional elements in family life are more vital than facts and have an infinitely greater influence upon the lives of children."

With this pronounced increase in the study of physiology and the understanding of the body we could expect that juvenile delinquency would be drastically checked. The absolute antithesis confronting us shows that education alone can never meet the high hopes placed in its illuminative power. It must be supplemented by something else.

That something else is the fear of God. Unless young people realize in a very personal way that sex in itself is a holy bestowal of our heavenly Father and that sin has ineffaceably marred the attitude of the entire human race towards its beauties, its privileges, and its blessings, they cannot understand that the prime requirements for moral strengthening are the forgiveness and the removal of sin and the checking of animal desires. Jesus says: "Without Me ye can do nothing," and the sex education which eliminates Christ and His Scriptures may often produce nothing more than a mental assimilation of physiological data. It is only with God's Word as a divine spectrum that the various colorings of these questions can be carefully distinguished and properly evaluated. Because modern instruction has little appreciation for the soul-molding influence of Christianity, sex education, as commonly understood, has sometimes defeated the ends for which it is instituted.

By what process, then, is this vital information to be imparted? With the assurance that the average boy or girl at adolescence has a vague and usually incorrect understanding of some major facts, Christian parents must give their own children an accurate outline of the basic truths. It is entirely unnecessary to indulge in intricacies and much detail or resort to diagrams and illustrations. Life itself will teach many of these lessons. When children who are approaching adolescence begin to ask, as they inevitably do, repeated questions as to the origin of life, they should not be side-tracked with hush or evasion and least of all with mythological absurdities that no child of that age believes.

At the same time children must be warned directly against the attraction of sin and the abuses of God's gifts. They should be told that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and they should be reminded of the commandment of purity. How modern parents can complacently see their children thrown into a world of topsy-turvy morals — without a home basis for guidance — is one of the too frequent mysteries even in church circles. Parental direction is part of the moral duty which all fathers and mothers share; but it is a spiritual obligation of Christians that parents who bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord extend the instruction to include the reverent guidance in those questions where ignorance or perversion often gives soul-destroying answers. Let fathers counsel their sons, mothers their daughters, and know that the advice thus given may be of far-reaching consequence.

If parents are incapable of imparting this information or unwilling to do so, the services of a Christian physician may be employed. His objective presentation will certainly act as a corrective to false ideas or harmful exaggerations, particularly when appropriate emphasis is laid upon the sins of impurity and their punishment as well as upon the helpful spiritual forces. Recourse may also be taken to some of the few and good books which have been issued by Christian writers. Omitting technical books, we recommend to our readers volumes like the Ought to Know books, reverently conceived and carefully written by Sylvanus Stall, D. D. This series embraces four volumes for men and as many for women, each emphasizing the purity problems of the four ages: boyhood, young manhood, early marriage, and late marriage. Particularly helpful because of its brevity and practical presentation is Why was I Not Told? by E. W. Marquardt, M. D., a Christian physician of wide experience. The publishers of the present volume will be glad to answer inquiries concerning this and other books.

In postmarital difficulties, family troubles, and domestic misunderstandings the good offices of the pastor will be the most helpful agency for reestablishing mutual understanding. Young couples who regard their pastor as old-fashioned, ultra-conservative, and austere often refuse to give him the opportunity of showing the warmth of human sympathy and the understanding friendliness which are his. To those who declare that they simply cannot discuss their home affairs with their spiritual advisers let it be said that perhaps the fault is theirs. It may be that behind this reluctance is a disquieted conscience, agitated by the acute realization that their pastor may feel constrained to raise his voice in warning. Perhaps there is a wholly unwarranted fear that the busy minister is altogether too preoccupied to listen to their individual problems. Or perhaps this reticence is due to an unfortunate feeling of distance, aggravated in some large congregations by the fact that to all intents and purposes the pastor and some of his young people are almost strangers.

Whatever may account for this cleft, every newly founded Christian home should gratefully accept the spiritual guidance of the pastor and gladly consult him in any difficulty requiring his counsel. This impartial guidance will help to lead many through the maze of modern complexities, while wilful spurning of these friendly offices and reliance on crafty and commercial counselors may lead to the quicksands.

Some pastors are particularly zealous in maintaining their connections with those whom they have started in married life. A clergyman who writes at least one letter every year to every couple he has married conducts a reunion service to which the brides and bridegrooms he has united are especially invited. On this occasion the sermon deals with the Christian home, and a copy is mailed to those couples who are unable to attend. He seems unusually successful in serving as a counselor to these families; for his report summarizes: "I have married in the course of the last fourteen years 722 couples. Half of these had only the most superficial contact with me before the wedding. The average divorce rate would have given my group a total of 123 broken homes. Up to date fewer than a dozen of these homes have been shattered by dissensions, and fewer than half a dozen of them have been ruined by divorce. And the experience has been one of the most rewarding things in my life." (Bernard C. Clausen, "An Adventure in Defeating Divorce," Journal of Social Hygiene, March, 1934.)

### AT THE FAMILY ALTAR

As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord - Josh. 24:15

Almost every one of the seven million high-school students in our country is familiar with Robert Burns's The Cotter's Saturday Night. In homely lines the poet takes us to the cottage of a Scotch patriarch when the children return to the paternal roof after a week of toil. The climax is reached in this depiction of the devotional hour:

The cheefu' supper done, wi' serious face
They round the ingle form a circle wide;
The sire turns o'er with patriarchal grace
The big ha'-Bible, ance his father's pride;
His bonnet rev'rently is laid aside,
His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare;
Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide
He wales a portion with judicious care,
And "Let us worship God" he says with solemn air.

They chant their artless notes in simple guise;
They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim.
Perhaps Dundee's wild warbling measures rise
Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name;
Or noble Elgin beets the heavenward flame,
The sweetest fear of Scotia's holy lays.
Compared with these, Italian trills are tame:
The tickl'd ears no heartfelt raptures raise;
Nae unison hae they with our Creator's praise.

The priestlike father reads the sacred page,
How Abram was the friend of God on high
Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage
With Amalek's ungracious progeny,
Or how the royal bard did groaning lie
Beneath the stroke of Heaven's avenging ire,
Or Job's pathetic plaint and wailing cry,
Or rapt Isaiah's wild seraphic fire,
Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre.

Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme:
How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed;
How He who bore in heaven the second name
Had not on earth whereon to lay His head;
How His first followers and servants sped,
The precepts sage they wrote to many a land;
How he who lone in Patmos banished
Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand
And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounced by
Heaven's command.

Then, kneeling down to heaven's eternal King,
The saint, the father, and the husband
Hope springs exulting on triumphant wing
That thus they all shall meet in future days,
There ever bask in uncreated rays,
No more to sigh or shed the bitter tear,
Together hymning their Creator's praise
In such society, yet still more dear,
While circling time moves round in an eternal sphere.

#### BREAKING WITH THE PAST

Unfortunately the reality of this family worship is as far removed from our America of today as its Scotch dialect from our present parlance. When Calvin Coolidge, "sworn in" by his father after the death of President Harding, took his oath of office on the Coolidge family Bible, that act brought to memory the family Scriptures in the American home of the past generations. We recalled the pages between the Testaments perpetuating the family record of births, marriages, and deaths, painstakingly inscribed by gnarled fingers; we were reminded of the decorous figures of America's yesterday, that spoke in measured syllables of Jacobean English, of the long list of eminent Americans who were given Bible names, and of the importance which the family Bible assumed in those halcyon days as the very center of the American Christian home.

In our apartment era, the family altar has often become an antiquarian curiosity. Henry C. Cope, General Secretary of the Religious Education Association, laments in his study Religious Education in the Family (p. 126): "Family worship has declined until, at least in the United States, the percentage of families practicing daily worship in the home is so small as to be negligible."

A few years ago a census of the number of homes participating in family worship was taken through a questionnaire sent to members in some 150 typical congregations of the Lutheran Church, a body which is commonly regarded as retaining more pronounced interest in family prayers. Figures were secured from a cross-section of the congregations in various parts of the country: from American churches and foreign-language groups, from old established churches as well as from mission-chapels and preaching-stations. The first question asked was: "Do you have family devotion in your home?" Of the thousands who submitted information, 60 per cent admitted that the Bible was not read regularly in the family circle and family prayers were never spoken in their home environment. Other evidence shows that this is a very high average. For instance, in a prayer investigation conducted by a church federation on Long Island a large portion of those interrogated admitted that they prayed altogether "once or less a day."

While some regard this neglect of the family altar as an encouraging sign of enlightenment, calm thinkers will agree with the statement of the Wall Street Journal, which as early as 1921 declared: "What America needs ... is a revival of piety, the kind Mother and Father used to have, piety that counted it good business to stop for family prayers before breakfast right in the middle of the harvest, that quit work a half hour earlier Thursday night so as to get the chores done and go to prayer-meeting. That is what we need to rid this country of graft and of greed, petty and big, of worship of fine houses and big lands and high office and grand social functions."

#### RADIATED BLESSINGS

The blessings radiated by the family altar may be tested in the laboratory of life as it is lived today. The words of the Rev. F. C. Michelfelder, superintendent of the Lutheran. Inner Mission Society of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, are meaningful: "In five years of Inner Mission experience we have asked hundreds of men and women who professed Christianity but became dependent or delinquent, and only by way of exception have we found that they had been accustomed to a family altar where there is regular reading of God's Word and devotions."

The force of home worship in its molding influence can hardly be exaggerated. Dr. Charles M. Sheldon, well-known religious writer, emphasized this blessing in an article published in the Christian Century some time ago. He recalled: "The first impression of a contented ideal in life and an idea that fitted it to make it practical, that I can remember, centers about the habit of family worship, which was established by my father and mother on their wedding-day. The regular reading of the Bible, the singing of a simple hymn, the kneeling down in the family circle while Father offered the morning prayer, praying for us often by name, the quiet moment of meditation that followed before we went out of that little log house on the Dakota prairie to begin the day's work on the ranch, produced lasting results in my thinking and profoundly influenced my conduct. ... In numberless cases of temptation, I recall, it was the memory of our family circle at prayer time, with Father asking for God's blessing on 'Charley' and 'Alice' and 'Ward' and 'Agnes,' that kept me from the shame of an unclean experience and helped me to escape the tormenting memories that several of my school and university classmates have confessed to me are a part of their heritage. Anything that had in it the power to influence a boy's physical passions and direct for an entire lifetime his daily ambitions and ideals must have some astonishing and unquestionable value. The religious atmosphere we breathed every day while we were children was the birthplace and the nourishment of whatever ideals in life I have ever had."

John G. Paton, heroic missionary to the cannibals of the South Sea Islands, recounts the blessing he received through the family prayer in the thatched cottage which he called home. In his life's story (John G. Paton, D.D., An Autobiography, p. 21) we read: "How much my father's prayers... impressed me I can never ex-plain, nor could any stranger understand. When, on his knees, and all of us kneeling round him in family worship, he poured out his whole soul with tears for the conversion of the heathen world to the service of Jesus and for every personal and domestic need, we, all of us, felt as if we were in the presence of the living Savior, and I learned to know and love Him as our divine Friend. As we rose from our knees, I used to look at the light on my father's face and wish I were like him in spirit, hoping that in answer to his prayers I might be privileged and prepared to carry the blessed Gospel to some portion of the heathen world."

Those petitions were answered, as were many others in behalf of the evangelization of the world. We may say that the first chapters in the history of many missions have been written at the family altar. Back of Bartholomew Ziegenbalg, first Protestant missionary to India's millions, was the pleading of his mother, who on her death-bed, maintaining her habitual prayer with her son, placed the Bible into his hands. The petitions of Christian parents in behalf of Christian Frederick Schwartz, a subsequent ambassador to India, recalled him from the highway of dissolute sin. It was the prayerful Christian home that made another remarkable contribution to the cause of the Christian ministry. In South Africa Andrew Murray reared a family of eleven children. Five of the six sons became ministers, and of the five daughters, four were married to ministers. Of the next generation, twenty-three of Andrew Murray's grandsons became ministers of congregations or missionaries in foreign fields. The family intercession of Dr. and Mrs. John Scudder arose in India, beseeching the Almighty that their sons and daughters might be "not Christians only, dear Lord, but missionaries, every one, if it be Thy will." With the exception of one son, who died while in college, all their children returned to the foreign mission field. Indeed, this unusual family in three generations has produced approximately forty missionaries. When Dr. Scudder was asked to explain this remarkable missionary zeal, he replied: "The only explanation I can give is that the children were literally prayed into the Kingdom by their mother. She was accustomed to spend the birthday of each child in all-day prayer for him. And God answered her prayers."

Of the blessings which may follow family worship, Paton cites the following instance: "Blessed to others as well as to ourselves was the light of such an example. I have heard that in long after-years the worst woman in Thorthorwald, then leading an immoral life, but since changed by the grace of God, was known to declare that the only thing that kept her from despair and from the hell of suicide was when in the dark winter nights she crept close up underneath my father's window and heard him pleading in family worship that God would convert the sinner from the error of wicked ways and polish him as a jewel for the Redeemer's crown.' 'I felt,' said she, 'that I was a burden on that good man's heart, and I knew that God would not disappoint him. That thought kept me out of hell and at last led me to the only Savior.'" (L. c., pp. 14, 15.)

The best-known commentary written in the English language is Matthew Henry's. That explanation of the Old and New Testaments originated at the family altar. Of Matthew Henry's father, Philip Henry, we are told: "He and his wife constantly prayed together morning and evening. He made a conscience of family worship and abounded in it. He said to his children and friends: 'Be sure to look to your sacred duty; keep that up for whatever you do; one cannot prosper in the neglect of it. Apostasy generally begins at the closet door.'" As the father read and explained the Scriptures day after day, his son Matthew and others in the family-altar circle recorded his interpretations, and these notes formed the basis of the commentary which has been more widely distributed than any other English exposition of the Scriptures.

Entirely apart from such spiritual blessings is a certain cultural by-product, to which Ruskin alludes as he pays this tribute to his mother's insistence upon the reading of the Scriptures: "My mother forced me by steady toil to learn long chapters of the Bible by heart as well as to read it every syllable through, aloud, hard names and all, from Genesis to Revelation, about once a year; and to that discipline, patient, accurate, and resolute, I owe not only a knowledge of the Book, but much of my general power of taking pains and the best part of my taste in literature. After our chapters (from two to three a day, according to their length, the first thing after breakfast, and no interruption from servants allowed, none from visitors, who either joined in the reading or had to stay up-stairs, and none from any visitings or excursions except real traveling) I had to learn a few verses by heart or repeat, to make sure I had not lost something of what was already known."

How the family altar helps in building the Church is remarkably illustrated by two impressive examples. About two hundred years ago Thomas Boston, a Scotch preacher, was called to a congregation in the slums, which apparently had little hope of continuance and blessing. The services were poorly attended, and his ministry seemed in vain. After all else seemed to fail, Boston resolved to bring Christ into the homes of his parishioners; for he felt that then he could bring his parishioners home to Christ. For thirty years, night after night, he went into the crowded rooms of his people, and there, in the family circles of the poor, he taught his members how to pray and how to read the Scriptures. In consequence his church revived and flourished with unprecedented growth. In this policy he followed the example of Richard Baxter, about a hundred years before his time, who also was called to a difficult charge in Kidderminster, a congregation made up of impoverished weavers. Baxter was twenty-six years old when he took over the work with a small group of members who had remained loyal. With undaunted spirit he went straight into the homes of Kidderminster and showed the carpet-weavers how to establish family worship. He was forty-five years old when he left, but in these nineteen years during which he ceaselessly stressed the importance of family prayers, Kidderminster was transformed. It was said that, when Baxter began his work, he found entire streets with only a home or two in which family prayers were spoken. When he was called away, on the same streets only a family or two could be found that did not worship Christ daily. As both Boston and Baxter built the church by building its homes, so the clergy today will do well to lay this family base.

When the statue of Rufus Choate, one of the ablest of American statesmen and lawyers, was unveiled in Boston, the eloquent tribute which Joseph Choate, his distinguished nephew, paid to his memory, contained this testimony to the stimulus of family Bible-reading: "He [Rufus Choate] came of a long line of pious and devout ancestors, whose living was as plain as their thinking was high. It was from father and mother that he derived the flame of intellect, the glow of spirit, and the beauty of temperament that were so unique. And his nurture to manhood was worthy of the child. It was 'the nurture and admonition of the Lord. From that rough pine cradle, which is still preserved in the room where he was born, to his premature grave, at the age of fifty-nine, it was one long course of training and discipline of mind and character without pause or rest. It began with that well-thumbed and dog's eared Bible from Hog Island, its leaves actually worn away by the pious hands that had turned them, read daily in the family from January to December, in at Genesis and out at Revelation every two years. And upon this solid rock of the Scriptures he built a magnificent structure of knowledge and acquirement, to which few men in America have ever attained."

To those who waver in uncertainty as to the benefits of the family altar I direct this dozen of reasons for instituting home devotions:

1.  The family altar will enrich, elevate, and ennoble our homes, the relations between husband and wife, parents and children, as nothing else can.
2.  Family prayers will minimize domestic misunderstanding and when trouble arises will work quickly for peace and forbearance.
3.  The family altar, pointing to the complete self-denial and self-sacrifice of Christ, will help to stifle selfishness in us and promote forbearance, generosity, courtesy.
4.  Home worship will prove invaluable in emphasizing the Christian way of life and the verities of the Christian faith to the children in each family.
5.  Prayers in the morning will guide us through the day, and their blessings will strengthen us at work, in school, or at play.
6.  Prayers in the evening will invoke the angels' watchfulness over us and ours, affording light in the darkness and protection in our weakness.
7.  The family altar will strengthen us to withstand bravely the adversities of life, for it helps to found our homes on that Rock against which all trials and tempests will beat in vain.
8.  Family prayers will exert a blessed influence on friends who visit our homes or on guests who are sheltered within our walls.
9.  Prayerful homes will help to reenforce that righteousness which "exalteth a nation."
10. The family altar will mightily strengthen the work and the influence of the Church and its agencies throughout the world.
11. Prayerful homes will honor our heavenly Father and, in turn, be honored by Him.
12. Families that are fervent in the faith have a foretaste of the heavenly homeland even on earth and enjoy the assurance that in the prepared mansions they will be a part of "the whole family in heaven."

#### THE SUPREME TRAGEDY

With the family altar radiating such blessing, it is one of the supreme tragedies of our modern home-life that its sustaining power is neglected. Christians today often show less interest in these devotions than the persecuted believers did in the days when Bible-reading was punished as heretical. In his autobiography Benjamin Franklin writes: "Our family was Protestant throughout the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal. They had an English Bible; and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened, open, with tapes under and within the cover of a joint stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its teet, where the Bible remained concealed under it as before." Today, when this risk has been eliminated, the apparitor would often walk in vain.

The questionnaire to which reference was made before, also asked: "If you do not have family devotion, please state here why not." The prevalent answer to this was, in effect: "We have no time when all can gather for this purpose." In the rush which dominates many of our homes the time element is a very vital factor. In the morning the daily scramble preceding the hurried exit from the home hardly leaves room for organized family worship. And when the last member of the household has returned in the evening, some of the others are already busy with their preparations for night's duties and pleasures.

Under these handicaps it is first of all necessary to make place for family worship. Since the reading of a portion of Scripture, the prayer, and then perhaps the singing of a few stanzas from a favorite hymn requires six or eight minutes at the most, few homes, however busy and complicated they are, will not be able to set aside this time. If no other way suggests itself, the members of the household can at least rise ten minutes earlier each morning. And at night the most appropriate occasion will doubtless present itself immediately after the evening meal. If we appreciate how incessant our gratitude to God should be, we shall be ready to accept any small inconveniences that may be involved. Luther, for whom each day was a strenuous struggle with all but overpowering responsibilities, who once paused to give us a picture of his home, its tables and benches, closets and window seats, piled high with correspondence and petitions and printer's proofs, and who had to dictate letters during his meals, was not so preoccupied that he could not worship with his own at the family altar. He writes: "Let him who can read take up each morning a psalm or other chapter in the Scriptures and study it for a time. This I do: when I rise with the children, I pray the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer, and some psalm besides." When he was hindered from attending church, he would preach to the children and the servants. These home sermons, which were later published, are now known as the House Postil and are replete with helpful suggestions for the strengthening of the home ties even today.

A grandson of Mrs. Washington, George Washington Parke Custis, says that it was the first President's custom at Mount Vernon to "read a sermon or some portion of the Bible to Mrs. Washington in the afternoon," after the regular church attendance on Sunday morning. He also states that, while President Washington was in Philadelphia, "in the evening the President read to Mrs. Washington in her chamber a sermon or some portion of the Sacred Writing." (Custis, Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington, p. 173.)

In the midst of his literary activities on Samoa, Robert L. Stevenson, long harassed by great fragility of health, not only took time to maintain family prayers, but also to summon the household and the neighborhood for daily worship. At the introduction to a volume of prayers written by this notable author, his widow writes: "With my husband, prayer, the direct appeal, was a necessity. When he was happy, he felt impelled to give thanks for that undeserved joy; when in sorrow or pain, to call for strength to bear what must be borne.

"Vailima lay up some three miles of continual rise from Apia and more than half that distance from the nearest village. It was a long way for a tired man to walk down every evening with the sole purpose of joining in family worship; and the road through the bush was dark and to the Samoan imagination beset with supernatural terrors. Wherefore, as soon as our household had fallen into a regular routine and the bonds of Samoan family life began to draw us closer together, Tusitala [the Samoan name of Steven-son, meaning 'story-teller'] felt the necessity of including our retainers in our evening devotions. I suppose ours was the only white man's family in all Samoa, except those of the missionaries, where the day naturally ended with this homely, patriarchal custom. The service began by my son's reading a chapter from the Samoan Bible. Tusitala followed with a prayer in English. Then came the singing of one or more hymns in the native tongue. Sometimes a passing band of hostile warriors, with blackened faces, would peer in at us through the open windows, and often we were forced to pause until the strangely savage, monotonous noise of the native drums had ceased; but no Samoan changed his reverent attitude."

Speaking in the House of Lords soon after the death of Lord Roberts, Lord Curzon read this excerpt from the last letter which the Field Marshal of Great Britain had written him: "We have had family prayers for fifty-five years. Our chief reason, besides worship, is that they bring the household together in a way that nothing else can." Even with heavy military routine and despite multiple interruptions, Lord Roberts was able to maintain these meditations day after day for more than half a century.

Mrs. Elias Compton, American Mother for 1939, told the National Broadcasting Company's Red Network audience: "People often say to me that they cannot find time in the morning for family prayers. We solved that problem by rising a few minutes earlier to begin the day rightly with thanksgiving. Only illness or an exceptional reason kept the family from assembling at prayers or meals.

In those moments when we knelt together, praying with and for each other, — for friends, for our country and for the world, - something was unconsciously fused into our very being which has been a lasting influence upon each of us. These moments created a bond of fellowship and a feeling of interdependence which exists today, even though thousands of miles may separate us."

It is the earnest appeal of the Church that, especially in newly established homes, the Christian husband and wife, pledged together "for better or for worse," will find time for Christ — full, reverent, appreciative time, even when home cares or social issues seem to crowd the daily calendar beyond its capacity — and assure themselves of the perpetual blessings and companionship of Him who must be the Third in every essentially happy union.

There should be time, too, for the few seconds required to invoke the benediction of God upon our food. It often takes a catastrophe to break down our mechanistic philosophy and to make us realize that "the eyes of all wait upon Thee, and Thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest Thine hand and satisfiest the desire of every living thing" (Ps. 145:15, 16). After Robinson Crusoe recovered from the illness that had brought him close to death's door, he wrote in his June 28 entry: "I walked about but was very weak and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper the next day. At night I made my supper of three of the turtles' eggs, which I roasted in the ashes and ate in the shell; and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, even as I could remember, in my whole life." If we would enumerate the constructive aspects of our retarded prosperity as our nation has experienced it, one of the most outstanding contributions which depressions have wrought would be the realization in some otherwise indifferent hearts that the three meals on the American daily table are not accidental or inevitable but the undeserved bestowal of God, who can give or withhold. With the conviction of this truth, grace at meals becomes a holy privilege.

King Alfonso V of Aragon is known to posterity as "the Magnanimous." Of consecrated Christian faith, he deplored the ingratitude of his courtiers in omitting grace at meals. They argued, as many people do today: "Why should we pray for what we already have? And why should we thank God for it when it is the king who supplies our food?" In order to teach those hard-grained materialists a lesson, he invited them to a special banquet, at which he, too, omitted the table prayer. During the courses a ragged, disheveled tramp strode into the palace dining-hall, seated himself at the royal table, and without a word of apology or explanation started to devour vast quantities of the king's food. A dozen of the courtiers rose to throw the wretch out; but the king intervened and told his knights: "You are very angry with this poor fellow because of his discourteous and ungrateful behavior. Yet he has done only what you do three times a day. In God's sight you must appear less worthy to Him than the beggar appears to me. When you go to your table every day, you never give a word of recognition to the King, the Father in heaven; and when you are satisfied, you go your way without a word of thanks for the Giver of all good. Do you suppose that God is less angry with you who are so unthankful than you are with the ungrateful tramp?"

#### NO APOLOGIES FOR FAMILY PRAYERS!

Neither should we apologize for family prayer. When visitors are welcomed into the family circle, it is a contradiction of our Christian profession to omit the family worship. Henry Clay was once forced to stay overnight at a log cabin in his native Kentucky. Although the father had habitually exercised his paternal priesthood both morning and evening, the presence of the distinguished orator disturbed him. At last, when the sleepy children were becoming restless and Clay had refused an invitation to retire, the Kentuckian, urged on by his wife's pointed gestures, acknowledged that it was his custom to conduct family prayer and that Clay could either join or go to his quarters. The great statesman replied that he would prefer to participate, unless this was regarded as intrusive. After the father had finished with much embarrassment the Scripture-reading and prayer, Clay sympathetically told him: "My dear sir, never again feel the least hesitation in the discharge of your duty to God on account of the presence of man. I saw your embarrassment and remained on purpose that you might never feel it again. Remember that every man of sense will respect the individual who is not ashamed to acknowledge his dependence upon his Maker; and he deserves only contempt who can cherish any other feelings than reverence for 'the consecrated hour of man in audience with the Deity? I would rather know that the prayers of a pious man, no matter how humble his position in life, were ascending in my behalf than to have the wildest applause of listening Senators."

The faithful Boswell records a similar instance in which a solicitous host was disquieted by Dr. Johnson's presence at the time of family prayer. Boswell's condemnation of this overdelicate hesitancy is classic. He writes: "I said that the Doctor might sit in the library while we were at family worship. Mr. M'Aulay said he would omit it rather than give Dr. Johnson offense; but I would by no means agree that an excess of politeness, even to so great a man, should prevent what I esteem as one of the best pious regu-lations. I know nothing more beneficial, more comfortable, more agreeable, than that the little societies of each family should regularly assemble and unite in praise and prayer to our heavenly Father, from whom we daily receive so much good and may hope for more in a higher state of existence."

Many young people hesitate to establish their family altar because they regard practically all religious exercises as beyond their scope and ability. They share the feeling of inferiority expressed in the following confession recorded in The Real Home: "Ten years ago I boarded in the family of a pious woman whose husband was not religious. There was a daughter nineteen years of age, another of fourteen, and a son of ten. Every morning I heard that humble woman gather her family in the kitchen and read a chapter, verse by verse, in the Bible. Then, as I could not help listening, there was a peculiarity of service that mystified me.

"At last, one day, I asked if I might remain. She hesitated; her daughter blushed; but she said I could do so if I really desired it. So I sat down with the rest. They gave me a Testament, and we read a verse in turn. Then, kneeling on the floor, that mother began her prayer audibly, for her dear ones there, for her husband, and herself, and then, pausing a moment, as if to gather energy or wing her faith, uttered a tender, affectionate supplication for me.

"She closed, and her daughter began to pray. Poor girl, she was afraid of me. I was from college; I was her teacher; but she tremulously asked a blessing as usual. Then came the other daughter and at last the son, the youngest of that circle, who only repeated the Lord's Prayer, with one petition of his own.

"His 'Amen' was said, but no one arose. I knew on that instant they were waiting for me. And I, poor, prayerless I, had no word to say. It almost broke my heart. I hurried from the room, desolate and guilty.

"A few weeks only had passed when I asked their permission to come in once more; and then I prayed, too, and thanked my dear, patient Savior for the hope in my heart and the new song on my lips."

We shall do well to attain the ease and intimacy of prayer which marked the faith of Stephen Foster's mother. Her constant communion with God is described by another son in this glowing tribute: "No unkind word ever passed between any members of that family; for strife was repelled and anger washed away by the pure stream of love that emanated from her presence. Her discourses abounded in illustrations of the goodness of God and the necessity for recognizing the fact that dependence on Him alone constitutes the happiness of mankind. Sometimes she would say, almost abruptly, 'And now, my children, kneel down here and let us pray to our heavenly Father. Rising, her face resumed its sweet, sunny aspect, and everything went on as though it were the most natural thing in the world to fall down and worship God at any time." (Raymond Walters, Stephen Foster, Youth's Golden Gleam, pp. 111, 112.)

#### A PROGRAM FOR HEARTHSIDE DEVOTIONS

No exceptional ability, no technical preparation, is required to express the sincerity of home prayer. For the benefit particularly of young people who are looking at marriage from the background of a home that never fully appreciated the blessings of the family altar, the following practical suggestions are offered:

1.  Let each devotion embrace at least the reading of a portion of Scripture, a prayer by one of the members of the household, and a prayer in unison. If time and circumstances permit, a few verses should be sung from the hymnal.
2.  Scriptural reading should be taken from the Bible, while the devotional exercises and the prayers may be read from any of many good devotional books. Usually it will be found that the books with devotional material for every day in the year are more valuable than those containing only prayers for the seven days of the week. Basic in all prayers should be the petition for the forgiveness of sin and the gratitude for Christ's redeeming grace. The spontaneous prayer from the heart of the father or the mother, mentioning the special and individual needs of the household and emphasizing the requests that crowd themselves into the family life, are of , course particularly beneficial, but for some the most difficult of all prayers. — Why is it that we are so often hesitant about discussing with our nearest relatives and kin those needs which are of such indescribable importance for the welfare of our soul?
3.  The devotional exercise should meet the understanding and the requirements of the younger members of the household.

Let no young husband or wife insist that, because family prayer has been neglected during their entire previous life, it is too late to introduce it after marriage. It is a definite requirement of the Scriptures that we "learn first to show piety at home" (1 Tim. 5:4). And in what way can piety be shown more directly and forcefully than in the sincere outpouring of hearts agitated by joy or sorrow in the common prayers and petitions of the family? How tragic is the confession of a mother who pleads in behalf of the family altar in the Christian Observer: "One of the greatest regrets of my life is that my eldest son (eighteen years old) passed to his reward without having heard his father's and mother's voice lifted in prayer to God at the family altar. O fathers and mothers, would to God I could tell you how intensely I feel the sinfulness of this neglect!"

#### "AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE"

The avalanche of domestic misunderstanding that starts insignificantly from some small, selfish act and soon assumes devastating proportions can be averted only by the sincerity of resolution which renews Joshua's promise of old, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Josh. 24:15). A home built on this resolution may be shaken by the storms of unemployment, illness, suffering, and death; but it will have a peace which a self-indulgent world knows not, for it will have Christ. Its walls may witness some of the tragedies bred by survivals of selfishness; but self-sacrifice and forbearance will triumph, for Christ will hallow the relation of husband to wife and of parents to children. In that home, sons and daughters, rising above sense-level pleasures to the more abundant life, will have the spiritual basis on which achieving careers may be built, the foundation knowledge for which St. Paul immortalizes the memories of Eunice and Lois (2 Tim. 3:15). That home, in short, will be a pillar support for the arch of national wel-fare, a fortress of Christ's faith, and a haven of spiritual peace for all who are sheltered within its walls. For that home, that altar-building, Scripture-searching home, and that alone, is the home of abiding happiness.

### THE SECOND MARRIAGE

She is at liberty to be married to whom she will - 1 Cor. 7:39

When before God's altar and in the presence of chosen witnesses a young man and a young woman pledge themselves "until death you do part," the sorrow for which this promise provides seems a remote unreality. The specter of death never recedes so completely as in that happiest of all hours, when love and laughter hold undisputed sway over hearts aglow with radiant hope. Yet, in the far-visioned love of a divine Father who "doeth all things well," it happens too frequently for our human affections that the cold clutch of death intrudes and separates the two partners in pilgrimage on that journey which at the moment of marriage seemed a long, almost interminable, path of perpetually deepening blessings. For an average American couple the bride has six chances in ten of being left a widow, while her husband has four chances in ten of becoming a widower. (Report of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, X, 10: Joint Expectation of Life of Married Couples.) So we have many Orphas and Ruths, young wives bereft of their helpmates in the early years of their marriage, just as there are thousands of young husbands who, crushed in helpless grief, have seen the chill of death silence their youthful brides forever.

In the bitterness of these bereavements Christian courage must express itself. Only deep, unswerving faith in the goodness of God can accept the death of a companion for life as an evidence of Heaven's guidance. However, some brave souls have clearly shown this spiritual mastery. The young clergyman engaged to the sister of the late Sir James Barrie, Scotch novelist, was thrown from a horse and killed three weeks before the day appointed for the wedding. At that time Barrie wrote the following letter to the congregation at Bower, the bereaved parish of the young minister, and asked that it be read from the pulpit:

"To you, at the grave of him who was in three weeks' time to become her husband, my sister sends her love. She has not physical strength to be with you just now in body; but she is with you in spirit, and God is near her, and she is not afraid. You are her loved ones; for it was you who, under God, called him to Bower and gave him the manse to which he was about to bring her; and as he loved you, she loves you. God, who gave His Son for the redemption of the world, has told her that He had need of the disciple's life also and that he died to bring his people of Bower to God's knees. So God chose His own way and took her Jim, her dear young minister, and she says, 'God's will be done'; and she thanks Him for taking away so suddenly only one who was ready to face his Maker without a moment's warning. His great goodness, she says to you, in not taking some one who was unprepared, is her comfort and should be yours. And she prays that Mr. Winter's six months' ministry among you and his death among you while doing his duty has borne, and will continue to bear, good fruit. And me, and will always she will so pray, and she asks you to pray for her. And she says that you are not to grieve for her overmuch, for she is in God's keeping." (J. A. Hammerton, Barrie, the Story of a Genius, page 173.)

The bereaved need the faith which has repeatedly found its heroic expression in the Christian hymnal. Anne Steele experienced one of the hardest aflictions that can come to a woman. Her lover was drowned only a few hours before their wedding-day; yet her faith triumphed, and she could look to Jesus with this resignation:

Give me a calm and thankful heart,
From every murmur free;
The blessings of Thy grace impart
And make me live to Thee.

A Christian mother of five children (one of them suffering with tuberculosis of the hip and ankle) facing the imminent death of her husband through the ravages of tuberculosis of the throat and lungs, writes me: "Our dear father is very near the end of his journey here. Almost any day the Lord Jesus will take him home, where he will no longer have to suffer so terribly and where his poor, tired body will be at rest. It is hard to give him up, for we are both young. He is only forty-three, and I am thirty-four, and we had hoped for many years of life together, working in His vineyard and being with our children; but now we shall all be that much nearer to heaven because he will be there."

It is this faith for which every young husband and wife should pray with increasing fervor; for only in this light can we see light. As the soothing hand of time effaces the sharpness of the wound, it frequently happens that the question of a second marriage presents itself.

In few issues of home-life have opinions run in more crossed directions. Heathen widows have always had but few civil and social rights, and even these have usually been disregarded. Conventions and customs operate to make them the most unfortunate of their down-trodden sex. The suttee, the self-immolation of the Hindu widow on the funeral pyre that consumes her lord husband's remains, has been outlawed by the British; but a writer in Gandhi's Young India (November 11, 1926, cited by Katherine Mayo in Mother India, p. 84) describes the destiny of an Indian relict who has been turned adrift after the death of her husband: "She must live by charity — or by prostitution, into which she not seldom falls. And her dingy, ragged figure, her bristly, shaven head, even though its stubble be white over the haggard face of unhappy age, is often to be seen in temple crowds or in the streets of pilgrimage çities, where sometimes niggard piety doles her a handful of rice. As to remarriage, that in orthodox Hinduism is impossible. ... Whether the widow be an infant and a stranger to the man whose death, she is told, was caused by her sins, or whether she be twenty and of his bed and board, orthodoxy forbids her remarriage."

Nor is the Hindu victimizing of widows coarser than other pagan perversions. In New Guinea a widow must cover her face for half a year after her husband's demise; and every day during this period she must crawl, animal-like, on her hands and knees to his grave. Because her face must be concealed during these pilgrimages to the dead, other women of the tribe lead her with a halter. In Papua custom compels a widow to wear the skull of her departed spouse on a chain around her neck, and this all the days of her life. In other sections of the same island the wearing of the widow's veil, a heavy cloth completely covering the entire head, is so rigorously enforced that any neglect of this ceremonious torture entitles the male kinfolk of the deceased husband to kill the offending widow. In China widows are often driven to suicide, chiefly because the relatives of the husband try to force them into a life of shame. In Nias the widow is frequently sold to another man on the day of her husband's burial. An Associated Press dispatch of June 12, 1933, tells of the discovery of two aboriginal villages on the island of New Britain (part of the Bismarck Archipelago) in which abhorrent rites of widow-slaughter are still ceremonialized. The patrol officer reports that, when one of these Melanesians dies, his widow insists on being strangled so that her liberated spirit may follow her husband into the other world. The account continues: "On some occasions the men, being afraid of consequences, have refused to strangle a woman. Then it sometimes happens that the widow takes off her grass skirt and hands it to the men, telling them to put it on and saying they are only women and not real men. This so shames them that they reluctantly kill her according to custom. The consummation of the ritual is the duty of the widow's brother or her nephews, who wind a native bark cloth around her neck and tighten it until she is choked." So viciously does paganism stigmatize widowhood and ban the possibility of remarriage!

#### THE PROTEST OF CHRISTIANITY

This brutality stands in defiant opposition to the sympathetic position of Holy Scripture. In its humane attitude the entire Word of God shows particular consideration for bereaved wives. Passage after passage in the Old Testament forbids the disregard and defrauding of widows (Ex. 22:22; Deut. 14:29; 16:11, 14; 24: 17-21; Is. 1:17; Jer. 7:6; 22:3, and many others). Even the casual Bible-reader will recall the providential support extended to the widow of Zarephath through Elijah. In the New Testament the Savior's "woe" is hurled at the profiteering scribes and Pharisees, who mercilessly "devour widows' houses" (Matt. 23:14). St. Luke is notably concerned with offering these bereft women adequate thought and care; for the writings of the beloved physician contain more references to widowhood than are found in the three other gospels. He tells of the eighty-four-year-old widow Hannah (Luke 2:36 ff.); of the widow of Nain (7:12); the importunate widow (18:3); the widow and her mite (21:2); the neglect of the Grecian widows in the first church (Acts 6:1); Dorcas, the friend of widows (9:39). Toward the end of the New Testament we have the well-known definition of "pure religion and undefiled" by St. James (chap. 1:27), which begins with the admonition "to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction." From the earliest days of the Church widows were therefore attracted to Christianity and were privileged to play a prominent part in the first missionary endeavors.

With the exception of the Old Testament restriction prohibiting the high priest from marrying a widow (Lev. 21:14), the Scriptures recognize the right of remarriage. This principle was endorsed by the example of Ruth, the ancestress of our blessed Lord; it was sanctioned by the Old Testament custom of successive marriages when a brother had left a childless widow (Deut. 25:5 ff. - levirate marriage, part of the Jewish civil law, designed to perpetuate the family name, but of no binding force for us); and it is definitely approved for our age by the sweeping statement of St. Paul: "The wife is bound by the Law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord" (1 Cor. 7:39).

It is sometimes urged, however, that the approval of the great apostle is rather negative evidence, because he adds: "But she [the widow] is happier if she so abide," namely, in her widowhood (v. 40) ; and earlier in the chapter he states: "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I"(v. 8). But this unique section of St. Paul's correspondence must be understood in the light of the remarks with which the great apostle has framed his opinion. For at the beginning of the chapter (v.7), in the words "I speak this by permission and not of commandment"; in the middle (v. 12), in the statement "To the rest speak I, not the Lord"; and at the end (v. 40), in the conclusion "after my judgment," St. Paul emphasizes that he has received no divine revelation on this question but that he is expressing his private conviction, which the Holy Spirit has perpetuated. The apostle expects, as he explicitly states, only those to follow his instruction on this point who have the gift of continence which he enjoys. And the whole chapter must be regarded as presenting a point of view suggested both by the missionary opportunities confronting the Church at that time and by the chaotic conditions surrounding Christian congregations in the era of persecution. For the final verdict of the same apostle is this: "I will therefore that the younger women" (i.e., the widows, as the context shows) "marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully" (1 Tim. 5:14). While the apostle held that some widows could attain to the highest happiness of life in the service of their Savior, he also knew that amid the perilous social problems which would face them the normal course would usually be the less dangerous.

These wide, sympathetic principles of Scripture are altogether beneficial. Here is a young woman whom death has robbed of a devoted husband's love. She is left, as is often the case, without support for her children and without sufficient means for the maintenance of her home. Even if the financial resources are adequate, she faces life bereft of the guiding and stabilizing influence of a helpmate, confronted with the picture of that lonely widowhood which Washington Irving called a "living monument of real grief" and doomed for life to be "bowed down with age and sorrow at the altar of her God, offering up the prayers and praises of a pious, though a broken, heart." While a second marriage may lack some of the romance and intensity of feeling which marked the first, who will not agree that to this woman and her children a second and happy marriage would be a blessing?

#### DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES IN REMARRIAGE

That the early Church Fathers did not agree in recommending remarriage is evident from Augustine's "On the Good of Widow-hood" (Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Vol. III, p. 460), where despite evident misgivings he expresses this sweeping summary: "I say to every widow, You will be more blessed if you shall have so continued." About the same time Innocent I castigates the priests who had married widows and insists that the clergy be permitted to take as wives none but virgins.

Remarriage presents some difficulties, it is true. Not the least of these is the danger of comparisons. In the fourteenth century Paloa di Gertaldo penned this pointed paragraph of warning against second marriages (Crump and Jacob, The Legacy of the Middle Ages, p. 424): "If thou wilt never be able to satisfy her, and every time thou refusest her anything she may ask of thee she will say, 'My other husband did not treat me thus!' Yet, truly, if thou hast already had another wife, thou mayest take her with greater safety, and if she saith, 'My other husband did not treat me thus,' or, 'Blessed be the soul of So-and-so,' thou canst reply, Blessed be the soul of Madonna So-and-so, who did not cause me this tribulation every day!'"

Dr. Johnson's indefatigable biographer, Boswell, records a conversation with his distinguished friend that stresses a happier side of this question: "When I censured a gentleman of my acquaintance for marrying a second time, as it showed a disregard of his first wife, he [Johnson] said, 'Not at all, sir. On the contrary, were he not to marry again, it might be concluded that his first wife had given him a disgust to marriage; but by taking a second wife, he pays the highest compliment to the first by showing that she made him so happy as a married man that he wishes to be so a second time?' So ingenious a turn did he give to this delicate question." The sentiments of Gouverneur Morris must have been similar. When that early American statesman died, he left a large fortune to his wife but made the provision in his will that, if she married again, the income was to be doubled.

The second marriage often finds the remarried bride more adept in housekeeping, more experienced in family affairs, and, in general, better prepared to meet the expectations of her new hus-band. It is not surprising therefore that the second marriage of a woman is often more successful than an impartial observer might expect. In England, with its 2,000,000 more women than men, many thousands of pounds sterling have been saved for the pension fund because of the remarriage of war widows. Their appeal as homemakers is definitely stronger than that of many younger women who glory in economic independence.

A second marriage for a man, however, presents a somewhat different aspect. We remember that in the postapostolic Church this union was almost universally forbidden in the case of the clergy. The animosity against clerical remarriage rested upon a strictly literal interpretation of Titus 1:6, where the bishop is required to be "the husband of one wife." While this apostolic ordinance is usually explained as a prohibition of the polygamy prevalent in many sections of the Mediterranean world at that time, this negative attitude toward remarriage of the clergy has survived until the present time in the Greek Catholic Church. It is commonly said of priests' wives in this communion that their position is far more exalted and their treatment much more considerate than that of the wives of the laity, since clerical remarriage is ecclesiastically tabu.

A young father upon whom death has thrust the care of children normally can find help in a second marriage, a course followed by an increasing number of widowers. (Cp. the American Mercury, January, 1931, pp. 46 49, for "Notes on Marriage," in which Prof. Wm. T. Ogburn shows that, while middle-aged widows tend not to remarry, middle-aged widowers do.) But the woman who remarries (or the young woman who marries a widower) must take into prayerful consideration the specter of disheartening associations that sometimes cluster about the word "stepmother." It is difficult to overestimate the actual problems confronting a conscientious young woman who becomes the legal mother of motherless children. The daily contact with little ones to whom she may come as an utter stranger and at best as a considerate friend, the supplanting of the first mother's love in these young hearts, the conquest of inherent prejudices, and the winning of children's confidence are tasks that challenge the highest and best of true woman-liness. That this challenge can be met is proved by those innumerable examples of maternal adaptability in which a Christian stepmother by sacrifice, prayer, character, and self-adaptation has triumphed over these obstacles in a manner which has pleased God and cheered men.

However, if a second marriage unites an elderly widower with a very young woman, they must be prepared for the probability that this marriage will be regarded in a definitely unfavorable light. All uncertainty vanishes, and remarriage is usually condemned even by fair minds, when it is consummated immediately after the burial of the first wife.

In spite of the difficulties besetting those who venture upon the sea of matrimony for a second time, Christians usually have every reason to feel genuinely optimistic about remarriage. In his marital life with the widowed Martha Custis the Father of our Country demonstrated the possibility of making a second marriage notably happy. Two of the other great Americans that illumined the first century of our national life, Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln, came from homes where the father had taken another life-mate after the death of the first. Lincoln's stepmother, Sarah Bush, was noted for her "sprightliness and industry." There is little doubt that the development of young Abraham, who was continually under her care from his tenth to his twenty-fourth year, was remarkably influenced by her sympathetic attitude toward his desire for learning. This statement is credited to her, and investigators of Lincoln lore accept its authenticity: "I induced my husband to permit Abe to read and study at home as well as in school. At first he was not easily reconciled to it, but finally he, too, seemed willing to encourage him to a certain extent. We took particular care not to disturb him and let him read on and on until he quit of his own accord." There might have been no great Emancipator had there been no second marriage in the Lincoln household.

Among other notables who remarried, we recall the brilliant cantor of St. Thomas's, Leipzig, Johann Sebastian Bach; in the domain of science, leaders like Elie Metchnikoff, who was saved from mediocrity, despair, and suicide through a second marriage to an exceptional young woman. From then on, a biographer tells us, "Metchnikoff's life was much less disastrous. His hands began to catch up with his precocious brain; he was learning to do experiments." (Microbe Hunters, by Paul De Kruif, p. 211.)

That great missionary to Burma Adoniram Judson was married three times. Edwin T. Dahlberg (Youth and the Homes of Tomorrow, p. 135) reviews his marital experiences and presents this verdict: "In each instance the marriage proved to be an ideal relationship in every way. It was the greatness of Judson's own soul as well as the nobility of the women he married that made this possible. His daughter-in-law writes of him that he never permitted any day to become commonplace. He was forever pinning little notes for his wife and children on the curtains of the windows or slipping through little messages of endearment from his study or bringing in a bouquet of roses. He was a great man of God with a radiant Christian faith; and when his fortunes were joined to the lives of three lovely women in succession, each of whom was ready to share in the arduous labors and sufferings of his pioneer mission-field, a beautiful home-life resulted in each instance."

#### NO DEATH-BED PLEDGES!

With such precedents — and the list is but barely begun by these names — and with the realization that the Scriptures offer no bar against remarriage, the prejudice attached to second matrimonial careers should normally vanish. Frequently a marriage partner demands of the other, especially on a bed of sickness or death, the promise to refrain from remarriage. Even Dr. Johnson admitted the force of this temptation. Boswell recounts: "He [Johnson] owned that he once had almost asked a promise of Mrs. Johnson that she would not marry again, but had checked himself. Indeed, I cannot help thinking that in his case the request would have been unreasonable; for if Mrs. Johnson forgot or thought it no injury to the memory of her first love, the husband of her youth and the father of her children, to make a second marriage, why should she be precluded from a third should she be so inclined? In Johnson's persevering fond appropriation of his Tetty, even after her decease, he seems totally to have overlooked the prior claim of the honest Birmingham trader."

These promises should not be exacted because a pledge of this upon the life kind may lay an unnecessary burden upon the life of a surviving husband or wife and thwart their happiness. Frequently the motive which seeks to exact this promise is based on a misconception of personal relations in the "life of the world to come." Those who oppose remarriage through the fear of divided interest in the next life can find no support in our Lord's answer to the quibbling Sadducees on this point (Matt. 22, 23 ff.; see next chapter).

It is a serious matter, this second marriage. The obvious inferences for all clear-visioned Christians must be these: Led by the guiding hand of God, they must strive to make their first marriage supremely happy. With constant intercession they must regularly invoke the providence of Almighty God against the misfortunes of untimely death and sudden bereavement. And when under the direction of Heaven a second marriage becomes advisable, they implore the divine benediction upon this new relation with that increased earnestness which the peculiar difficulties of the new union dictate.

### THE REUNION IN HEAVEN

What are these which are arrayed in white robes? - Rev. 7:13

When William Booth stood at his wife's grave, his head bowed low by the weight of crushing grief, he spoke these heart-wrung words: "I have never turned from her these forty years for any journeyings on my mission of mercy but I longed to get back and have counted the weeks, days, and hours which should take me again to her side. And now she has gone away for the last time. What, then, is there left for me to do? ... My work plainly is to fill up the weeks, the days, the hours, and cheer my poor heart as I go along with the thought that, when I have served my Christ and my generation according to the will of God, ... then I trust that she will bid me welcome to the skies."

In one of her last letters the widow of Nathaniel Hawthorne penned this ineradicable hope, which became an anchor of comfort in her soul's sorrow: "I have an eternity, thank God, in which to know him more and more, or I should die in despair.'

When Andrew Jackson lay on his death-bed at the Hermitage, surrounded by his children, relatives, and Negro servants, he deliberately spoke this valedictory: "My dear children, do not weep for me. It is true I am going to leave you. I am well aware of my situation; I have suffered much bodily pain, but my sufferings are as nothing compared with that which our blessed Savior endured on that accursed cross that we might all be saved who put our trust in Him." After he had bidden farewell to the members of his family, he spoke once more for nearly a half hour concerning their soul's salvation and concluded, as his eyes lingered on the portrait of his beloved wife, Rachel, whom he had mourned for many years: "My dear children and friends and servants, I hope and trust to meet you all in heaven, both white and black." He paused and repeated: "Both white and black."

John Newton was attached to his wife with deep affection, for she had repeatedly helped him cling to the faith. However, when death took her, he asked God for added strength, and his prayer was answered. He preached his wife's funeral sermon, choosing as his text the words of Hab. 3:18, "I will rejoice in the Lord." Years later he stated that, although his departed wife had not been out of his thought for five minutes since her death, he had not suffered an uncomfortable day since her home-going. He had gone his way resolutely, anticipating a happy reunion with his beloved.

During the Christmas season of 1874, when Charles Kingsley, widely beloved preacher at Westminster Abbey, was told that there was no cure for his wife's illness, he declared that his "own death-warrant was signed with these words." Yet, in the words of a biographer (Charles Kingsley; His Letters and Memories of His Life; edited by his wife, Vol. II, pp. 333 ff.), "his ministrations in the sick-room showed the intensity of his own faith as he strengthened the weak, encouraged the fearful, and in the light of the Cross of Christ and the love of God spoke of an eternal reunion and the indestructibility of that ... love which, if genuine, can seem to be severed only for a brief moment.... 'But,' he added, it is not darkness you are going to, for God is Light. It is not lonely, for Christ is with you. It is not an unknown country, for Christ is there.' And when the dreary interval before reunion was mentioned, he spoke of the possibility of all consciousness of time being so destroyed that what would be long years to the survivor might be only a moment to the separated soul that had passed over the River of Death."

Another widely known British preacher, the late John Clifford, wrote these lines to a friend on the afternoon of his wife's death: "For fifty-seven years and a half we have lived one life, one in love, one in devotion to the Church of Christ, one in faith and hope, and we shall be one in the heaven of the Great Beyond. Since February 27, 1860, we have been one, wholly one, inseparably one; and though her dear body lies still in the next room, her face lovely in the calm of death, yet our unity is real and abiding — fifty-seven years and a half of ever-increasing love and trust and joy."

In answer to a questionnaire concerning the scientific evidence that the human soul exists after death, Dr. W. W. Keen of Philadelphia recently wrote: "I am fully convinced that, when I pass from this world, I shall meet my dear wife, who was taken from me forty years ago last July, and I thank God for that belief. I thank God for faith as well as science."

Now, are these hopes of a heavenly reunion well founded? Is this earnest expectation that bereaved Christians have confidently voiced in the aching, breaking pain of parting a delusion or deathless truth? Will we meet with

... raptured greetings
On Canaan's happy shore?

Is it true that, when

...knitting severed friendships up
Where partings are no more,
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle
That brimmed with tears of late, —
Orphans no longer fatherless,
Nor widows desolate?

#### ETERNITY - NO NIRVANA

The Christian believes with an unalterable conviction and inner persuasion that immortality is a fact, an inviolable verity, mysterious and transcendental, yet as real and personal as every pledge of Christ. He believes that in the resurrection, assured by His Savior's Easter victory over death, individual identity is not submerged. To him the future existence is no semiconscious Nirvana.

This hope is not merely a pious wish; nor does it rest upon the universal belief of men through the ages. It is true that with the exception of agnostic doubt and atheistic dissent men have consistently clung to the conviction that in their future Elysium, no matter with what lines they may draw their picture of the here-after, the departed will recognize each other. Blind pagans sacrificed the widows of their departed leaders on imperial funeral pyres so that these might accompany their deceased husbands into the society of the next life. Cultured heathen like Socrates and Cicero draw the picture of life after death with the consoling reflection that it will bring them the privilege of conversing with other great minds. Disillusioned Stoics have committed suicide in the fervent belief that this act would reestablish broken contacts and reunite them with their deceased friends. All this, amplify it as we will, does not guarantee the Christian an answer to that plaintive query asked by every heart in the bitterness of bereavement, Will we know each other in heaven? Will we be gathered together there with our dear ones? Is it true that -

The loved and parted here below
Meet ne'er to part again?

#### THE COMFORT OF THE SCRIPTURES

These eternal expectancies of God's children radiant in the gems of the Church's treasured hymnody and chiseled into the marble memorials that Christian devotion has erected on God's acre, rest upon the statements of that Word which is to be a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path, even when reason deserts us.

The Scriptures assume this truth and would have God's children accept it as granted. The Bible never denies this hope; it never argues it; but it does present a long list of testimonies which point straight to the joy of reunion in heaven.

According to the promise of our Savior the personal identities are preserved in the next world. He tells us that in consequence of the Church's missionary work "many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 8:11). If this passage is to be understood in its original force and meaning, it must be interpreted as presupposing that the three patriarchs are personal entities and are recognized in the realms of eternity.

With impressive clarity we see the evidence of personal recognition on the Mount of Transfiguration, when the disciples without previous instructions immediately recognize the two departed prophets Moses and Elijah (Matt. 17:3). If these commanding figures of the Old Testament could be identified by the disciples who had never before seen them, then in heaven, where our knowledge shall be made perfect and our vision clarified, there must be similar recognition.

The questions of the elder in the Apocalypse: "What are these which are arrayed in white robes? And whence come they?" and their answer: "These are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Rev. 7:13) cannot be correctly interpreted in any other way that by assuming that these saints in glory are recognized as martyrs who have laid down their lives for the glorification of Christ.

Endorsing this truth, the apostle writes to his Thessalonians and, asking: "What is our hope, our joy, our crown of rejoicing?" answers: "Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? For ye are our glory and crown" (1 Thess. 2: 19, 20). Here St. Paul openly declares that he will rejoice in eternity over his converts from Thessalonica, whom he will recognize in the presence of his Savior. The promise holds little comfort unless it predicates personal identity.

A similar conviction animated the believers of the Old Testa-ment. When one of God's heroes in the Old Covenant days passed into eternity, the records tell us he was gathered unto his people. Scoffing Bible critics may interpret this as a reference to the family tomb; but there is no evidence that family crypts were in general use. If the doctrine of the resurrection is so clear and vivid in the Old Testament faith that palsied Job can break through the cynicism of his counselors and declare: "I know that my Redeemer liveth, ... and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another" (Job 19:25-27), how can there be any desire to restrict the implications of this "being gathered unto the fathers" to the sepulchral rest in the family mausoleum? Must we not believe that, when David, tormented over the death of his child, declared: "I shall go to him" (2 Sam. 12:23), he who foresaw the resurrection of Christ, believed that death would reunite him with his infant son?

It is noteworthy that, when the Savior describes the heavens of glory, He adapts Himself both to the limitations of human speech as well as to the inadequacy of the human mind. Nevertheless He speaks of His Father's house with its many mansions, where each of the believers finds the prepared place after the race of life has run its course. This blessed home is not an abode of indefinable spirits that have submerged or lost their personality; it would be unwarranted to picture these heavenly mansions and the celestial communion of the saints without believing in the mutual and individual recognition of the children of God for whom these everlasting dwellings have been prepared by Christ.

With the additional emphasis that the Word of God lays upon the individual in eternity, the names of the elect recorded in the Book of Life, the acknowledgment of each faithful believer by the Savior Himself before His Father in heaven, Dives beholding Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom, no doubt remains in the Christian's mind. He believes that, when the New Testament speaks of "the whole family in heaven" (Eph. 3:15), it includes in this vast picture of the ten thousand times ten thousand the recognition of those who were united in the Spirit-blessed family here on earth.

### "AS THE ANGELS OF GOD IN HEAVEN"

Yet it is no materialistic heaven that reunites the Christian family. Lord Northcliffe is reported to have sent spirit messages to Miss Louise Owen, who for twenty years served as his private secretary. In these "celestial" revelations the "spirit" of the British publisher and war enthusiast allegedly gave the world these instructions through his amanuensis: "Tell them how one faces the music over here; no hush, no secrecy, no hiding behind others. Tell them that this side is full of regrets and remorse for wasted oppotunities. Tell them we are all working cooperatively over here to bring peace and understanding." The editor's "spirit" also declared that, when Miss Owen was on the lecture platform bringing his message to the British people, he would be at her side. As other who were said to be working in close harmony with him he mentioned Bonar Law, formerly Tory premier of Great Britain; Keir Hardie, the first Labor-Socialist member of the House of Commons; Lord Kitchener; and Sir Henry Wilson, some of whom had been vehemently opposed to Lord Northcliffe during the war.

The mystic Emanuel Swedenborg draws a materialistic picture of marriage in the hereafter with wedding-feasts and sharp social differentiation. He writes: "I have also been permitted to see how marriages are contracted in the heavens. As everywhere, in heaven those who are alike are united, and those who are unlike are separated, so every society in heaven consists of those who are alike. Like are brought to like, not by themselves but by the Lord; and in like manner consorts whose minds can be joined into one are drawn together; and consequently at first sight they inmostly love each other and see themselves to be consorts and enter into marriage. For this reason all marriages in heaven are from the Lord alone. They have also marriage-feasts, and these are attended by many; but the festivities differ in different societies." (Sec. 383, "Marriages in Heaven," in Heaven and Its Wonders and Hell.)

The late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in picturing his "Summer-land," the higher plane of a future existence, declares more pointedly that marriage will exist in the hereafter just as on earth but "in less gross form," whatever that is. No children will be born in this spirit world, and there can be no unsuccessful marriages. Men who have been happily married on earth renew their marital alliance in the hereafter, while the unhappily married never meet again. (New York World, April 11, 1922.)

These modern counterparts to a Moslem paradise run counter to the plain pronouncements of Christ. When the Sadducees, who scoffed at the idea of the resurrection, put the catch-question to Him concerning the woman who had married the seven brothers: "In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?" the Savior answers: "Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage" (Matt. 22:28 ff.).

This revelation of Christ has been regarded with mixed feelings and interpreted with mutually exclusive meanings. Some have believed that the Savior's words preclude only the making of new marriages, so that those who were single while on earth will remain unmarried in heaven, while the family relationships continue. Others have veered to the opposite extreme and have been disturbed by the foreboding fear that husbands and wives will be oblivious of one another in eternity.

In this contradiction we must find the key to the explanation in Christ's supplementary statement. They, the blessed departed, He tells us, "are as the angels of God in heaven." When His words "They neither marry nor are given in marriage" are viewed in this light, they signify only that in heaven human marriage with its limitations and earth-bound restrictions will stop and give way to a higher spiritual life and to an angel-like existence. Not a syllable either directly or by inference implies that a Christian husband and wife or believing parents and their children will not recognize one another. We are simply told that in the sublimity of heaven, marriage as we know it now will no longer exist. Let us not speculate where Scripture has not spoken. We are utterly incapable of understanding "the glory that shall be revealed in us." In the absence of any contrary indication may not the Christian, knowing the increasing of joy and the immeasurable endowment of happiness that awaits him when he beholds his Savior face to face, believe that his relations with his beloved, hallowed by the new holiness, will be spiritualized in the beauty of the celestial glories?

#### THE APPEAL OF HEAVENLY REUNION

This picture of eternity with our loved ones and the greater company of saints of all lands and ages, a beatified existence without suffering, disappointment, pain, or sorrow, directs its insistent appeal to our Christian families. It pleads for personal piety and that faith without which no man can see God. It asks us individually to weigh with exacting care every thought and word that involves our everlasting destiny. Family connections alone admit no one into heaven. An unbelieving husband may have his religion written in his wife's name while on earth; but when he crosses the bar, he will find that his own name must be written in the Book of Life. An indifferent mother may send her children to Sunday-school while she herself remains away from the church; but her children's faith will not rise up to claim for her the title to a heavenly mansion.

A heart-breaking thought on our earthly pilgrimage is the very suggestion of the possibility that those loved ones who are nearest and dearest to us here may be eternally separated from us hereafter because of unbelief and wilful neglect of their Savior's love. Let impetuous, head-strong youth realize the overpowering importance of Christian oneness in faith and understand that, if two cannot walk together in Christian devotion on their earthly pilgrimage, they cannot enter heaven together.

This prospect of mutually shared glory must also stimulate within us a holy desire to make our earthly homes symbols of our heavenly dwellings and our family life here under the cross of afliction a constant preparation for life with the united family in heaven under the crown of exaltation. Christian husbands and wives who know the blessings of eternity will concede that the few years of this earthly sojourn are too fleeting and precious to be marred by bickering, self-assertiveness, and aloofness. With their eyes steadfastly focused on the heavenly homeland, they will rather endeavor to bring their own marital lives under the foregleam of this radiant eternity and hallow their relationship by sacrifice, forbearance, and self-effacing love. To them the three or four decades which constitute the average span of married life will be but a short period of preparation for the never-ending fellowship with "the whole family in heaven," a prelude, weak and wavering though it may be, to the hallelujah chorus sung by the white-robed saints before the throne of the Lamb.

What more powerful antidote to the crushing sorrows of bereavement than this firmly founded faith in a better life to come and an everlasting companionship that can never be severed by disease or death? What more soothing comfort than to know that

...when man's dearest dies, 'tis then he goes
To that old balm that heals the centuries' woes;
Then Christ's own cry in all the streets is rife:
"I am the Resurrection and the Life"?

What brighter light of illumination by which to dispel the clouds of death's anguish than the radiance of Christ's blood-sealed promise that, when our bodies, sown in corruption, are raised in incorrup-tion, we shall stand glorified at our Savior's side, -

There where the good and blest,
Those we love most and best,
And where we, too, shall rest! -
Heaven is our home.
