##8.6 QUICKSAND COUNSEL

Is counsel perished? - Jer. 49:7

Is there a widening breach between young people and the clergy? Some indications suggest a disturbing answer. In a questionnaire sent to eighty-eight Protestant youth groups in churches of ten different denominations one question asked pointedly: "Do you feel you can go to your minister with your intimate personal problems?" More than two thirds answered in the negative.

It would be folly to deduce sweeping conclusions on the basis of this percentage. In my Church, confirmation instruction and the opportunities for friendly pastoral help afforded by the announcements for Communion combine to increase the confidence which our young people place in their spiritual leaders. Yet even here, in the more personal issues of courtship and marriage, we find that the pastor's direction is often discarded in much the same manner as parental counsel is neglected.

Too often the answers to the questions of the heart are sought from counselors whose decisions may lead to matrimonial debacle. Here is a young woman in need of advice for the perplexities of her private life. Here is a young husband awakening to the possibility of imminent discord, yet yearning for restored harmony. Here is a couple pausing eagerly on the threshold of married life, searching for the key to the portals of domestic bliss. And where do they try to find the assurance of happiness or the path to deeper mutual understanding?

### NEWSPAPER COUNSELORS

Not a few young people are ready to bare their private affairs to strangers and to have crisis issues of their lives decided not by parents or pastor but by the pronouncements of newspaper counselors whom they have never seen. Consider, for example, the activities of "Dorothy Dix." She is said to receive an average of 500 letters a day. While this may be press-agent exaggeration, her philosophies of love and her advice in domestic problems are syndicated in 150 newspapers, with a daily circulation approaching 20,000,000. Or think of "Beatrice Fairfax," who claims, "In the last ten years I have read a million letters." Her newspapers call her "the nation's preeminent counselor on social decorum and on personal problems." She has become a sort of Delphic oracle, whose opinion has been sought, we are told, in as many as 800 letters in one day.

There can be no doubt that many who find themselves confronted by conflict have no parental guide or friendly adviser to whom they can turn. Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt tells her magazine audiences: "It is hard to find just the friend we should like to talk to. Often it is easier to write to some one whom we do not expect ever to see. We can say things which we cannot say to the average individual we meet in our daily lives." Newspaper columnists have not been slow to seize upon this White House en-dorsement. Doris Blake, the professional confidante employed by the Chicago Tribune, says that Mrs. Roosevelt's attitude expresses exactly her own psychology. She insists: The fact "that confidences are respected, viewed sympathetically no matter what the problem, advised upon to the very best of our ability, makes departments like this one just that friend with whom you may safely discuss your troubles."

Yet when this counsel is commercialized, — and it usually is in newspaper features, - it becomes basically objectionable. Some of these self-enthroned arbiters are disqualified by their own marital experiences. A Mid-Western newspaper counselor in questions of the home found that she had been dealing with apid theories when her own daughter left town in a blaze of scandal to adopt a short-lived career as bandit. A noted "authority" on questions of the home and domestic management lives in a luxurious hotel in the nation's capital. A Chicago "love professor" and author of a correspondence course entitled "The Master-key to Love" was sued for divorce after a three months' marriage. His abused wife charged that the "professor" struck her thirteen times at one occasion and knocked her through three doorways.

In addition to the cheapness involved in baring intimate heart secrets to an utter stranger who receives money for listening, the direction offered by this craft of counselors often becomes a Fata Morgana that lures marriages on the reefs.

An example of Dorothy Dix's advice and her support of divorce is given in the following question and answer from the St. Louis Star-Times:

"Dear Miss Dix: I am thirty-six. My wife is thirty-four. She is a beautiful woman. I am a hopeless cripple from an incurable case of arthritis. My wife had to go out to work, and we were so poor that she lost several positions because she was so shabbily dressed. She has met a wealthy business man, and they have fallen violently in love with each other. She has gone to live with him, and of course he gives her every luxury and wants to marry her. A week ago she came to me and begged me to give her a divorce, told me that, if I would, plenty of money would be supplied me, and I would be placed in a home for incurables. She said that, whether or not I gave her the divorce, she would continue to live with this man, as she loved him better than life. I flew into a rage and told her I would never give her a divorce. But what do you think I should do? — BROKEN-HEARTED."

Answer.—"In judging your wife, you must look at the from her point of view, and that is pitiful, too. Life was hard on her also. It was grinding poverty and exhausting work. It was shabbiness and poor food and anxiety about where the rent was to come from and the food for the next day and nursing a sick, man. No play. No amusement. No gaiety. None of the luxuries and pretty things that women love.

"And she saw this drab and dreary life stretching on for years and years to the end of the chapter. Then this man came along who offered her all of the things she craved — the ease, the comfort, the soft living, the freedom from worry about money. And she was beautiful, and she knew that her good looks would soon go in the slavery she was condemned to, and she was not strong enough to resist the temptation. She did not love you enough; for love is proof against any temptation, however great.

"It was a heartless thing for her to leave you; but it was her life against yours, her happiness against yours, and selfishness won.

"As for what you should do, I think the answer is plain. Give her the divorce she wants and let her legalize her position. You have lost her anyway, and denying her a divorce will be only a petty revenge that will bring you no happiness. And you will have made the gallant gesture of a fine gentleman. – Dorothy Dix

With not a word about sin, the moral and legal condemnation of this divorce, or the sense of loyalty that the Church tries to inspire in Christian wives, this type of newspaper counsel fears neither God nor hell and helps pull the props from the pedestal on which the Scriptures have exalted marriage.

Snatches of the advice which Miss Dix gives to her correspondents on other subjects follow:

"I think that before any young couples marry, they should make a contract in which it would be definitely set forth what proportion of the property the woman is to receive in case of divorce."

"The real cure for divorce is not law nor moral teachings. In the great majority of cases it is simply a railroad or steamship ticket. Nothing else."

"Marriage is a gamble in which you pay your money and take a chance."

"Why unhappy wives stick is a big mystery."

"There are many reasons why the marriage of convenience should have a better chance of lasting than the marriage of love."

"Make a man comfortable, and he will purr like a cat under your hand. Give him a warm hearthstone, and he will not wander from it. Believe me, my daughter, there is no other such recipe for keeping a husband from becoming a philander than to fatten him up and cause him to lose that boyish figure."

A new departure in this counsel-for-marriage move is the newspaper mentor who claims to base his advice on scientific and professional investigations. Typical of this tendency is Dr. Albert C. Wiggam. His mental tests are syndicated throughout the country and he deals largely with questions of marriage and courtship. An examination of his statements shows an evident desire to disrupt accepted beliefs. The Scriptures are entirely set aside, and the attitude of the Church is made the object of innuendo. recent pronouncements of this scientific oracle we find the following questions and answers, which speak unmistakably for themselves:

"Is man naturally polygamous? — Yes. ... However, his sheer intelligence and social position have led him to domesticate himself."

"Is a woman justified in breaking her engagement if her intended will not agree just how the money questions will be answered after marriage? – Yes"

"Do men like the pursuing type of women? - Men do not altogether like to be pursued, but it is part of the world-wide revolt of women to secure independent individuality."

"Should young people with small incomes marry or work and save and wait? — Marry as soon as you are sure that two pay-envelopes will stretch over the rent, food, clothes, and a little recreation."

Whenever a man earns his livelihood by dealing in alleged scientific advice on personal issues, his statements should be scrutinized with exceeding care. When his recommendations involve outspoken opposition to the Scriptures and indulge in "wisecracks" against the Christian religion, his efforts are directly hostile to public welfare and common morality.

### MEDICAL COUNSELORS

More dangerous are the medical counselors, whose ranks have swollen into formidable proportions. Contrary to the accepted medical ethics these men have adopted programs of lurid advertising, featuring handbills with scare-line warnings, almanacs, and' street guides interlarded with health talks, professional cards offering the special inducement of reduced prices. All these are freely distributed in the attempt to create a psychology of fear and to lure the unwary into "medical institutes."

It can be shown that some of these "physicians" have secured their medical title through the grinding of diploma mills, as revealed a few years ago in St. Louis. Their blatant publicity, colored as it is with benevolent claims, makes them professional outcasts. The best advice they suggest can be given much more scientifically, sincerely, and reasonably by the family physician.

Some years ago the Chicago Tribune featured detailed exposés of these medical quacks. Summarizing its investigation, the newspaper stated:

"The Tribune has found them [these advertising "specialists' to be organized, backed by ample funds, and buttressed behind expensive legal talent. It has also found much evidence to indicate that their claims of curing diseases are founded largely on buncombe and that their profession is, in fact, that genial, age-old profession of getting money by false pretenses.

"Evidence is in the possession of the Tribune which goes to show that the confidence-men 'specialists' are guilty of graver offenses than the mere petty grafting brought to light. These facts substantiate the fol. lowing charges:

"That the pocket of a patient was picked by a 'doctor' while the patient was on the operating-table.

"That some of the quacks are at least morally and probably legally guilty of killing patients.

"That a number of the quacks have maimed patients for life by malpractice.

"That at least one of the quacks habitually attempts to seduce his women patients.

"That two of the quacks operate their business under assumed names and, living double lives, practice swindling down-town, while posing as respectable doctors in outlying districts.

"The investigators of the Tribune were chosen with a view to using only such men as were perfectly well. To make certain on this point, each investigator, before beginning his work, underwent a careful examination by a competent physician. It was thus made certain that, when the investigators left the Tribune, they were in perfect physical condition. The investigators went directly from the Tribune to the 'specialists' to whom they were assigned. There they were a good deal astonished to learn that they were suffering from various forms of venereal disease. Diagnoses were made in other cases after examinations which seemed aimed not at arriving at the physical condition of the caller but at frightening him into the belief that there was something the matter with him."

In the course of the investigation the shocking extremes to which these charlatans sometimes drive their victims were uncovered. The following is a typical case:

"Here is an example of the awful influence which the quack doctors exercise on the ignorant immigrants of Chicago. The facts, names, and dates were given to the Tribune by officers of the Visiting Nurses' Association. The names are omitted for obvious reasons. A Polish family, living on Archer Avenue, besides the mother and father was composed of ten healthy, ambitious children. The oldest of the children were twin boys, twenty-three years old. One of the twins led a clean, healthy life and was a fine type of physical strength and energy. He brought his pay-envelope home regularly and was frequently promoted by the firm with which he worked.

"One day the son had a dizzy spell. He read an advertisement in one of the foreign newspapers. He went to see a quack doctor in the neighborhood where he lived. The youth had but one interview with the doctor. It lasted only a few minutes. But during that time the doctor impressed a belief on the mind of the healthy boy that he had a horrible disease which would take three years and much money to cure. The boy went home resolved to take his life. He could not bear the expense of the 'treatment' and did not wish to expose his family to the danger of contracting the disease. He became so obsessed with the dread of the disease that he slept in a room by himself, would not come near any of his family, ate alone, and, having washed his own eating utensils, would lock them in a drawer.

"The family physician was asked by the mother to make an examination of the boy. The doctor reported that he was in fine physical condition and there was nothing at all the matter with him. Not convinced, the boy went to six reputable physicians, all of whom told him the quack had lied to get his money. But they could not drive the obsession from the boy's mind. No word from expert authority could beat the idea out of his head which the quack had put in it. He refused to visit any of his relatives or go near them for fear of spreading the contagion. The quack had told him that by having the disease he was endangering his family as well as himself, and this idea the boy stuck to. He broke off an engagement with his sweetheart and, without explaining why, refused to see her again. The family physician became alarmed at the mental condition of the boy and decided the only thing to do was to have another physician examine him and tell him he really had the disease he feared. It was arranged with another physician that the boy should be given some harmless pills after the incorrect diagnosis and was to pay $1 a week until he was 'cured' — mentally cured. The boy seemed somewhat relieved after this ruse was sprung. He took the medicine regularly for several weeks. One morning he was found dead in his bed. He had taken poison. He left a note, saying he could not bear to bring his family into disgrace by his own imprudence." (Nostrums and Quackery, pp. 432 and 433.)

Closely related in its violations of decency is the medical motion-picture that features the origin of life, hygienic issues, and other intimate subjects. Commenting on a screen exhibition in the Chicago Loop, published as "the only true scientific exposé of marriage ever shown," an investigating reporter finds that the promoter, whose "message" is the calculated center of these exhibitions, has an unsavory past with a police record, although imposingly labeled as president of the National Society of Eugenics. "His 'message' is so appallingly crude and nastily nauseating," a reviewer writes, "that at first the stronger-stomached of the audience are inclined toward lusty laughter. However, they gradually succumb to the wizardry of his eloquence, until at the end they are whipped into a frenzy of morbid sensationalism. At that point comes the high-powered salesmanship. Three paper pamphlets dealing with the mating instinct and other problems appertaining thereto are produced and sold for a dollar a set."

The Journal of the American Medical Association (March 2, 1932), investigating this professedly philanthropic lecturer, found that in 1929 New York State authorities forced him to drop the title of "Doctor"; that in 1930 he was arrested in New Orleans on serious charges, but had his case nolle-prossed under the condition that he leave the city immediately; that the booklets which he sells for fifty cents should not cost more than one cent each.

It is hardly necessary to warn intelligent young people against these atrocious illustrated lectures as well as against all anatomy exposures, origin-of-life shows, and similar crudities that flourish brazenly in the midways of most expositions or in the less reputable sections of our cities. It is a caustic commentary on the grasping tendencies of city officials that this vulgar exhibitionism is permitted to thrive with municipal license and sanction. How much better this declaration by the British Board of Film Censors: "Since the inception of the British Board of Film Censors, seven years ago, films have from time to time been submitted for censorship of which it has been said they were produced for the purpose of influencing public opinion or enlisting sympathy on certain subjects. Such films have included the effects of certain diseases, contracted and hereditary, illegal operations, white slavery, race suicide, etc. The Board has consistently refused to issue their certificates for these films."

We need more municipal judges that take the attitude of Philip G. Gilliam, Denver magistrate, who declares: "Now and then a motion-picture is shown of the type commonly known as the sex picture. Such pictures are usually placed at the third-run theater and are advertised as being 'For Adults Only? Whenever these films are shown, there is usually a storm of protest to the authorities to have them stopped. When parties involved are brought into the municipal court for an ordinance prohibiting the showing of obscene pictures, they claim that there is a moral lesson involved and that the pictures are therefore educational. In my opinion these pictures are not educational. They are displayed always with an inference of evil. I personally do not think that the theater is the proper place for sex education. As long as I am on the municipal bench, I am going to have these pictures stopped."

### SCIENTIFIC COUNSEL

By devoting an entire issue of its Annual (more than 270 pages) to the problems of youth in our country, the American Academy of Political and Social Science shows proper concern for one of the most fundamental issues of our days. In discussing the difficulties that confront youth in its vocational guidance, youth in relation to the Church, leisure time, politics and sports, youth and crime, health and mental hygiene, it analyzes some of the hazards that loom ominously before the nation's tomorrow.

Unfortunately, however, some of the presentations are plainly marked by pointed opposition to the Christian ideals and the principles of the Scriptures. This is particularly notable in the discussion entitled "Youth and Marriage. As we have come to expect of such sociological studies, the religious element is completely ignored. That the principles of Jesus Christ and the teachings of the true Christian Church can help young people to live more happily, to enjoy their married life more fully, to stand economic stress and the storm of adversity heroically and with greater sac-rifice, — of this there is not so much as a word.

Instead — and this is a vicious trend in modern sociology - we discover a deliberate rising up against those basic principles of purity and chastity which even plain pagan morality - not to mention the higher ethical elements of Christianity — demands. In this discussion of youth and marriage the writer calmly lists a number of cases in which the code of Christian marital morality is outraged. But these lapses are not treated as moral issues. The whole presentation seems to be oblivious of the fact that we have the Ten Commandments with their prohibition of adultery. Instead the writer, who is "Counselor at the Marriage Council, Philadelphia; Invitation Lecturer at Educational Institutions, the Y. W. C. A.; Vice-President of the Parents' Association of the Haverford Friends School," etc., etc. (all responsible positions in home guidance and family influence), questions the advisability of purity. Specifically she states, "The point made by ... young people of premarital experimentation... raises interesting questions as to the wisdom of dogmatic assertions in regard to chastity." It was bad enough twenty years ago when Russian atheists advanced theories of this kind; but when this program of impurity is condoned and extolled by an organization like the American Academy of Political and Social Science, it is time to protest.

It is shocking to read that "a broad-minded clergyman and physician" helped an unmarried young couple "in trouble" by suggesting a procedure which is contrary to the law and utterly opposed to our Christian morality. This glorification of the "broad-minded clergyman" as opposed to the "narrow-minded preacher" of the Word summarizes the contemptuous regard of some professional social counselors and emphasizes a clear disdain for Christianity as a constructive aid for purity.

The remedy suggested for marriage ills is likewise disappointing. "Those who win through successfully," we are told, "must be trained to accept psychologically what the great biologists have long recognized, namely, that the survival of the individual or of the species is determined to an important degree by the ability to adapt to a changing environment." Psychology and biology are thus to offer saving instruction to our day; but how the adaptation to changed environment is to be attained, how character is to be strengthened, so that these young people can practice self-denial and continence, — these pointed questions of courtship and marriage — are left unanswered.

Somewhat more than two years ago the American Committee on Maternal Welfare decided to make a motion-picture film which would combat "the almost universal ignorance of the problem of motherhood and childbirth." Soon after completion the film was reviewed in four pages of Life, the widely read weekly pictorial magazine.

A clash of conflicting opinions resulted. On the one hand, high officials in Government, education, and public health service offered unqualified endorsements. In Minneapolis a group made up of physicians and their wives, nurses, and medical students voted to endorse the film by a vote of 1,995 to 40. The editor of The Ladies Home Journal, which has been featuring material concerning childbirth, declared, "I want my ten-year-old daughter to see it." Miss Katharine Lenroot, chief of the Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor, wrote: "I heartily approve Life's action in publishing this sequence of pictures. In my opinion it may well be seen by children of adolescent age." On the other hand, police in many cities confiscated the copies of the magazine with these pictures and forbade their sale on the news-stands. Ministers and teachers in large numbers protested against the printing of these four pages of frankly revealing scenes.

We hold that this tendency to "tell all and show all" is not only powerless in character building and negligible in preventing disaster caused by ignorance; it may be definitely destructive. The pictures in Life in no way emphasized the glory of mother-hood. Stressing, as the magazine and the film do, only the biological side, they tend to create an aversion to motherhood.

Nor do we believe that a public magazine or a motion-picture house is the place to reveal these scenes from the most intimate moments of life. The same screen that shows sin, allurement, and seduction, or the same magazine that pictures nudities and caters to the stage, will not offer the proper environment for a presentation of a subject so personal and intimate.

### THE COUNSEL OF SUPERSTITION

That misguided myriads seeking advice in matters of heart and home are trafficking in superstitions with dealers in the forbidden arts is evident from the flourish of the mystic - despite financial stringency and sluggish business. Never before have the purveyors of the occult been able to reap a $125,000,000-a-year harvest. Never before has New York City had 25,000 members of this unsavory guild, with a total annual income estimated at $25,000,000.

We may smile at the African superstitions expressed in the circular advertisement of a "Dr." C. D. Alexander of Brooklyn, who offers: "Spells of all kinds released and broken. Love-apples in all forms. High John, the Conqueror, Adam and Eve, Black Cats' Ankle Dust, and All Kinds of Highly Appreciated Roots and Herbs. Cash or Credit" and whose supplementary list of wares includes "Bringing-back Powders," designed to coax back a straying wife or husband, "Tying-down Powders," to make the object of one's affections more approachable. Yet let us not make the mistake of concluding that such superstition is restricted to the illiterate of the colored race!

In a large catalog published by a Chicago firm almost every page makes reference to charms and mystical methods for "at-tracting the opposite sex." Sacred Magical Art Talisman No. 18315, for example, called "a talisman for love," is described with these promises: "This talisman is said to be wonderfully efficacious in procuring success in love and affairs of the heart. It is related in an ancient manuscript that the nature of this talisman is to assist in procuring the love of women, to cause men to marry their acknowledged sweethearts, to pacify strife and contentions between those who love one anther, to appease anger and quarrels.' It is sought after by many who believe it helps to cause marriage, to procure love, and to obtain favor from the opposite sex."

The cultivation of superstition in courtship and marriage has found even collegiate endorsement. Dr. Donald Patterson, professor of psychology at Minnesota University, showed that large numbers of students in this school believed in various forms of fortune-telling. Similarly startling results were obtained by Dr. Otis D. Caldwell and Dr. Gerhard E. Lundeen at Columbia University.

Particularly dangerous is the ill-conceived advice of fortune-tellers. John Mulholland, first vice-president of the Society of American Magicians, who conducted a personal six-year survey of fortune-telling through the cities and towns of our country, claims that four out of every ten persons in the United States believe in fortune-telling and that two more out of every ten are willing to believe. He writes this sweeping condemnation: "Fortune-tellers and their kind break up more homes in the United States than any other one cause. People go to such persons to get answers to only two questions — questions about love and money. Fortune-tellers have found that plain matter-of-fact answers do not interest their clients; so they tell them their wife or husband is interested in some other person and thus sow the seeds of jealousy." (New York Times, July 14, 1931.)

That mirror of human activity, the daily press, illustrates the domestic havoc wrought by our neopagan devotion to superstition. The Chicago Tribune of July 14, 1931, contains the following typical item: "A fortune-teller whose black prophecies have driven Mrs. -, twenty-six-year-old mother of two children, to plunge to her death from a ninth-floor window of the Saranac Hotel yesterday was hunted by the police last night. A note in the dead woman's handwriting evinced fear that her seven-year-old son, Harold, would lose his sight and that her husband would desert her." The same paper, under the date of March 8, 1930, reports: "A young Indian woman's love for a white man, seeking to gain its end by employing ancient Cayuga black magic through the latter-day medium of the ouija-board, brought about the murder of Mrs. — (wife of the white man). The ouija-board warned that, unless the white woman' were killed, she would kill the Indian woman, according to letters found by police."

Every visit to the fortune-teller, every purchase of an amulet, every concession to the spirit of superstition, is an insult to God. His injunction is final: "There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord" (Deut: 18:10, 11). In His omnipotence and loving-kindness He has promised His children that He will direct their affairs for their own better interests, so that all things will work together harmoniously, "for good to them that love God" (Rom. 8:28).

Aside from the fundamental Biblical indictment, fortune-telling is a fraud. The protest of the Scriptures: "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you" (Jer. 29:8), and the flat, unequivocal denunciation of Zechariah (chap. 10:2): "For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain," should serve as a sounding bell for continuous caution.

This warning has been emphasized by successive exposés. A few years ago New York newspapers were asked by a group of seers to publish their weather forecasts rather than the Government bulletins. For a month the New York Times printed both. The most favorable count showed that out of thirty-one chances to be right the clairvoyants made only six correct predictions. Now, if these deceivers cannot do more than make bad guesses about the weather, it needs no elaborate argumentation to show that they have no second sense in family affairs.

Similarly we recall the utter inability of the country's foremost "oracles" to foretell the kidnaping and death which brought sorrow to the Lindbergh home. Joseph Dunninger assembled the annual forecast of 145 prognosticators and could find nothing more than a vague remark in two of the forecasts to the effect that "some-thing will happen early in March which will startle the country." One of the augurs even predicted the Lindbergh child's life would be uneventful until it reached the age of twenty. Nor did a single prophet among the legions of American fortune-tellers point to a Bronx garage as the cache for the ransom-money. If tragedies of nation-wide importance cannot be foretold, by what claim can occultism set itself up as a divine science that can solve domestic difficulties?

The tactics employed by fortune-tellers often amount to black-mail. John Mulholland gives this example of their technique: "One group once worked three years to get its 'evidence.' A select girls' school was singled out. Its students were told 'Aunt Beatrice' would invite them to spend the week-end with her and send a liveried chauffeur to the school for them — all for a very nominal fee. The students took advantage of the opportunity, and several visited 'Aunt Beatrice? Three years later, after they had been introduced to society and married, they paid heavily [in blackmail] for their visit to 'Aunt Beatrice.' A fortune-teller claimed to have read their 'indiscretions' in their palms." (New York Evening World, February 7, 1930.)

A protest must also be voiced against the methods of astrology, which has climbed to incredible heights during the last years: Practically all modern resources of publicity have been drafted into its service. Until the Federal Radio Commission intervened in 1931, regular astrological broadcasts were made over nation-wide chains and by independent stations in our large cities. In one year — so it is claimed — 1,300,000 individuals in the radio audience of the Columbia Broadcasting System requested individual horo-scopes. Magazines print flashy advertisements extolling the powers of astrology; newspapers (Fred C. Kelley in The Commentator asserts that at least 250 newspapers contain regular articles on astrol-ogy) daily feature the signs of the zodiac and their significance; a radio digest headlines: "Astrologer Guarantees Matrimony."

Questions of the heart, of home-life, and family relations are the subjects on which astrological advice is most frequently sought. If a dictograph could be hidden in the lavishly equipped office of a popular astrologer and record the questions answered there, the list of inquiries would repeatedly reveal consultation on these subjects: "Does she love me?" "Is he true to me?" "How can I regain his love?" "Where was he last night?" The late Evangeline Adams, "Queen of American astrologers," admitted: "Most of my callers concern themselves with strictly personal problems. 'Have I met the right man?' 'Am I likely to be engaged this year?' 'Am I to be married soon and, if so, when?' "Will my fate be rich or famous?' 'How can I hold my husband, or how am I to get rid of him?' The largest portion of my daily mail also concerns itself with these questions." In her five-and-ten-cent-store publications, still read with morbid avidity, a front-page appeal invites the reader to learn "how to attract love," "how to make a success of marriage," "how to find your right mate," "how to love." Pseudoscientific recourse is taken to the theories of the ancient Chinese, who allegedly selected their marriage partners without seeing them, according to the dictates of the stars and the influence of the planets in life and love.

The astrological imposition insists that "by the same system of charting the stars which foretell great events can the end or dissolution of marriage be foretold and sometimes avoided." No one should marry without horoscopic investigation, readers are told; for "the planetary aspects, unlike a pretty face or manly chest, do not conceal one's tendencies.... The rogue, the rascal, and the criminal are as easily detected as a regular offender's picture in the rogue's gallery." A client is reminded: "You should never marry. Your Neptune in the seventh house has given you an intense desire for marriage, but it has at the same time prevented you [sic] marrying the kind of man with whom you could be happy." Patent bids for bigger, if not better, astrological business are clothed in insinuations like these: "Your husband's stars, or your wife's, or your sweet-heart's, or your child's, or your partner's, or your friend's may be almost as important to your happiness as your own. You can see from reading these pages how valuable it would be to have the same kind of information about your husband or your wife that you now have about yourself. You can't know too much about a husband; can you?"

How disruptive the advice of astrologists proves in actual life is shown by newspaper items like the following:

"San Jose, California: After twenty-eight years of married life, George D. read an astrology book which revealed the fact that he and his wife were born under adverse planets. He requested his wife to file suit for divorce so that he might find a mate that came under a more congenial planet. She did."

The Christian spurns the very suggestion of astrology. To him it is a pernicious denial of the providential guidance of God. In the Old Testament proud Babylonia is tauntingly challenged to escape her doom by resorting to her astrologers, her star-gazers, and monthly prognosticators (Is. 47:13). While star-worship was practiced generally by all nations surrounding Israel, the Scriptures branded it as a heathen fraud, an abomination, and an insult to God. Today, after the advent of our Savior and the assurance of His divine love, those who take recourse to horoscopes for the pledge of a happy home show a lack of intelligence and a refusal to trust in their heavenly Father. In spite of the frequent Biblical quotations craftily interwoven between the claims of astrologers, the anti-christian character of their doctrine appears in their own statements. Read this and draw your own conclusions: "We are just now emerging from what many people call 'the age of saviors,' lasting two thousand years, during which the human race has been led forward by a succession of great men. We are now coming into the aquarian or humanitarian age, where each man is his own savior." (Evangeline Adams's Own Book of Astrology, p. 14.)

Astrological superstition is, it hardly need be explained, an abject fraud, and a base delusion. The alleged prophecies are clever deductions or mere guesses. The Smithsonian Institution in Washington has published the investigations of eminent scientists who declare that "fortunes in general are not predictable.". Dr. Dirk Brouwer of Yale University declares: "Signs of the zodiac and a scattering of the names of planets and astronomical words still impress people more than the recent new developments in the field of relativity. Astronomers today are practical-minded. They know that for the most part these so-called astrological tables are inaccurate. Even if the tables were correct, there never is, and never has been, any evidence to show that there is a connection between phenomena in the heavens and the lives of men." (New York Times, August 6, 1931.)

The methods employed by astrologers are typical both of the deceit and danger inherent in this soothsaying. An ex-secretary of a celebrated New York astrologer, conveniently called Madame Zamos, brings a devastating exposé of her employer's methods in the Ladies Home Journal of August, 1933. The "madame astrologer" maintained an intelligence corps, employed private detectives (through an attorney's office in order to veil the purpose for which the information was sought) and an office force of twenty-five girls, who were granted a bonus above the wage scale to insure the discretion of sealed lips. With the help of this formidable espionage staff every fragment of incidental gossip, shrewdly ferreted from innocent social contacts, became grist for the astrological mill. For instance, in the foyer of a theater Madame Zamos happened to meet a young woman who had previously consulted her in a love affair and who was now secretary to a prominent metropolitan lawyer. In an imprudent outburst of confidence this young woman pointed to a Mrs. Winston on the other side of the foyer, the daughter of a wealthy New Yorker, and indiscreetly confided to Madame Zamos that Mr. Winston had consulted her employer, the attorney, regarding a divorce in which Mrs. Winston refused to acquiesce because of the desire to preserve her home and avoid newspaper notoriety and social scandal. Next morning Madame's sleuths feverishly set to work in the attempt to discover possible points of contact with wealthy Mrs. Winston. It was soon learned that Mrs. Winston was a dog-fancier, interested particularly in schnauzers. With the craftiness of war-time secret service, Madame directed one of her operators to secure a schnauzer and to exercise it in the same park in which Mrs. Winston took her daily promenade. A meeting of the two schnauzer owners was inevitable, and further rendezvous naturally followed. Gradually snatches of the conversation drifted to the occult; and when soon after Mrs. Winston paid the expected visit to Madame Zamos, she was astounded to hear the tragedy of her married life revealed and her antipathy to divorce and its publicity disclosed. Of course, the "advice" of the well-dressed, perfumed astrological celebrity was divorce. Madame Zamos never hesitated to prescribe divorce when a restless husband or a dissatisfied wife found the marriage bond irksome.

Reviewing her connection with this astrological establishment, the ex-secretary now confesses that the "mystic" madame had no prophetic power, that the only facts she knew were those gleaned by the keyhole tactics of her private snoopers, that newcomers were never given an appointment until three weeks after sufficient data were received in the astrologer's office to make the interview successful. With a very practical appeal to reason, the ex-secretary now believes that, if Madame Zamos knew what would happen tomorrow or next week or next year, she would find more wealth in a stock-broker's office than in her luxurious apartment. But, the ex-secretary concludes, Madame and her ilk know nothing more of the future than we know ourselves.

The parade of superstition marches on in long columns and with arrogant pomp. Here is a warning voiced by a palmist, one of the large guild which has revived the claim that marital destiny is etched in the lines of the hands: "A young man or girl should never contemplate matrimony without a real study and understanding of each other's hands. It isn't necessary that they be alike or even similar, but it is most imperative that they dovetail. There must not be warfare between their head lines and their heart lines, those two important long lines that run crossways across the middle of the hand."

Those who permit such claims to convince them that "there must be something in palmistry" should take I.Q. tests to learn their real mental age. Anatomists have proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the lines of the hand are of purely physical origin, entirely destitute of any psychic or predictive association. There would at least be the asset of originality if some wide-awake mystic would introduce pedoscopy, the reading of the sole of the foot. Few besides the Chinese seem to have hit upon this mode of prophecy, and foot-reading is at least relatively modern, while palmistry has been tried and rejected even in the dim and distant centuries.

As the advice of all soothsayers, the counsel which even the reputedly best palmists offer is often evil. Beckwith Kirk, internationally known as "one of the world's most famous palmists," inadvertently confesses the way in which this fraud may banish all home happiness. In an interview in Collier's he confides: "Recently a woman who is socially prominent came to me. She had already taken steps toward divorcing her husband, but she said she was still madly in love with him and was uncertain as to whether she had acted wisely. I looked at her hands. The sign of divorce appeared in both of them. It was inevitable.

"Anything which is shown by signs in both hands cannot be averted. In the left hand an idea or suggestion arises. In the right hand it is carried out.

""You will have to go through with it,' I said. "You will have to learn your lesson, to steel yourself to sorrow. It is going to be hard for you indeed, and you will never quite suppress your love for your husband; but it is the only way?"

While the Church fights its battle to uphold the sanctity of marriage and insists upon its lifelong and indissoluble nature, these professional liars are being paid exorbitant prices for killing love and promoting divorce.

The fraud of palmistry is evident. Kirk, who did not hesitate to help alienate a wife's affections from her husband, is so shocked by the extortions of some fellow-palmists that he is driven to protest: "Now, the fact that a palmist is a professional doesn't mean that it is safe to consult him. You cannot be too careful in choosing a reputable palmist. The story in your hand is an open book to the palmist, and sometimes unscrupulous ones 'cash in' on the knowledge so revealed to them. We had a case in England not long ago where a married woman of some social standing consulted a palmist who read in her palms the story of a youthful indiscretion. At first she denied it, but subsequently confessed. For years he extorted money from her by threatening to reveal the facts to her husband; but finally, when she became desperate and could pay no more, the woman told her husband, and the blackmailer was brought to justice."

These near-tragedies might be laughed off if it were not for the ugly influences on home-life that all merchants of mystery, numerologists, as well as tea-leaf readers, crystal-ball gazers, dream-interpreters, telepathy amateurs, graphologists, and other members of this unsavory guild have exerted. Their efforts have planted false obsessions in the hearts of unnumbered credulous dupes and wrecked thousands of happy homes.

In the nineteenth chapter of Acts we read that a mighty conversion followed the convincing demonstration of the Gospel's power in Ephesus. The fruits of the new faith showed themselves when "many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men; and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver," the largest detailed sum mentioned in New Testament history.

We can find a vital lesson for modern Christian society in this incident. Trust in God, which the Gospel of Jesus Christ has given us, definitely rules out every compromise with any form of superstition. Once our hearts have been given to Christ, who has pledged: "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee" (Heb. 13:5), once our lives have been put under His leadership, all recourse to idolatry is ruled out. Even a semitolerant attitude of amused interest in superstitious practices has been known to produce shocking complications. The warning of the Church is inflexible and uncompromising: Shun every approach to these pseudo-occult frauds!

Let us light a fire to consume all the magazines and books on fortune-telling, all the popularized games and devices of forecast-ing, all the dream books, the "Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses," the amulets and charms, the rabbits' feet, the good-luck rings, and the other symbols of superstition which may have found their way into many homes with or without parental knowledge. Let husbands or wives take the two or three hours required by a consultation with these fraudulent doctors of domestic ills and spend that time in fervent prayer! Let us take the money, offered half jestingly to Gipsy palmists, Hindu crystal-gazers, "professors" of astrology, in carnivals, county fairs, and resorts of commercialized recreation and use these funds for the support of any well-conceived measures that would place these impostors where they should be — either in our penal institutions or preferably beyond the bounds of the country.

### EDUCATIONAL COUNSEL

During recent years, a growing number of educators has held that one of the most beneficial and stabilizing influences in the solution particularly of sex problems must be the candid counsel of educational guidance. In communities like Bronxville and Scarsdale, New York, sex education is taught in the primary schools.

In evaluating these experiments, it may be said, first of all, that the Church is not opposed to enlightenment on these personal questions. If an understanding of general physiology is desirable for bodily well-being, then it is equally evident that intelligence and class discussion should help banish misunderstanding regarding God's gift of human love and its functions. Wilful blindness and utter ignorance never serve any good purpose. With the lips of many parents sealed on these vital matters, young people frequently glean their information on sex from perverted sources, so that their first attitudes are misshapen.

Maryland young people gave the following answers, among others, in Youth Tell Their Story (p. 42) to questions regarding the source of their "sex education":

"I got it out in the street."

"Just from different talk around. My mother never would tell me anything."

"I've had a car since I was sixteen, so you know what that is."

"From the gang I hang around with."

"In the gutter, where everybody else gets theirs."

"I learned by experience."

"On the street corner."

"I got an earful here and an earful there."

"My mother is one of those old-timers who believe in letting you find things out for yourself."

"When I was thirteen, mother told me everything about it."

On the other hand, however, the wave of enthusiasm for the dissemination of the facts of life among our grammar-school children and the zeal with which this is promoted entail highly objectionable features. The grammar-school is clearly not the proper place for this material, for it is far beyond the years of most children, and its recital in the classroom will often awaken latent curiosity and provoke morbid inquiry. The ensuing familiarity may, more than anything else, lead to a contempt of the truth and stimulate blasé discussion.

Besides, education in itself is never a panacea. The late Dr. R. C. Cabot, professor of medicine and social ethics at Harvard University, declares: "It isn't knowledge that keeps people 'straight'; if it did, doctors and nurses would be the most exemplary people in the world, — and we know they are not. The teaching of sex hygiene in the public schools is not helpful to the youth of the land, in my estimation. In the first place, it centralizes the attention and the thought and the imagination on a thing that we do not want the thought centralized upon; hence its teaching is contradictory. Children develop along sex lines at widely divergent ages. What one child is ready for in the way of instruction the next one is not ready for, and to force knowledge upon a child who is not ready for it is a serious thing. Such knowledge should be imparted to individuals and not to groups."

More than information is required. Floyd Allport, psychologist, admits: "One important caution must be borne in mind. The mere informing of the child in sexual matters, if not combined with the formation of attitudes, principles, and habits proper to persons possessing such knowledge, is as likely to produce harmful as it is beneficial results. The mere desire to tell the child the truth' is in itself no adequate justification for imparting the physiological facts. The aim should be not merely sex enlighten-ment, but sex training." (Quoted in Marriage, by Bakewell Morrison, S. J.)

Speaking to Boston University students, Karl de Schweinitz, Pennsylvania School of Social Work, recently conceded: "Our grandparents acted on the theory that the less said about sex, the better. We seem to be guided by the principle that it cannot be talked about too much. There is at the outset the belief that information is itself a solution." He insisted that vastly more effective than knowledge is "the observation by the child of a satisfactory home-life; the love and affection of the parents for each other and for their children and the feeling of security this gives to the children. Those emotional elements in family life are more vital than facts and have an infinitely greater influence upon the lives of children."

With this pronounced increase in the study of physiology and the understanding of the body we could expect that juvenile delinquency would be drastically checked. The absolute antithesis confronting us shows that education alone can never meet the high hopes placed in its illuminative power. It must be supplemented by something else.

That something else is the fear of God. Unless young people realize in a very personal way that sex in itself is a holy bestowal of our heavenly Father and that sin has ineffaceably marred the attitude of the entire human race towards its beauties, its privileges, and its blessings, they cannot understand that the prime requirements for moral strengthening are the forgiveness and the removal of sin and the checking of animal desires. Jesus says: "Without Me ye can do nothing," and the sex education which eliminates Christ and His Scriptures may often produce nothing more than a mental assimilation of physiological data. It is only with God's Word as a divine spectrum that the various colorings of these questions can be carefully distinguished and properly evaluated. Because modern instruction has little appreciation for the soul-molding influence of Christianity, sex education, as commonly understood, has sometimes defeated the ends for which it is instituted.

By what process, then, is this vital information to be imparted? With the assurance that the average boy or girl at adolescence has a vague and usually incorrect understanding of some major facts, Christian parents must give their own children an accurate outline of the basic truths. It is entirely unnecessary to indulge in intricacies and much detail or resort to diagrams and illustrations. Life itself will teach many of these lessons. When children who are approaching adolescence begin to ask, as they inevitably do, repeated questions as to the origin of life, they should not be side-tracked with hush or evasion and least of all with mythological absurdities that no child of that age believes.

At the same time children must be warned directly against the attraction of sin and the abuses of God's gifts. They should be told that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and they should be reminded of the commandment of purity. How modern parents can complacently see their children thrown into a world of topsy-turvy morals — without a home basis for guidance — is one of the too frequent mysteries even in church circles. Parental direction is part of the moral duty which all fathers and mothers share; but it is a spiritual obligation of Christians that parents who bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord extend the instruction to include the reverent guidance in those questions where ignorance or perversion often gives soul-destroying answers. Let fathers counsel their sons, mothers their daughters, and know that the advice thus given may be of far-reaching consequence.

If parents are incapable of imparting this information or unwilling to do so, the services of a Christian physician may be employed. His objective presentation will certainly act as a corrective to false ideas or harmful exaggerations, particularly when appropriate emphasis is laid upon the sins of impurity and their punishment as well as upon the helpful spiritual forces. Recourse may also be taken to some of the few and good books which have been issued by Christian writers. Omitting technical books, we recommend to our readers volumes like the Ought to Know books, reverently conceived and carefully written by Sylvanus Stall, D. D. This series embraces four volumes for men and as many for women, each emphasizing the purity problems of the four ages: boyhood, young manhood, early marriage, and late marriage. Particularly helpful because of its brevity and practical presentation is Why was I Not Told? by E. W. Marquardt, M. D., a Christian physician of wide experience. The publishers of the present volume will be glad to answer inquiries concerning this and other books.

In postmarital difficulties, family troubles, and domestic misunderstandings the good offices of the pastor will be the most helpful agency for reestablishing mutual understanding. Young couples who regard their pastor as old-fashioned, ultra-conservative, and austere often refuse to give him the opportunity of showing the warmth of human sympathy and the understanding friendliness which are his. To those who declare that they simply cannot discuss their home affairs with their spiritual advisers let it be said that perhaps the fault is theirs. It may be that behind this reluctance is a disquieted conscience, agitated by the acute realization that their pastor may feel constrained to raise his voice in warning. Perhaps there is a wholly unwarranted fear that the busy minister is altogether too preoccupied to listen to their individual problems. Or perhaps this reticence is due to an unfortunate feeling of distance, aggravated in some large congregations by the fact that to all intents and purposes the pastor and some of his young people are almost strangers.

Whatever may account for this cleft, every newly founded Christian home should gratefully accept the spiritual guidance of the pastor and gladly consult him in any difficulty requiring his counsel. This impartial guidance will help to lead many through the maze of modern complexities, while wilful spurning of these friendly offices and reliance on crafty and commercial counselors may lead to the quicksands.

Some pastors are particularly zealous in maintaining their connections with those whom they have started in married life. A clergyman who writes at least one letter every year to every couple he has married conducts a reunion service to which the brides and bridegrooms he has united are especially invited. On this occasion the sermon deals with the Christian home, and a copy is mailed to those couples who are unable to attend. He seems unusually successful in serving as a counselor to these families; for his report summarizes: "I have married in the course of the last fourteen years 722 couples. Half of these had only the most superficial contact with me before the wedding. The average divorce rate would have given my group a total of 123 broken homes. Up to date fewer than a dozen of these homes have been shattered by dissensions, and fewer than half a dozen of them have been ruined by divorce. And the experience has been one of the most rewarding things in my life." (Bernard C. Clausen, "An Adventure in Defeating Divorce," Journal of Social Hygiene, March, 1934.)
