## 5.7 THOSE WHO WAIT - AND WONDER

All things work together for good to them that love God - Rom. 8:28

For the first time in twenty-one years the number of marriages in the United States fell below the million mark when in 1932 a new matrimonial low was reached at 981,759 marriages. Since 1887, according to Miss Alice Hagan, keeper of the marriage and divorce statistics in Washington, the rate has never been less than 8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants. But starting with 1929, as a consequence of economic upheaval, a steady decrease has been recorded. In that year the rate was 10.14; in 1930, 9.15; in 1931, 8.54; in 1932, 7.87. Only ten of the forty-eight States in the Union, each bordering on States with new and stricter marriage laws, showed even a slight increase.

In my own Church the number of marriages suffered a proportionate 25-per-cent reduction in the period from 1905 to 1933. In 1905 the number of marriages was 2 per cent plus of the number of communicants. In 1933, however, the number of marriages was 1.05 per cent of the number of communicants.

In the years since 1932 the rise in the number of marriages has been so rapid that not even economic improvement offers adequate explanation. In 1935 1,327,000 marriages were solemnized in our country, an increase of more than a third of a million marriages over the 1932 figure.

Despite the continued rise of matrimonial ratios the United States has more unattached young people of marriageable age today than ever before. A survey of the young men and women within the circles of my correspondence reveals many girls with positions of importance in the business world who would gladly exchange their vocational opportunities for a happy home, but who are without definite matrimonial prospects: unnumbered college women and school-teachers, ready to admit that "the right man" might be a farmer, a bank clerk, a shopkeeper, or an underpaid preacher, yet who seem unnoticed by the host of eligible males; young men — and their number is larger than the cynical-minded concede — who are eager for a happy marriage, yet, having only a few acquaintances among the fair sex, seem unable to make progress on the path to the altar. We see, in short, vast numbers of potential husbands and fathers, wives and mothers, splendid Christian young folk, who yearn for marriage but apparently in vain. And these well-balanced, head-in-the-air young men and women, earnestly praying to their God for true, Christian helpmates, yet passing one milestone after another as the twenties give way to the thirties without receiving an answer to their appeal, — this army of the unmarried, yet marriageable submits one of the most serious of all our practical problems.

### THE PROBLEM STATED

It has been my repeated experience when speaking to youth groups throughout the country on questions of hearth and home that young women — not the self-asserting, querulous type, but whole-hearted, salt-of-the-earth girls— have presented a frequent, yet highly perplexing angle of this problem. They frankly say in effect: "The Church tells us that marriage is an institution of God, given for the benefit of His children. We agree fully. The Church further tells us that the ideal marriage, and the union which has the promise of divine blessing, is the life companionship of two sincere Christians. Once again we agree. But within this circle of our choice we find the young men often quite disinterested or without those qualities which we want in prospective husbands."

Specifically this problem is aired in an open letter published by the Chicago Tribune, May 14, 1933, — a self-portrait by a forgotten girl:

"I am an office-worker, twenty-four. Up till now I have never had a beau. I get so despondent sometimes hearing the girls tell about the good times they have had on dates. I see them being taken to lunch, to dinner. I hear of their getting flowers, nice little gifts, attentions of all kinds.

"On looking over my life, I cannot seem to lay a finger on the trouble. I guess I must have been born this way. I am no beauty; but when I look around at some of the girls being escorted here and there, I can't fairly charge my misfortune to my ap-pearance. I'm average; neither beautiful nor ugly but presentable enough.

"I think when I was born, it was without that certain spark of what might be called glamor, or whatever it is, that attracts men to girls and makes them want to see them after office hours. I'm not an old-fashioned girl, although it looks as if I'll be an old maid. .

"The girls in the office seem to like me. They like to lunch with me. I am always included in their after-office outings. I pride myself on the fact that I am considered a good sport in the office by both girls and men. I can take a lot of fun without being touchy.

"The whole pain lies in the fact that I do not appeal to men in the feminine way. They would never think of buying me flowers, although nothing I can think of would give me more joy than to be the recipient of even one small rosebud. (Now I'm giving away the sentimental side of my nature.) It hurts me when I am passed up and left decorating the walls. I grieve in secret about this. I would do anything within my power to change. But I don't know what to do.

"I get along fine in my work. No deficiency in gray matter there, if I can believe what I hear. But I wonder sometimes if I am not a little below normal in this other respect. Sometimes it seems as though every other girl in the world has an escort but me, and it's awfully hard medicine to take. Only a girl who has been or is a wall-flower can know what it all means.... Anne Waters."

The reason for situations like this is not to be found in the theory that there are more women in our country than men. Contrary to popular opinion the wisdom and power of God are strikingly illustrated in the generally equal-number ratio of sexes. Actually our country has more males than females. The statistics tabulated in the 1930 census show 37,056,757 men over twenty-one years in the United States with 35,886,867 women in the same category. Only in the urban population do the women above twenty-one outnumber the men: 22,149,447 to 21,747,237. In eleven States: New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Con-necticut, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, the women have a slight majority, but in the other thirty-seven the men enjoy a numerical edge.

Nor is this surplus of unmarried women to be ascribed solely to the disturbed economic order. The consequence of any nationwide financial upheaval, of course, is the postponement of marriage. Yet even our money difficulties cannot completely account for the number of these unmarried young women.

Finances sometimes do play a disconcerting role, however, notably when the young woman is economically independent. A girl with a position commanding a generous salary may learn to her dismay that her income has discouraged the attention of a young man who, climbing on the lower rungs of business success, earns perhaps only half as much as she does. One finds many courageous marriages in which this barrier has been swept aside by strong love; but it is evident that high salaries have helped to swell the number of unmarried women.

A further factor in the enlargement of bachelors' and spinsters' ranks is the mistaken policy which insists upon matrimonial standards attainable only in the rarest instances. This attitude is often a consequence of certain trends in higher education. Some time ago Dr. Katherine Bement Davis in Harper's Magazine discussed the prevalence of spinsterhood among educated women. Basing her findings on ten years' activity as general secretary of the New York Bureau of Social Hygiene, supplemented by statements of 1,200 college women, she summarized: Less than 1 per cent of these college women preferred freedom to marriage; yet 28 per cent made the explanation, "Never met the right man." But lack of social opportunities to meet men has been the lot of only few. Preoccupied with cultural studies, their mind has been weaned from the matter-of-fact concerns of daily existence. Consciously or unconsciously they have neglected some of life's commonplaces and essentials. They have acquired an academic disdain for the routine of domestic duty. Perhaps without their knowledge and against their intention they have enshrouded themselves with a nimbus of self-confidence, which in turn provokes an inferiority complex in would-be suitors. Many young men maintain their very respectful distance from the college women coated with the bright armor of intellectual superiority.

Deep below the cold compilation of facts in American Women (second edition, 1937-38) lies a pointed lesson: Only 43 per cent of the 7,851 women, America's feminine leaders, are married, although only 89 of the 7,851 are under thirty. The path to feminine distinction in the majority of cases is not the path to the altar.

W. J. Ballinger, formerly professor of economics at Smith College and since 1937 economic adviser of the Federal Trades Com-mission, speaks very emphatically on this subject (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, May 9, 1933): "Education for women in America is a tragedy. That tragedy is twofold. In the first place, so many of our educated women are being deprived of an opportunity to marry. This is due to the antimarriage nature of the educational process through which they pass. In the second place, our women's colleges, by their failure to train women for marriage, have done endless harm. They have by their intellectual prestige held back in our educational system any attempt to recognize that a training for marriage should be an important goal in our civilization... Taking the college graduate thirteen years out of college, I find that one college claims that 65 per cent of its graduates are married This was the highest record I could find. Yet for women of the nation as a whole, that is, women of the comparable age of thirty-four, I find that nearly 85 per cent are married. It is perfectly clear that our college graduates do not marry as often as their uncollegiate sisters."

One of the reasons the matrimonial rate is not higher among our school-teachers is unquestionably the fact that their occupational activities involve restrictions not imposed on many other women. The stenographer, the factory worker, the saleswoman, usually meet people and are enabled to form wider circles of friendship than those enjoyed by the school-teacher despite her intellectual equipment.

Some girls have themselves to blame. They think stiff formality is a virtue and often become untrue to themselves. They hide an honest, open, friendly attitude beneath the mask of distance and austerity, only to find that their attempt to maintain dignity and poise has been misinterpreted as forbidding aloofness.

### NO MARRIAGE MARKETS!

This problem of meeting eligible suitors is by no means new, and custom has endeavored to cope with it in many interesting ways. The Bosnians, for instance, maintain a marriage market at Sarajevo, where Archduke Francis Ferdinand was murdered in the prelude to the war, in 1914. On Easter Monday morning candidates for domestic bliss stream into that city from the surrounding country-side. With pronounced self-consciousness the girls, dressed in their finest costumes and displaying their dowry in golden coin jewelry, stroll through the streets of the bazaar. Bosnian swains look on as the marriage parade passes and later, after appropriate choice is made, settle the marriage on a cash basis.

Such exhibitions are generally ruled out by our Western conventions. The nearest survival is found in France, where November 25 is dedicated to St. Catherine. In the hagiology of the Roman Church, Catherine of Alexandria was sainted because she suffered martyrdom in the third century. The custom of addressing a prayer to her, particularly in time of trouble, developed because tradition said it was she who appeared to Joan of Are and encouraged the Maid of Orleans in her darkest hours. Probably the fact that she never married was due to her unapproachable demands. As a schoolgirl she insisted that her future husband be of noble birth, a king in his own right, attractive enough to delight the angels, and of a complacent, all-forgiving nature. Gradually unmarried young women began to associate her with their own problems of marriage, and at an early date she became patron saint of the unwed. On St. Catherine's Day single young women have the traditional right of donning a St. Catherine's bonnet and proposing marriage to any man they meet. The Catherinettes sweep down along the boulevards in the annual husband hunt, and for one day, or rather one evening, Paris is theirs. We are assured that this custom is not without tangible success in the promotion of marriage. In a recent year, the newspapers report, the festival led to a marriage increase of 10 per cent in the following December.

On St. Catherine's Day in England unmarried young women gather in old Milton Abbey to ask:

A husband, St. Catherine;
A handsome one, St. Catherine;
A rich one, St. Catherine;
A nice one, St. Catherine;
And soon, St. Catherine.

The idea behind St. Catherine's Day has long been practiced at least in one section of Asia. Among the most progressive and prosperous of Mother India's 350,000,000 children, travelers tell us, are the inhabitants of the kingdom of Travancore. Strange to say, this is one district of India in which women are supreme; for while in some places the Hindu wife is so completely subjected to her husband that she is not supposed to eat at the same table with him or even look him full in the face, in this province matriarchy, the rule of women, has survived to a most remarkable degree. Significantly the Travancore woman selects her own husband.

Sociologists throughout the Western world are wondering whether this idea could not be introduced successfully in the Occident, particularly in view of the increasing number of unmarried young people. German maidens, weary of the indirect methods, organized a campaign for the establishment of "leap week," seven days each year during which it shall be their privilege to propose marriage.

A group of professional entertainers in New York presented to Mayor La Guardia a petition for a St. Catherine's Day in New York, an innovation, it was claimed, which would relieve the plight of lonely women in that city. In their address to the mayor they declared: "We believe that there are many fine young women in New York compelled to forego male companionship through circumstances beyond their control. In their behalf do we petition you to make it possible for these persons to meet and know promising young men under conditions that are wholesome and with the approval of the general public." This extension of the leap-year privilege has received strenuous endorsement.

A Chelsea, Massachusetts, woman recently went to Washington to request a national bachelor-maiden day and to tell some of the legislators: "We should honor those men and women who through righteous obligations and love of service have sacrificed the pleasures of parenthood but have shared equally in its problems and responsi-bilities." As the beneficiaries of this proposal all unmarried men and women in the nation (of marriageable age) are grouped in these classifications: Uncles and aunts; sisters and brothers; nephews and nieces; daughters and sons; various assorted cousins. It has been suggested that June 27 be set aside annually for this day.

The noted naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, a contemporary of Darwin, argued that things will not be right in the family until the woman does the choosing. Dr. Frederick Lent, president of Elmira College, New York, the oldest college for women in the United States, challenged: "Why should a woman have to wait until some man asks her to marry him? Why should she not have the right to look for a good husband the same as a man has to look for a good wife?" Others suggest an aggressive policy. Miss Helen Gwynne, retiring president of the Y. W. C. A.'s national industrial assembly, in her valedictory advised working-girls to be flashy, to wear gaudy clothes, as an aid to matrimonial ends.

We recall a lesson of warning from the ancient art of fishing. Some of the largest and wariest trout often are brought in by gray, drab flies, while a red flannel rag will almost always attract a bull-frog. The girl who is indiscriminate in her determination "to get her man" by corralling a large retinue of admirers and who makes undisguised advances may momentarily bask supreme in the spotlight of popularity; but when the more serious issues of life present themselves and the paramount question of finding a companion for the weal and woe of an entire career demands an answer, this self-assertiveness definitely works to her disadvantage. Most of us feel an instinctive agreement with the opinion of Fanny Heaslip Lea, popular author, who declares: "I cannot believe that women would ever welcome the initiative in the matter of marriage proposal. Foolish the woman, foolish beyond description, who wants to exchange her privilege of being courted for the right to court! She forgets that, if woman proposes, man will, without scruple, be able to refuse. The women whom men want they will always lay siege to; the women whom men do not want men will not have at the point of a gun. Man does not worship the too readily accessible."

### MAIL-ORDER MARRIAGES

We are not so far advanced that warnings against these crudities are superfluous; for a marriage mart much larger than the alleged Babylonian bride market of which the Greek historian Herodotus tells is being conducted today in our own country. Professional marriage managers publish a string of periodicals chiefly to advertise the attractions of marriage-minded women; and it has been estimated that no fewer than 100,000 clients are listed in the various marriage bureaus. These advertisements are not clothed with the attempt at delicate subtlety printed in a Philippine newspaper:

"Being aware that it is indelicate to advertise for a hus-band, I refrain from doing so; but if any gentleman should be inclined to advertise for a wife, I will answer the advertisement without delay. Am young, domesticated, and rather good-looking."

Nor are they as objective as these typical advertisements taken from the largest daily newspaper of South India:

"Wanted, young Brahmin graduate, non-Sankriti Gotra, to marry beautiful, accomplished Brahacharanam girl, 18. Facilities offered for advancement in life."

"Wanted for a fair and beautiful Madhva bridegroom, aged 24, holding independent position, a fair and respectful bride. A dowry required. Apply with horoscope."

"Inquiry from influential circles regarding marriage of a Vaishnavite girl (14) of distinguished parents is invited. Good personality and academical equipment to start well in life must meet with encouraging response."

"Wanted, a Smartha Vadama Brahmin bridegroom, aged 20 to 25, of respectable family, educated and well settled in life, for a fair, well-accomplished girl aged 14 of the same sect. No objection to widowers below 30 in decent position, with no encumbrances. No Varaaskshina. Apply with horoscope and full particulars."

Our marriage advertisements are boldly printed under headlines like this:

### "WON'T YOU WRITE A LONELY MAIDEN?"

"The ladies whose photos and descriptions appear herein have registered with us for the purpose of receiving letters from gentlemen and becoming married. One dollar pays for the names and addresses of all lady advertisers in this issue. After you receive their names, you can make your own selections, writing to as many as you choose. Many of these ladies are very lonely and are anxiously waiting to hear from some gentleman who is sincere. By securing their names and addresses at once, you may have the first chance of corresponding, exchanging photos, calling on them, etc. We cater only to ladies of wealth and refinement, and our service gives you the opportunity of a rich marriage."

Under picture purporting to exhibit the charm of the eligibles, the reader meets brazen bids for marriage, which outrage every element of propriety.

Entirely apart from the repulsiveness of such advertising is the long list of serious objections to the procedures of these marriage markets. Experience has proved that their advertisements are often wilful misrepresentations and deceptions. The annals of criminology have recently associated some atrocious murders with such matrimonial correspondence; and the soul-suffering provoked by professional marriage managers (some of whom draw $9,000 a year according to the confession of the director of the Widows' and Widowers' Club in Brooklyn, New York) completely overclouds any shadow of happiness which may be experienced by two lives brought together through this outrage against common decency.

Young people who feel tempted to enter into one of these correspondences simply "for the fun of it" should take to heart the words of the Evangelist T. Dewitt Talmage: "Avoid all proposed alliances through newspaper advertisements. Many women, just for fun, have answered such advertisements and have been led step by step to catastrophe infinite.... Do you answer them just for fun? I will tell you a safer and healthier fun. Thrust your hand through the cage and stroke the back of a cobra from the East Indies. Put your hand into the mouth of a Nubian lion to see if it will bite. Take a glassful of Paris green mixed with some delightful henbane. These are a safer and healthier fun than answering newspaper advertisements for a husband or wife."

Evidently the postal authorities of the United States share this opinion. The Post Office Department has issued a statement disavowing any responsibility for the unhappy consequences of mail courtship. A section of this statement warns: "In the legal opinion of the Post Office Department almost daily letters are received from deserted brides, distraught and frantic in their misery, asking for governmental assistance in locating runaway husbands and pleading for aid in prosecuting them. In some instances these wives blame the postal service for their marital woes, demanding redress and claiming that, as they were wooed entirely through the mails, the Post Office Department is directly responsible. An excerpt from one of these letters, typical of all the others, reads like this: "I want to know whether I can start suit against my husband. We married through a correspondence club advertised in the newspapers, and he sent me money by a post-office money-order to come and marry him. He also courted me by mail. After the wedding he failed to support me and take care of me and finally left me altogether. I want to know whether I can do anything through the Post Office Department, as our business, such as arranging for marriage details, was transacted entirely by mail.'" (Release of July 31, 1922.)

### CANDID ADVICE

The candid counsel that a practical, Christian interpretation of life extends to those who wait and wonder must be this: Do not be guilty of the distasteful mistake of making yourself obvious or of thinking that popularity comes with boisterous self-assertiveness and a parade of your attractions! Do not make the opposite mistake of absenting yourself from those places and pastimes where young men or young women of desirable eligibility can find you! Go places, do things, meet people!

Not long ago a lonely person in Wisconsin wrote the Milwaukee Journal to ascertain where and how it would be possible to become acquainted with young people. An alert girl wrote in a quick reply, inviting her to attend her church and to become acquainted with the work of the Walther League, the young people's society in her congregation. Similar advice, if persistently followed, would extricate many young people from self-imposed isolation and afford the opportunity of finding desirable friends under the best sur-roundings. If the young people's societies of the Church did nothing more than offer each member occasion to mingle with a fine class of responsible young people, this contribution alone would justify their existence.

### ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE UNMARRIED

Nor must we lose sight of the fact that, while marriage itself is a magnificent gift of God's grace, it is not indispensable for happiness. Notables in every walk of life have remained unmarried. A casual perusal of the famous bachelors of history recalls Washington Irving, author and diplomat, beloved at home and abroad; Charles Lamb, who remained single partly because of the fear of hereditary insanity, but whose essays of geniality and charm are treasured by the English-speaking world; John Keats, whose poetry has first place among the romanticists, but who had to forego marriage with Fanny Brawne because of his consumptive condition; James Buchanan, who attained to the highest office within the bestowal of our country, being our nation's only bachelor President; Leonardo Da Vinci, the great painter and scientist; Michelangelo, the Titan genius in marble, tempera, and stone; Sir Joshua Reyn-olds, portrait painter, who ranks with Gainsborough among the great British masters; William Pitt, Prime Minister of England at twenty-four, who once loved a girl but lost her and then lived with only one consuming desire for the rest of his life — the prosperity of Great Britain. In the musical world alone we have these striking figures: Johannes Brahms, whose life's motto was Frei, aber froh ("Unmarried but happy") and who immortalized the initial letters of his motto in the F-A'.F theme of his Third Symphony; Franz Schubert, the greatest song-writer in the musical world; Handel, who nearly married twice and who refused the position as organist and successor of Buxtehude when told that his appointment demanded that he marry Buxtehude's daughter. In the present decade we are reminded of the late Sir Thomas Lipton, Irish tea merchant and yachting sportsman, who was spurned by a Scottish lassie.

Another survey of famous personages among unmarrid women lists Charlotte and Emily Bronte, English novelists; Emily Dickin-son, one of America's great poets; the renowned Florence Nightin-gale; and the late Jane Addams of Hull House fame.

Young people with a Christ-directed perspective of life will realize that the attainment of the best in life can be reached entirely apart from marriage. Christians who live on year after year without marital prospects should strive for the faith which enables them to come before their heavenly Father with the declara-tion: "Thou doest 'all things well'" (Mark 7:37). They should voice their prayers to Him who directs the destinies of His children and under whose guidance two hearts are finally united. They should trust in His divine wisdom and believe His pledged assurance that, whether married or unmarried, "all things work together for good to them that love God" (Rom. 8:28). They should accept the full joy of their consecrated, Christ-centered lives.
