## PIVOTAL PARENTS

Honor thy father and thy mother - Ex. 20:12

That grim truth is stranger than fiction was revealed by a harrowing tragedy in the remote Polish village of Zagajniki. There a plot regarded as preposterous in the dramatization of Henry Rostworowski, Polish author, was enacted by real flesh-and-blood characters. Andrew Cygan, the leading figure in this true-story drama, was one of the immigrant army who by hard work and thrift had found moderate success on the shores of golden America. After eighteen years of persistent plodding he decided to take a holiday and pay his aged parents in Zagajniki a surprise visit. About midnight, according to the Associated Press dispatch (February 20, 1931), which retells the story of the villagers, he knocked at the door of the parental cottage and was admitted without being identified, because the only light in the room, the feeble flame on the smoldering hearth, was too faint for the parents to recognize the matured features of their son. For some whim Andrew decided to pose as a stranger and amused the old folks by reciting the golden wonders of the New World. His bulging wallet apparently provoked an exchange of understanding glances between the old man and his wife; and at an unexpected moment the father seized an ax and brought it down on the stranger's skull. The next morning intruding neighbors found the father moaning over the corpse and clutching at official papers revealing his son's identity. The mother was insane.

A similar story, also emanating from the Associated Press, was carried in American newspapers during January, 1935, having been cabled from Gravisa, Yugoslavia. While skeptics may doubt the details in these accounts of "the native's return" motif, as the stories featuring this theme are called, the hideousness of parental murder is not unknown even in our own country. A startling document is the death-note of a distracted mother who placed her three children in bed, gave them sleeping-powders, turned on the gas, and went into an adjoining room to pen this confession of parental neglect before she returned to die with her children in the gas-filled chamber:

"I, —, do here set forth these facts: If I had done my duty, my simple every-day duty, as has my husband, —, we would now be a happy family. He was too good, letting me do as I liked. I slept and read and neglected the homely, every-day duties until I realized my children had not been trained properly. My heart broke; the fear of God came upon me, and I saw myself a lost soul in a broken body. I cannot let my children grow up in a world like this.

"Had I kept active in good work in home, church, and school, my life would have been spent, used, instead of lost. I am a disgrace to my kinsfolk, my family, my university where I studied, my friends, my church, my most courteous and considerate husband, and to humanity at large.

"Why, why, couldn't I have done my simple duty in the home? I have no excuse. I just failed to be a mother and home-maker.

"Surely America must have definite training for motherhood and home-making. I failed ignominiously.

"It is almost 12 midnight. I go now. I have sat here writing and have not looked at the children. What would I not give to be able to go back a few years and make a real home for them! The child's environment must have closer supervision, and parents should be compelled to live simple lives and provide the home and garden or yard required for the child's development. Lord's Prayer and 'Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep' is good, but it isn't enough. They must have protection, peace, and quiet, in the home. The environment must be one of loving-kindness and tender mercy. How did I miss the way?"

### PARENTAL SELF-ABSORPTION

Less tragic but far more common is another type of parental killing. This leaves the body untouched, but chokes off the bloom of happiness in young people's lives by destructive indifference; and this is true particularly in matters of courtship and marriage. As inexplicable as this may be, parents are often completely unconcerned about the associations, pastimes, and heart problems of their sons and daughters. How many letters of almost inconsolable grief have come to me from parents who have seen the marriage of their children end in bitter failure! How much futile weeping would be stopped if parents always generously provided opportunities for the sympathetic exchange of confidences! The lamentable absence of heart-to-heart talks often results in actual estrangement between parents and children, making both lead separated lives, each with private ambitions and personal cares, — strangers under the same roof.

In an investigation which I conducted in one of St. Louis County's outstanding high schools attended by children from some of the best families in the community, it was found that more than half of the pupils were away from home between the hours of seven and ten on the night preceding the date of the questionnaire. While only twenty-seven of the approximately 300 boys and girls did not regularly frequent the movies, one third of the entire student-body went at least once a week and another third at least twice a week. Some found their way to the motion-pictures as frequently as four and five times a week. The most serious condition was revealed in the answer to the question: "Do your parents insist that you stay home a certain number of evenings each week?" Almost half of the entire high school indicated that parents imposed no restrictions but indiscriminately permitted their children to spend their evenings away from home.

Similar investigations in other sections of the country present even more alarming figures. A physical-education teacher in a Cleveland junior high school states that only 8 per cent of his 800 junior-high-school boys stay home nights. In The Second Line of Defense Margaret Slattery tells of a census embracing a group of homes with daughters ranging from thirteen to nineteen years. The investigation included sixty such families, but only five girls of this age were found at home between half past eight past nine in the evening.

Nation-wide attention was attracted by "The Case of Youth versus Society," a trial conducted by the Social Agencies of the Oranges and Maplewood, New Jersey, May 3, 1935. The indictment drawn up in strict legal form by a youthful grand jury presented among other the following counts:

"Society is indicted for indifference to, and ignorance of, the problems of youth in respect to

"Marriage (and the problems relating thereto):

"a. Inadequate instruction on the subject of choosing a mate.

"b. Allowing conditions to exist under which young people of marriageable age are unable to marry die to lack of employment."

"c. Inadequate sex education...

"Moral Code:

"a. Allowing the continued and flourishing existence of pitfalls for youth, such as obscene literature, saloons, and gambling devices.

"b. Failure to attempt serious moral education in the home, school, or church."

In the verdict, society was found guilty of inadequate instruction on the subject of choosing a mate but not guilty on the charge of failure to attempt serious moral education in the home, school, and church.

Would this "not guilty" verdict be sustained in other sections of the country?

While large numbers of young people would unquestionably resent any display of parental interest in their friendships, too many parents live on in stolid apathy concerning their children's companions. Here is the overbusy mother with a full routine of meetings and social functions that take her away from her home day after day. What if she does not know even the names of the young men who are seen in her daughter's company nor the places where she spends her evenings? The bravado of false security may try to quiet the voice of any surviving maternal conscience by insisting that her daughter is a good girl, that she is old enough to take care of herself, sensible enough to choose the right friends! Or here is the disinterested mother who is totally unconcerned about making the home attractive for her grown children or who refuses to permit them to entertain their friends at home. The inevitable consequence is that public dance-halls and centers of commercialized amusement are overcrowded, that a mother's influence, which should be a permeating force in the lives of her children and in the choice of their friends, often registers an absolute zero.

A few years ago the city of Houston was rocked by startling disclosures of moral delinquency particularly among young people of high-school age. Newspapers joined hands with city authorities and church officials to check the shocking conditions revealed by the official investigation. In reading the printed reports, one cannot but be reminded of St. Paul's catalog of the terrible sins for which he indicts the natural man. These young people of Houston ran through the whole gamut of passions and vice and so brazenly flouted pure, clear living that the city was gripped by the realization of debauchery in its midst.

It would be a mistake to localize these unfortunate occurrences in one city. We are convinced that they obtain in every large city. It would be equally unfair to ascribe these conditions to the influence of the high school. And it would be optimism that borders on the edge of blind credulity to assume that Christian young people are separated by an insuperable gulf from this contamination. In the whirl of worldliness earnest young people from the best of our Christian homes sometimes are removed by only a step from temptation and moral aberration.

Who, then, can be their guide through the maze of this lecherous environment? Who else than their divinely appointed guardians and protectors, their fathers and mothers, who have the charge to bring up their children "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord"? Students of the distressing situation in Houston found the parents at fault in many cases. The bishop of the Episcopalian Diocese of Texas charged: "The parents are to blame! The young people are just keeping up with their elders." The president of the Houston Ministerial Alliance declared: "The conditions do not show so much a breakdown in moral fiber as a delinquency on the part of their elders in showing the youth the right way to conduct."

For years, educators have been measuring the influences by which children's attitudes are molded and their ideals shaped. We have gone through an imposing array of suggestions in which psychologists and scientists and educational experimenters have listed diet, ventilation, schoolroom environment, physical characteristics, mental training, as among those human factors which most clearly influence youthful behavior and attitudes. This has been a fertile field in which the seeds of speculation have been sown with amazing abandon.

Now, however, a return seems to be in progress. Dr. John B. Morgan, professor of psychology at Northwestern University, expresses an opinion which the Christian Church has always endorsed, by reporting that "clinical studies and logical analyses have long given the home credit for the greatest influence in determining the attitudes and wants of the young child. But," he adds, "recent studies have shown that the home influence is even more significant and enduring than we supposed. With children from the fifth to the eighth grade it was found the dominant factor in the child's knowledge of right and wrong was the home, with the greatest influence coming from the mother." He unhesitatingly asserts that parental influences were found to be much greater than those of Sunday-school teachers.

Parents must remember that, whether their children spend their eternity in heaven or in hell, whether they rise to success or sink in failure, whether they find happiness or misery in the choice of a companion for life, depends to a large extent on their home training, the example of father and mother, the intelligent, sympathetic, unselfish interest which their parents display in the affairs of courtship and marriage. Parents are pivotal. Their children's happiness, the noblest issues in the lives of their offspring, revolve around the center of parental interest. One of the deep-grooved tragedies of our age is the unmistakable indifference on the part of parents toward this basic truth.

How encouraging is the contrast presented, for instance, by Mrs. Elias Compton, who holds the distinction of having received an honorary degree of LL. D. for "the success of her sons and daughters"! Besides, the American Mothers' National Committee of the Golden Rule Foundation named Mrs. Compton "the American Mother for 1939, representative of the best there is in woman-hood." She is the mother of this distinguished group of children: Dr. Karl T. Compton, president of Massachusetts Institute of Tech-nology; Dr. Arthur Holly Compton of the University of Chicago, Nobel Prize winner and cosmic-ray expert; Wilson Compton, Washington lawyer, economist; and Mrs. Charles H. Rice, wite of the principal of Ewing Christian College at Allahabad, India. With a marked modesty she describes her success and blessings in this short sentence: "I was guided by common sense and the Bible." Her husband, dean emeritus of Wooster College, filled in the details by stating: "Mother always begins the day with prayer. Though we have told that often, newspapers somehow never considered that news."

Happiness in the marriage careers of the children is promoted by the joy they have experienced in their homes and seen reflected in their own parents' lives. In a nine-year study of the factors that make or break marriage Burgess and Cottrell (Predicting Success or Failure in Marriage, 1939) show that the probabilities for gratifying marriage are increased whenever the couple's parents are happily wed.

### FATHER, KEY-MAN IN OUR SOCIAL ORDER

Now, the mother is more important than the father, at least to girls of the teen age, according to Dr. Anne H. McAllister, in her report to the British Association for the Advancement of Science at its annual convention in Bristol, 1930. An examination of 253 original stories written for children by eighteen-year-old girls, future teachers in English schools, revealed that only one fifth of these stories mentioned the father at all and then usually as the parent administering punishment for wrong-doings. In the ordinary role of every-day life, fathers frequently have little time and less interest for their children. Miss Ellen Wilkinson, Labor member of the British Parliament, admired practically everything in America except this paternal indifference. Speaking over a radio network, she said: "I simply could not understand why, when American homes are so comfortable, American husbands seem to spend so little time in them. Why, if you are asked to stay in American homes, do you so rarely see the husband? There are intelligent daughters, gay, good-looking sons; but where is Father? American youngsters in their early-to-bed stage must think of Father as the voice at the other end of the telephone, for Father is always working. Perhaps one of the effects of our present depression will be to introduce these hard-working husbands to their charming families."

In a disproportionate manner mothers have consequently often assumed the practical direction of home-life, the husband sometimes being reduced to a mere provider, a general handy man for the family. Elsie Robinson, syndicate writer, scores the neglected paternal authority in this outspoken protest: "Mother-worship has become a vicious racket and wide-spread menace. There is indeed no nobler thing on earth than the love of a fine and intelligent mother. But there are several things just as noble — among them the love of a fine and intelligent father."

We have a Father's Day, of course; but how many of us know its exact date? Even a full-fledged holiday, with all attendant pomp and publicity, could not compensate for the lost authority of American fatherhood nor remove the social hazards created by the frequent eclipse of the American father, the key-man in the present social order.

We must remember that, according to divine social standards, fathers, not mothers alone, are given the command to bring up their children "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord" (Eph. 6:4). It is a false philosophy of home-life which develops this argument: "I earn the money for food and clothing and shelter, and my wife must do the rest. I look after the family interests outside of the home, while she directs its welfare within the home." Even the complexities of our modern life cannot bring exemption from the sacred responsibility of supervising the education, spiritual care, and moral growth of those in his household. Above the Chief Parts of the Catechism Luther placed the admonition that "a father should teach them diligently to his household." The great Reformer insisted: "No one should become a father unless he is able to instruct his children in the Ten Commandments and in the Gospel, so that he may bring up true Christians."

Fathers knowing that they are ordained by God to be the heads of their families must find time to meet the demands of their exalted position. If they are preoccupied with business or social obligations, some of these should be dropped.

Parental authority must be firm, though not tyrannical. Modern trends in child-training protest vigorously. A popular writer on questions of the home, for example, believes that the home is often "an autocracy instead of a democracy," and he rejoices that "heavy father stuff" is a thing of the past. But jurists who preside over juvenile courts, as well as social workers and pastors, who meet humanity at its worst, of course, tell us that the collapse of parental authority is one of the major factors in the staggering rise of youthful delinquency.

Men must retain a sympathetic feeling for their children's activities and find means of developing a happy companionship with their family. We are not, however, in favor of a loose familiarity. On the contrary, we agree whole-heartedly with Judge Aarons of Milwaukee: "Fathers are overdoing this pal stuff. When a father claps his hands on his boy's shoulders and talks the slang of the street with him, the father belittles himself, and the boy loses respect for his father. Fathers should not be knock-around pals with their boys, as some like to think, but there should be a fine, sympathetic relationship between the two generations."

Pointedly does Mrs. Compton say: "I'm a bit concerned about putting all the emphasis on the mother in the home. While I believe a mother's influence is strongest in the early years, I feel, too, that the sympathetic cooperation of the father is essential at all times. When a boy comes to a certain age, he feels his father knows better how to advise him along specific lines than does his mother. And, too, he is more apt to follow his father's example, even though his mother's influence continues throughout his years. I have known fathers to evade moral responsibility by saying, 'I leave it to my wife to train the children in morals and religion? I had a wonderful husband, who wielded great influence in the character-building of my children — a certain something that I as a mother could not give."

Fathers must give a stimulating example to their children, particularly in meeting their spiritual duties; for the word of paternal counsel will fail when contradicted by the life of the counselor. Every man should try to measure the personal importance of the Scriptural appeal: "Fathers, provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged" (Col. 3:21).

These principles accepted, the relation between fathers and children will be marked by rich blessings. Luther wrote to Melanchthon that everything he was or had he had received from his Creator through his beloved father. Theodore Roosevelt declared: "My father was the best man I ever knew." Albert Schweitzer, medical missionary and one of the most heroic characters of the present day, ascribes some of his happiest attainments to his Sunday afternoons with his father. Henry Adams praised the table-talk which he always heard in his parental home, and he said that his father had a more perfect equanimity than any other man he knew.

How stimulating is this reminiscence excerpted from the Memoirs of Prince von Buelow, a German statesman and diplomat of the last generation (Vol. 4, p. 21; translated by Geoffrey Dunlap and F. A. Voigt): "It is to my father that I chiefly owe my intellectual training. He laid the foundations of my education. I look upon the Bible and Homer as these foundations. My father called to mind the words addressed by St. Paul to his righteous son in spirit Timothy, to whom he wrote that all Scripture, given by God served for teaching, for punishment, for improvement, and for chastisement in righteousness... We read the Bible every day; and when I first went to school, I had already read the whole of the Old Testament and of course the New as well. I knew about fifty selected hymns by heart."

The world suffers because there are not more men who sustain memories in their sons' souls like those recorded in John G. Paton's Autobiography. As a boy this self-effacing missionary to the South Sea Islands used to crouch outside his father's prayer-or ate and linen to that spin al o this life. try vec in temple I hope that the Lord is more near, more visibly walking and talking with men, than under that humble cottage roof of thatch and oaken wattles. Though everything else in religion were by some unthinkable catastrophe to be swept out of memory, my soul would wander back to those early scenes and would shut itself up once again in that sanctuary closet and, hearing still the echoes of these cries to God, would hurl back all doubt with the victorious appeal, 'He walked with God; why may not I?' There were eleven of us brought up in a home like that. In this world and the world to come all the children of James and Janet Paton will rise at mention of their names and call them blessed."

Regina Hartmann, ancestress of the late Secretary Woodin, was reunited with her family by hearing the hymns which her father had taught her sung by her long-lost mother. It is to this same spirit of paternal devotion that many young people must trace the happiness of their own home-life.

Sometimes it takes the fear of sickness, parting, or death to bring fathers into the proper sphere of thought. When Charles Wesley was in his teens, he was placed before a vital decision. A wealthy Irishman had become interested in Charles because his name, too, was Wesley, Garret Wesley. This man was a member of Parliament and owned vast stretches of land. Having no children of his own, he sought to adopt Charles and offered him a beautiful home and the attractions of almost everything that money could buy. The lad was even given the assurance that, when Garret Wesley died, he would inherit all his land and money. In his excitement Charles wrote home to his father, a clergyman in a poor country parish with a small salary, which was to be shared by a large family. He, however, refused to influence him. As Charles reflected on the problem, the conviction soon grew within him that he could not forsake his own father, even for the attractions of wealth and comfort. His decision was quickly made, and he began a career which was to make him a great religious poet.

### PARENTAL AUTOCRACY

Parental sin often lies not only in selfish absorption but also in autocratic dictation. Some parents selfishly make the home so uncongenial and assume such a domineering attitude in questions of their children's marriage that growing sons and daughters, eager to maintain their self-respect, find conditions intolerable and leave home. Captain John Ayres, in command of the Bureau of Missing Persons in New York City, which annually deals with 25,000 runaways, traces the fact that many young people are listed as missing to the uncongenial homes in which parents (particularly those from the Old World) try to wield absolute sway over their children's lives, without any consideration of their feelings.

Altogether too frequently parents become match-makers and, in accord with the matrimonial convention of a narrow age or a backward nation, select life partners for their children, disregarding entirely the latter's personal preference. In ancient Babylonia daughters were sold into matrimony-for-money alliances; in the Middle Ages, Elizabeth, wife of Landgrave Lewis, was betrothed to her husband in her infancy and at the age of four was taken in a silver cradle to the Wartburg, where she was to live in happy childhood with her future husband; and these made-to-parental-order marriages, while happily less frequent than in those past ages, still blight some youthful lives.

Modern parents may well be guided by the principles expressed in a letter from George Washington to his old friend Colonel Bur-well Bassett: "It has ever been a maxim with me through life neither to promote nor to prevent a matrimonial connection, unless there should be something indispensably requiring interference in the latter. I have always considered marriage as the most interesting event in one's life, the foundation of happiness or misery. To be instrumental therefore in bringing two people together who are indifferent to each other and may soon become objects of disgust or to prevent a union which is prompted by the affections of the mind, is what I never could reconcile with reason." (George Washington Himself, by John C. Fitzpatrick, p. 449.)

Some parents unhappily destroy the confidence of their children by persistently prying into their private affairs. In one of the syndicated columns of a metropolitan newspaper an indignant young lady writes: "I am a woman well in my twenties. I am intelligent, trustworthy and capable, hold down a good job, support myself, and pay my way at home. Nevertheless, my mother treats me as if I were a nitwit child of three, and she feels that she has the right to dominate my life in every way. She opens all of my letters and reads them before I see them myself, and frequently I have the embarrassment of having the family discuss the contents of my letters that I have not seen. Have adult children no rights as long as they stay at home?"

The answer obviously is that the children not only have rights, but especially also are entitled to trust and confidence in personal matters, at least until they show themselves unworthy. Many a weeping mother who laments that she is not understood by children and that they do not confide in her has destroyed that possibility by adopting gumshoe tactics or robbing her children of an honest sense of independence. While young people should never send or receive communications which cannot be read by other eyes, fathers and mothers should not insist upon censorship privileges nor, least of all, assume them surreptitiously.

Some parents have gone to the extreme of confiscating their children's letters. That spoiled the only romance in the life of Joseph Mallard Turner, England's greatest landscape artist. Early in his youth he met in Yorkshire the girl whom he learned to love deeply. Constantly he wrote her, filling the pages of many letters with expressions of his devotion. But the young lady's stepmother regarded Turner as only the son of an insignificant Maiden Lane barber, and she had little confidence in the ability of any painter to provide for her stepdaughter. So she intercepted all the letters from the young artist, who in a few years was to be elected to membership in the British Royal Academy. The girl, who interpreted the absence of letters as evidence of neglect, married another suitor and suffered much unhappiness, while disillusioned but illustrious Turner became a sullen recluse and a misanthrope.

### "IN-LAWS" - DOMESTIC OUT-LAWS

Direction of children's affairs by inconsiderate parents becomes particularly dangerous after marriage, when, for example, a doting mother feels herself called upon to manage the affairs of the new household, to champion her daughter at the least provocation, and, generally, to inject her presence and advice - often an entirely unnecessary intrusion — into the affairs of the newly-weds. No nation-wide statistics present the percentages of blighted marriages by the interference of the "in-laws"; but Colgate University investigators, who sent out questionnaires to the married men and women in Who's Who in America, learned that slightly more than 25 per cent of the men answering and almost as many women listed as one of their chief marital difficulties - the second in importance in the entire list — the unwelcome interference of relatives through marriage. The American Association for the Advancement of Science on June 27, 1933, heard a report by Dr. Leonard S. Cottrell, Jr., of the University of Chicago, who analyzed the probabilities of successful marriage adjustments and presented statistics on the home-wrecking propensities of dictatorial mothers-in-law. When a young bride can toss a defiant head and assert with finality that she is going back to Mother, knowing full well that her indulgent parent will only fan the flames of her outraged feelings; or when a young husband is everlastingly beset by a jealous mama who can find no commendable qualities in the young woman of his choice; or when a mother-in-law swoops down upon the household that has not entirely emerged from its honeymoon enchantment and immediately assumes a self-appointed role of majordomo, even in matters of food and furniture, this domination may quickly become a contributory cause to marital discord.

Among the Yurok Indians on the lower Klamath River, Northern California (according to studies in marriage and kinship customs among these aborigines, published by T. T. Waterman and A. L. Kroeber), the brave who lives with his wife's parents or even near them is regarded as only half married. Wherever possible the Yurok bridegroom avoids remaining near his mother-in-law and father-in-law. It is only when financial embarrassment prevents him from paying the full bridal price that he is forced to enter into this "50-per-cent" marriage.

On the other hand, a Christian attitude will hallow this mother-in-law relationship. A reminiscence of Helen Chappell White draws this almost ideal picture: "I went to a funeral the other day, the funeral of a woman of nearly eighty, who had spent the last ten years of her life in her daughter's home, entirely dependent on that daughter and her husband financially, the most difficult and potentially unhappy position that any mother-in-law could face. And, believe it or not, the chief mourner at that funeral was her son-in-law, a big, husky chap, who broke down and sobbed like a baby. Afterwards he told me, red-eyed: 'Something has gone out of our lives and our home. She was a blessing to us all; it won't be the same without her.'

"Later the wife in this home added what was perhaps a very significant statement: 'My mother was a very unusual woman. She never criticized anything in our home. She never adopted an antagonistic attitude toward the activities of the young people. She never seemed to feel we were neglecting her when we were all busy. She had plenty of interests of her own and was good company for herself, glad to have us, but independent of us, too. She never demanded affection and attention as a right nor complained that we did not give her enough. And so, because she asked nothing, she got everything. Because her room was the happiest spot in the house, it was the one where we all liked best to gather. Because she was never harsh or unsympathetic but always kind and candid, we took her into all our problems and asked and accepted her advice.'"

Edgar Allen Poe loved his mother-in-law with an intense devo-tion, chiefly because she had given life to his beloved wife, Virginia. Let James A. Harrison (Works of Edgar Allen Poe, Vol. I, pages 182, 183) first describe Poe's deep-souled affection for his wife: "I have seen him hovering around her when she was ill with all the fond fear and tender anxiety of a mother for her first-born — her slightest cough causing in him a shudder, a breast chill, that was visible. I rode out one summer evening with them, and the remembrance of his watchful eyes eagerly bent on the slightest change of hue in that lovely face haunts me yet as the memory of a sad strain. It was his hourly anticipation of her loss that made him a sad and thoughtful man and lent a mournful melody to his undying song." And then read these lines from his sonnet written to Mrs. Clemm, the mother of his wife, Virginia:

TO MY MOTHER

Because I feel that in the heavens above
The angels, whispering to one another,
Can find among their burning terms of love
None so devotional as that of "Mother,"
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you,
You who are more than mother unto me
And filled my heart of hearts, where Death installed you,
In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
My mother, my own mother, who died early,
Was but the mother of myself; but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew.

This exemplary attitude is not inborn and natural. It must be acquired, and it is the ennobling Spirit of Christ who removes the stigma which the world has placed on the "in-law" relationship.

### THE SINS OF THE CHILDREN

Far more disturbing than parental indifference and selfishness is filial aloofness. Because young people have never before lived their lives with the independence they enjoy today, many modern courtships completely ignore paternal opinion and maternal advice. A young man meets an attractive girl, and in a few weeks' time an engagement is announced, and the parents, without knowing whether the two young people are compatible, simply acquiesce and at best give their consent by silence.

Comparisons are generally odious, particularly when the halcyon days of yesteryear are compared with the present "utter degeneracy." Almost every generation has its "mauve decade," but the eye of memory is often blind to the decadence of its own past. Yet sometimes a deep-grounded appeal comes to us from the years that have gone before. In the early eighties of the past century Peal's Popular Educator, the official guide in matters of etiquette and general conduct a half century ago, suggests the following correspondence covering a young lady's falling in love while away from home:

"My dear Mama: I have a serious matter to confess to you, at which I hope you will not feel angry. It seems almost ungrateful to think of loving any one but you; but, O Mama, if you saw Henry Lenning, you would forgive me, I am sure. He is so handsome, so gentle in his manners, and yet so sensible and so accomplished! We met at a party given by your old friend Mrs. Grayson, and he scarcely quitted my side the whole evening. Mrs. Grayson has so high an opinion of him that she repeatedly invited him to her house, until his visits have become almost a daily occurrence. He is most honorable and straightforward and only waits permission to write to you in order to give you full particulars as to his condition and prospects. Forgive me, dear Mama, when I tell you that my feelings are deeply enlisted in his favor and that I feel as if much of my future happiness depended on our union. I wish you were here to counsel and advise me, for never before did I so much feel my own heart master of my reason. I hope you will write directly or come immediately to your affectionate, but anxious child, Minnie Howson."

To this the mother replied:

"My dear Child: Make yourself perfectly at ease as to my consent to anything that will promote your happiness. If Mr. Lenning proves to be what you represent, my fondest wish that you might meet a desirable partner in life will be realized. At the same time do not be too hasty to give an unqualified assent to his proposals but take time to study his character and disposition through a longer acquaintance. I shall be in Boston on the fifteenth, and I shall be delighted not only to meet my dear child again but to be introduced to the man whom she has thought so worthy of her affections. Your ever loving mother, Gertrude Howson."

Like the manufacture of Mesopotamian glaze and Egyptian dye, such solicitous exchanges of mutual confidences between mothers and daughters seem to have been irretrievably lost. In our breath-taking, speed-it-up age this lengthy heart-to-heart correspondence might be reduced to the following telegram, sent "collect" to the mother:

"Congratulate me. That mousseline-de-soie frock broke his defense mechanism. Wedding in June. Min."

### THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE

Ultimately the choice of a life-partner is vested in the children, not the parents. Fathers and mothers sometimes assume this privilege, but inherently it is the sacred right of the son and daughter. Parents may object to the choice of a companion for life, but this veto should rest upon Scriptural grounds. For instance, if the proposed marriage disregards the forbidden degrees of relationship, Christian parents are bound by solemn duty to protest; or, again, if a Christian son would become allied with an unbelieving, scoffing wife, devoted parents, according to the Word of God, must do their best to dissuade him.

Unless Biblical support can be shown for parental opposition, it cannot be made a matter of conscience or claim validity in the Church. In a grasping age some parents are apt to insist on matches that are financially attractive but which utterly disregard the personal affection of their child. An instance of this not altogether infrequent attitude is described in the reminiscences of a busy pastor: "Only recently a young girl, but of marriageable age, came and confided to me a crushing burden. She had a lover to whom she was attracted. There could be no reasonable objection to her mar-riage, but her father stoutly opposed it on the ground that he needed her in his business. He was prosperous. He could afford to employ help, and his living would not be jeopardized if his daughter withdrew from his business. This father gave way to covetousness and for that reason interfered with the happiness of his daughter. I led her out into the light, helped her analyze the case, shed the light of the Bible on it. I told her that her father by his example in entering marriage weakened his own argument, - he had forsaken his parents, had established a new relation, — and that she had a perfect right to take the same step. I told her that parents may even forbid what God allows, that they may give way to sinful, selfish motives which will not stand in the sight of God. She left me comforted, and it was not so long afterward that she was led to the altar and has since become the happy mother of two beautiful children." (Schuh, Happy Family, p. 102.)

Children must always be guided by filial patience and respect; but when parental prohibitions are based on such superficial grounds as feudal dislike of the family into which their child is to marry, the inability to play the piano or show similar accomplishments, the claim of too much culture or not enough culture, social or occupational standing; when objections are based on personal whims and parental idiosyncrasies, they are not binding for Christian children, who, overriding these vetoes, may finally enter marriage without any qualms of conscience. As early as 1641 the code of laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony specifically provided that, "if any parents shall wilfully and unreasonably deny any child timely or convenient marriage or shall exercise any unnatural severity towards them, such children shall have free liberty to complain to authority for a redress."

A hundred years before that Pilgrim age Martin Luther, engrossed in the direction of world-moving concerns, paused to reprove a mother for selfishly withholding her maternal blessing. One of his protégés was John Schneidewin, who, like many others, apparently boarded with Luther while preparing for the ministry. John fell in love with the daughter of a Wittenberg citizen, much to the displeasure of his mother, who lived at some distance. In order to placate the maternal anger, Luther took the time to engage in this one-sided correspondence, which states clearly the Church's attitude on the wilful refusal of parents to sanction their children's choice:

"To the honorable, virtuous Lady Ursula Schneidewin, widow, citizen at Stollberg, my kind, good friend.

"Grace and peace in Christ! Honorable, virtuous dear Lady: I have written to you concerning your son John that he has conceived a great love for an honorable maiden here; and as you must have received my opinion, I hoped you might have given a favorable answer; but as the delay appears to me too long, I feel it necessary to urge you further. For I am not unfavorably disposed towards him and would not that he should be driven to despair. As, therefore, the maiden so greatly pleases him, is not unequal to him in station, it appears to me that you may well be con-tented, since he has humbled himself as a child and begged for the maiden as did Samson. Therefore it is fitting for you, as a loving mother, to give your consent; for though we have written that children should not betroth themselves without the consent of their parents, we have also written that parents, according to God's will, should not, nor can they, control or hinder their children at their own pleasure. No son should bring a daughter to his parents without their consent; but also a father should not force a wife upon his son. They should do their best on both sides; otherwise the son's wife must become the father's daughter without his approval. Who knows what happiness God may provide for your son by means of this maiden, which, perhaps, otherwise may be lost to him, especially as the good maiden gives fair hopes, is not unequal in station, and her sorrow might become a curse? In short, I beg you will no longer delay your assent, that the good fellow may be relieved from his disquiet. For I cannot delay longer but must take measures on account of my office. But I beg you will not let this letter be known to your son John; for he ought not to know it till the matter is settled that he may not be too confident and bold. For I love him, of which he is well worthy, on account of his goodness and therefore would not advise him to his harm. Therefore do your part as a mother and relieve him from this torment that he may not be obliged to act in spite of you. Herewith, God be with you! Amen.

"Wednesday after Trinity, 1539 Martinus Luther, Dr."

Despite this urgent appeal Ursula Schneidewin did not answer. With his characteristic patience Luther waited more than a month longer and then penned a third letter, from which these extracts have been taken:

"Grace to you and peace in Christ! Honorable and virtuous Lady. If I am not mistaken, I have written to you twice concerning your son John, who as a good son has begged you through me to show yourself a kind mother and give your consent to his marriage with this maiden, thereby doing his duty as a son.... I have also told you that I can no longer delay but think fit, as I propose to stand by him, that he should be delivered from this danger; for I see that his studies are hindered and that no good can come if you are so harsh with him. What I do is for your honor; she is his equal, the child of good people. Besides, you must bethink you that it is not bearable that the children of other people should be excited to love and afterwards be neglected without cause. This you would hardly suffer to be done by your own children; therefore it must not be, especially where it is a question of marriage. I have further written and advised that you should not refuse, so that we may not be compelled to proceed notwithstanding. ... It is so annoying to me that my boarder should delude our citizen's daughter that I again beg you will give a speedy, favorable answer; otherwise we must do what we can to prevent scandal. You have been sufficiently entreated. When parents will not decide, the pastor must... I will never, as long as I live, abandon John; nevertheless he himself will, God willing, prosper without my help. I therefore beg you will show signs of life; for I am weary of writing so often on a matter in which you have no reason to object... Herewith, God be with you! Amen. And a short, right answer from you.

"Thursday after Kiliani, 1539 Martinus Luther, Dr."

Even Christian parents require prayer to counteract the selfishness attached to the thought of parting from a devoted child. Robert Moffat, intrepid missionary, was in love with Mary Smith, who returned his affection. When Moffat was called to the wilds of South Africa, Mary's parents insisted that she remain in Man-chester. She was the only daughter, they reminded her, and they were growing older. How could they sacrifice her even for so worthy a cause as the conquest of heathen strongholds? So Moffat went out to endure the hardships of a pioneer missionary alone, consoling himself with the hope that some day he might be united with his loved one. The unwillingness of Mary's parents grew until finally she was forced to write the missionary that she could never go to Africa. Then letters that had been seven or eight months in transit arrived in Manchester from the mission-fields. They told unmistakably, although not in complaint, of hardship and loneliness; and they led Mary Smith's parents to reconsider their decision. On a December evening, kneeling in prayer before the fireplace, they fought their own desires and emerged victorious. Their Mary went to Africa and became the wife of the man who later translated the Bible into the language of his African followers and was the human agency in saving many souls for eternity.

### "THOU SHALT HONOR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER"

In Christian families parents are prompted by love, guided by practical wisdom, and moved by unselfish considerations. Young people may not always be able to see their point of view at first, but larger experience, more mature judgment, and trust in the parental love and guidance will usually afford better understanding of the parental objections.

Some, of course, consider the honor due parents an outworn delusion. Dr. John Levy, assistant professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and head of the Child Guidance Clinic of that university's medical center, told a research clinic in New York City on February 15, 1936, that "the old conception of the child owing love and respect to them [the parents] as such, irrespective of merit, must perish. The child is an individual, owing allegiance to himself alone. The home exists solely to provide for the full personal satisfaction of all its members. A far cry, this commonplace of today, from the 'duty' of the child to honor his father and his mother."

Similarly Dr. John E. Anderson of the University of Minnesota deliberately tells parents: "Don't worry about obedience! The adult world pays seventy-five to eighty dollars a month for obedience, but for stubbornness, initiative, and enthusiasm it pays salaries in five or six figures." Now, however, comes Dr. Henry C. Link, director of the Psychological Service Center of New York City, and in his frequently printed and widely quoted Return to Religion he would restore parents to new and commanding heights of importance, particularly in the courtship and marriage of their children. Dr. Link is a scientist, not a preacher, and his religious ideals are far from ours. His testimony, therefore, in a certain sense, may be the more impressive to some. When he writes: "I have a great deal of respect for the old-fashioned procedure by which parents selected mates for their children and then told the young couple to make the best of it," and when he deliberately continues, "The privilege of selecting one's own mate or marrying at one's own pleasure is by no means an unmixed good" (quoted with permission of the publishers, The Macmillan Company), he throws a bombshell into the self-expressionistic tendencies our day.

A mere sense of gratitude should remove this selfish disregard of the parents. The American Research Foundation has shown that the average young person who reaches eighteen years in the United States represents an investment of $7,250. Included in this cost is the expense of being born and all other charges thereafter except that of education in the public schools. If even an appreciation of the love and labor which this figure involves is not sufficient incentive for the grateful regard of the parents, we have the verdict of the highest authority, the Word of God. According to this standard it is a sacred duty of all children to show uninterrupted love to the father and mother who gave them life, who sustained them during the perils of infancy, and who bequeathed to them many of their opportunities for happiness and blessing. The Bible sets no time limit for filial honor. Human legislation establishes various ages as the legal majority, when children can act for themselves; but there is no such absolute independence of action according to the Scriptures.

We read these ordinances of Scripture: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right" (Eph. 6:1). "My son, hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother, for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck" (Prov. 1:8). The commandment which demands honor and love of father and mother is, according to the apostle's explanation, the one commandment with a specific promise. Parents are pivotal, we repeat, and the warning of the ancient proverb that parental blessing builds the children's homes while their curse destroys them, presents a frequent synopsis of human experience. Prodigious leaders in every branch of human activity have freely acknowledged as one of the most vital human contributions to their preeminence and the happiness of their home-life the love and guidance of their parents, the solicitous prayers and the unflagging interest of a self-sacrificing mother, the generous, deep-rooted Christlike life of a devout father.

Conversely, no one can find any happiness in disloyalty to his parents. Esau's marriages to Hittite women were so completely against the advice and entreaties of his parents that Rebecca tells Isaac: "I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth" (Gen. 27:46); and Esau drops out of history, leaving no contribution to the affairs of men. Samson is attracted to a Philistine woman. His parents object, but he obstinately insists, and his protest against their authority submerges him in a deep sea of matrimonial woe. Today, to skip over the centuries, an investigation of the married life of 526 Illinois couples by Dr. Leonard S. Cotrell, Jr., of the University of Chicago, shows that, if the marriage is opposed by the bride's father, it has less chance to succeed.

An illustrative incident comes to us from the annals of American sport, the unfortunate error committed by a captain-elect of the University of California's eleven in an annual Rose Bowl classic at Pasadena. Picking up a fumbled ball and starting down the field, this young man began a run which has secured for him an unenviable distinction and an unwelcome niche in the Hall of Football Defamation. It was not his speed nor the distance of sixty-nine yards which he covered that made his run notorious. It was the direction. For, while 70,000 Californians rose up in frenzy and shouted their warning; while his distracted team-mates vainly called and pulled and pleaded, the fleet-footed center darted away from the opponents' goal and sped toward his own goal, in exactly the wrong direction.

Today, too, they fly on toward the goal of disappointment, these young people who have never learned to understand the severity with which the contempt of parents is penalized, when the force of this Old Testament threat asserts itself: "Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother; and all the people shall say Amen" (Deut. 27:16). What happiness is sacrificed, what lasting joy of life shattered, what high hopes of the future blasted away, by the refusal of young men and young women today to follow the footsteps of that divine Paragon, the young Christ, who "went down with His parents and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them"! (Luke 2:51.)

Notable literary characters have followed as far as possible the example of our Lord in showing reverence to their parents. We have this brief but expressive letter of devotion from the pen of Dr. Samuel Johnson, an eighteenth-century model letter for many twentieth-century sons:

"Dear honored Mother: Neither your condition nor your character make it fit for me to say much. You have been the best mother and, I believe, the best woman in the world. I thank you for your indulgence of me and beg forgiveness of all that I have done ill and all that I have omitted to do well. God grant you His Holy Spirit and receive you to everlasting happiness, for Jesus' sake!"

Sir James Barrie, Scotch novelist and playwright, has left us some very human, yet deeply spiritual, experiences. In his biography of his mother, Margaret Ogilvy, he says: "She begins the day by the fireside with the New Testament in her hand. It is old, with its loose pages beautifully refixed. It is mine now, and the black threads with which she stitched it are a part of its contents." When old age enfeebled his mother, his care for her comfort in-creased. He tells us: "My mother and I go up the stairs together. "We have changed places,' she says; that was just how I used to help you up; but I'm the bairn now.' She brings out the New Testament again. It is always within reach. And when she has red fone wong time, she is my a look, mo the say of to lang with no earthly listener. Often have I found her upon her knees, but I always went softly away, closing the door."

On the very last page of Margaret Ogilvy the famed novelist writes this summary: "Everything I could do for her in this life I have done since I was a boy; I look back through the years, and I cannot see the smallest thing left undone."

How many of us can truthfully record the same devotion? Yet most of us are blessed and strengthened by the same measure of mother's love. A short sentence like Barrie's "Everything I could do for her in this life I have done since I was a boy" means more than Mother's Day carnations, sentimental cards, and raucous nightclub tenors crooning stilted lyrics with the mother motif.
