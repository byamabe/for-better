## "...AND OBEY"

Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the Church. - Eph. 5:25

What is the outstanding advance achieved in our much-heralded century of progress?

If the readers were called upon to designate the most phenomenal change in the past hundred years, their verdicts would betray many contradictory opinions. The commercial adaptation of electricity; the radio, telephone, and telegraph; the automobile, airplane, and submarine; X-rays, ultra- and infraspectrum rays and photography; the achievements of archeology in the Old and the New World, - these are but a few items in the long catalog of twentieth-century distinctions that straightway suggest themselves. Mechanically trained minds can enumerate a host of innovations that have fairly revolutionized American industry during the last decades. Professional men and women point to the lengthening strides of progress in medicine and surgery, in education and peda-gogy, even in the externals of law and church-work. Business leaders and industrial experts recite a ponderous series of fundamental improvements by which efficiency of production and methods of distribution have leaped with amazing bounds beyond the outmoded methods of nineteenth-century conservatism.

Yet I firmly believe that many of these astonishing evidences of progress assume only secondary importance when compared with the epoch-making change which subsequent history will designate as one of the most notable advances during the last one hundred years: the heights of prominence toward which womanhood has slowly, but steadily, climbed.

### THE FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS

Only about a century ago, in 1833, the first American college opened its doors to women students when Oberlin in Ohio established its "Female Department," dedicated to "the elevation of female character by bringing within the reach of the misguided and neglected sex all the instruction privileges which have hitherto unreasonably distinguished the leading sex from theirs." In the same year, in Jacksonville, Illinois, the first permanent women's club in our country was organized. Before 1833 drew to its close, the first women's organization with a political objective, the Philadelphia Female Antislavery Society, had its inception. Because these significant tendencies crystallized about a hundred years ago, and because an economic revolution, particularly in the young textile industry of New England, at that time took women out of the seclusion of the home, we speak, as Inez Haynes Irwin does in her book Angels and Amazons, of a "hundred years of American women."

The consideration now accorded the American woman as well as her entrée into practically all branches of human activity was not easily won. In 1840, at the world's Antislavery Conference in London, the fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who had been scheduled to speak before a vast audience, walked out in protest when the conference ruled that women delegates could take no part in the discussion but should remain modestly concealed behind the gallery screen, where they could listen, unseen, to the palaver of the men.

It was only in 1848 that young women were able to prepare for a professional career. In that year the first American institution for professional studies enrolled women students. Their alma mater was the Female Medical College in Boston, a school which specialized in scientific midwifery. During the same year Harriet Martineau, English authoress, came to the United States and found that women were admitted to but seven vocations: sewing, domestic service, tailoring, teaching school, music, nursing, and millinery.

In his issue of December, 1859, the editor of the North lowan Times relieved himself of this tall-corn philippic against emancipated girls who started "to unsex themselves" — by skating:

"There is much talked and written about this new exercise of women's rights. A plate in Harper's Holiday Pictorial will cure most ladies of all desire to learn the sublime art of converting their pedal extremities into sled runners.

"A handsome girl with her outer garments well tucked up and under limbs more than half exhibited, her delicate footsies shod with iron a la horse, shoving herself, one side at a time, ovér the glassy surface of the frozen lake... must be a picture which the imagination would long retain.

"Skating is healthy; so are hunting, fishing, and ball-playing. But the profits of exercise can be obtained by walking; and if that were practiced more, there would be no necessity for girls to unsex themselves for the amusement of the crowd. When girls take to ice, they stand on slippery places. Let female skating therefore be abolished!"

With all these setbacks and delays American women of the last generations have succeeded in the discriminations against their sex. An analysis of women's present-day economic activities tabulated in Occupation Statistics, a report of the fifteenth census, reveals arresting facts. In 1930 more than 1,886,000 women were employed as operatives in manufacturing and mechanical industries. About 2,000,000 women held clerical positions. Approximately 1,526,200 were engaged in the professions, including 870,000 teachers, 8,388 physicians, surgeons, and osteopaths, 20,131 college professors and presidents, 3,385 attorneys, and 3,276 woman clergymen.

We shall not now discuss this nation-wide exodus from the home; and indeed no good purpose is served in the attempt, however well meant, to lash seas moved by the irresistible ebb and flow of economic tides. We survey the seething masses of America's working-women as they daily rub elbows with cold competitive forces of modern business; and we may sigh for the home-centered life which would reemphasize the family as a productive unit and restore large numbers of our American young women to the sheltering protection of their homes. But all the sighs and fears will never take the American girl from the office, the factory, the pro-fessions, and bring her back to the yesteryear, when the well-bred young woman, disdainfully rejecting the very suggestion of manual labor or remunerative employment, often spent the greater part of a dilettante day in perusing the sententious literature of a crinoline age. Those days have passed forever. No one exults more in their passing than the keen-minded Christian young woman, happy in working, planning, achieving. Now that the discriminations which penalized womanhood have largely been removed, few can review the rising status of womanhood in this century of social progress without agreeing that here we have one of the most noteworthy preeminences of our age.

### THE FLARES OF FEMINISM

However, a consequence of womanhood's emergence from discrimination is that rabid, overbalanced emphasis on women's rights which, while claiming the privilege of parity with men, actually demands absolute independence. Largely through the efforts of such leaders as Mary Wollstonecraft, Annie Besant, Lucy Stone, Charlotte Gillman, Olive Schreiner, Ellen Key, Susan Anthony, Christabel Pankhurst, and through the allied support of writers like Mills, Ibsen, Shaw, an international crusade for sex equality was inaugurated, with this watchword emblazoned on its standards: "We mean to set women free" (Annie Besant, The Political Status of Women, p. 16). The factors of this freedom are frankly stated by Elizabeth S. Chesser in Woman, Marriage, and Motherhood (p. 275): "Women are striving for economic, legal, and sexual independence."

The marriage program of these militant feminists and their socialist cohorts is hostile to the Christian code. The ideal union, says this radical platform, is the marriage of two friends who are but the companions of pleasure. Since friendship is never exclusive and not necessarily permanent, husbands and wives must be free to maintain several friendships, to form new associations, and to refuse to have these connections impeded by children. Jane Alcott, ardent feminist, voices these sentiments in the New York Times: "A man or woman should be free to give love whenever it is natural. Love is volatile; and when it goes, I believe it is unmoral for man and wife even to appear to live together except for the sake of their children. In that case each should be free to bestow love elsewhere by mutual agreement."

These sentiments ally feminism with easy divorce and its consequent degeneracy. Mrs. Beatrice Hale (What Women Want, p. 267) candidly admits: "Feminists believe in divorce." They find, in the words of one of their clerical supporters, marriage too holy to be restricted by promise. "Until death you do part" is interpreted as a survival of serfdom.

Feminist leaders have even counseled wives to retain their maiden names. When Lucy Stone married Henry B. Blackwell, she inaugurated this practice; and the Lucy Stone League, an organization of like-minded women, has followed her example. Others have demanded that the wife retain her title "Miss" after marriage, abandoning the "Mrs." as an outworn discrimination.

To emphasize their equality with man, feminists insist that women must have a right to woo, even as a man enjoys the privileges of courtship. In conformity with the perversions practiced among some degenerate heathen, extreme feminists have demanded that the wife companion select her own husband companion. Most of us, however, appreciate Harriet Beecher Stowe's allusion to "the disgust which man feels when she whom God made to be sought degrades herself to seek." (Pink and White Tyranny, p. 269.)

Economic equality is another of the planks in the feminist plat-form. Ellen Key declares: "Only when the duty of support on the part of man ceases, will woman be able to demand the same chastity and fidelity from him as he demands of her." (The Woman Movement, p. 148.)

Even in matters of dress and conduct, in recreation and amusement, a sweeping equality is to prevail. In 1850 Helen Marie Weber, appearing at the Worcester (England) convention, prophesied that "in ten years' time male attire will be generally worn by the women of most civilized countries and that it will precede the consummation of many great measures which are deemed to be of paramount importance" (Proceedings, p. 78). Her enthusiasm overbid itself, although Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, the first woman to receive a medal of honor from Congress, affected male attire. Her penchant for men's clothes at first provoked discourtesy. Fortified by a Congressional sanction, Dr. Walker clung persistently to her unconventional frock coat, trousers, and high hat until her death in 1919, although this male attire never permitted her to forget for a moment that she wished to be treated as a lady. At one occasion, in a Capitol elevator, she snatched a cigar from the mouth of a male fellow-passenger and demanded: "Have you no more respect than to smoke in the presence of a lady?" The deliberate reply was to the point: "If you want the respect due a lady, you should dress like one, and maybe you will get it then."

If children come (although feminism is allied with artificial birth control), the radical champions of women's rights insist that the mothers be the guardians of their offspring. Laura Aberconway, The Nation (London), May 31, 1931, complains that "man is the only animal who denies to the mother the supreme control of the young." It is but a step from this exaggeration to the further insistence upon a modern matriarchy, the female domination of the home.

### THE ANTI-"OBEY" CAMPAIGN

Closely related is the indignant agitation for the removal of "obey" from the bride's marriage pledge. This movement has always been championed by ardent feminists. The Rev. Miss Anna Howard Shaw, suffragist leader, claimed that in her opinion it was "positively wicked to use this word [obey] in the marriage contract."

Recent efforts to ban the wifely obedience have originated within churches, and in several instances this agitation has been successful. Thus, in the revisions of the Prayer-Book of the Church of England, the Episcopal bishops have eliminated the debated term. No longer, according to the new version, will the bride alone promise "to love, cherish, and obey." Instead, her pledge will be made in unison with that of her husband; both promise "to love, cherish, and serve."

Miss A. Maude Royden, president of the League of the Church Militant of England, insists that the requirements of modern wedding vows are obsolete and hurls this denunciation against the "obey" pledge: "The marriage service in its.present form compels both the bride and bridegroom to take words on their lips which are not true. It is appalling to take a vow which she has no intention of keeping.... Taking out the promise to obey would raise the ideal of matrimony among the ignorant."

In our own country liberal church-bodies, like Dr. Charles Francis Potter's Humanist Society in New York, have adopted similar actions; and the question has been repeatedly aired before some of the more conservative church-bodies. In interviews with prominent St. Louis pastors of Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist, Unitarian, Baptist, Congregational, Jewish, Evangelical, and Catholic congregations it was found that not one used the word "obey" in his marriage service. Many emphasized that they purposely avoided the antagonizing word.

### "THE HUSBAND IS THE HEAD OF THE WIFE"

Now, the employment of the term "obey" is in itself a matter of only secondary importance. It'is far more imperative that there be a proper premarital understanding of the Biblical teaching in this question. As in other practical issues, the Scriptures speak clearly and finally. Here are some of its direct injunctions: "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord" (Eph. 5:22). "The husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the Head of the Church" (Eph. 5:23). "As the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every-thing" (Eph. 5:24). "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord" (Col. 3:18). These and other ordinances are New Testament reassertions of the fundamental rule instituted to establish the position of wifehood and womanhood for all lands and ages: "Unto the woman He said, ... Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee" (Gen. 3:16).

It must be evident from these passages that according to divine will the family, instead of having two heads, is to have one, the husband, to whom both God and man look for the direction of the domestic affairs. It is the husband who takes the initiative in establishing the union by his proposal for marriage; it is he who sustains it by his financial support; and it is he who must direct it according to Biblical requirements. The Scriptures are too definite to permit of any other interpretation; and when the ceremony asks the bride to pledge herself "to love, honor, and obey," this promise is in direct conformity with Heaven's ideal for the highest married happiness. It asks that the companionship of a helpful wife express itself in perpetual self-giving and find an exquisite joy even in the commonplace tasks. She will generously serve the interests of her husband by promoting his health and happiness, giving time and thought to the preparation of food, loving care to the neatness of the dwelling, and, in all, observing the preferences of her husband, even as the Church submits to Christ.

Charles Haddon Spurgeon, greatest of English pulpit orators, draws a charming picture of a Christian wife's devotion to her husband in lines that are said to be a veiled description of his wife, Susannah: "She delights in her husband, in his person, his character, his affection; to her he is not only the chief and foremost of mankind, but in her eyes he is all in all. Her heart's love belongs to him, and to him only. He is her little world, her Paradise, her choice treasure. She is glad to sink her individuality in his. She seeks no renown for herself; his honor is reflected upon her, and she rejoices in it. She will defend his name with her dying breath; safe enough is he where she can speak of him. His smiling gratitude is all the reward she seeks. Even in her dress she thinks of him and considers nothing beautiful which is distasteful to him. He has many objects in life, some of which she does not quite understand; but she believes in them all, and anything she can do to promote them she delights to perform. ... Such a wife, as a true spouse, realizes the model marriage relation and sets forth what our oneness with the Lord ought to be." (The Shadow of the Broad Brim, by Richard Ellsworth Day, p. 104.)

Even if a young woman makes the mistake of marrying an infidel husband, her allegiance to him in all things that do not restrict her Christian faith and life must be genuine. It is a remarkable blessing, repeatedly emphasized on the pages of church history, that the godly companionship of a Christian wife and her quiet, Christ-dedicated life have often achieved more than all other human factors combined in bringing an infidel husband into the faith.

Men recognize few spectacles more pathetic than that of a non-resisting husband who permits himself to be tyrannized by a dynamic wife. The last vestige of all sound happiness is sacrificed in those homes where shrewish women have not been tamed. The man who lives in perpetual apprehension of the disapproval which his wife may hurl upon an innocent pastime, the servile husband who answers the shrill and imperious summons of his wife with a docile "Yes, my deat," is an abject caricature of what people by common consent expect to find in a virile husband.

How often when an unusual opportunity for advancement is offered a young husband in another city, does his eagerness for promotion deflate itself as his wife petulantly insists that she will not leave with him! Unhappily he yields, and another promising career sinks into mediocrity. Or a husband with the endowment of hospitality wants to invite a group of congenial friends to spend a reminiscent evening with him; but an unmistakable nudge from his wife's sharp elbow seals the invitation behind silent lips. In a hundred ways men who toil and sweat for their families, from the depths of whose hearts comes an unrelieved yearning for happiness, find that their long-cultivated visions are but mirages on the desert of female dominion.

Because it is an evasion of divine order, the ascendency of female dominion may be an indication of national decline, particularly when we hear confident statements to the effect that before long a woman President will occupy our White House. We recall the prophetic voice of Isaiah raised in warning (chap. 3:12): "As for My people, women rule over them." Destruction, he predicted, would be the consequence. When Cato declared: "All men rule over women, we Romans rule over all men, and our wives rule over us," he did not exaggerate, although he may have been unaware that this rule by women would help spell the doom of Roman greatness.

Petticoat politics flourished at the time of the empire's greatest moral degeneracy and the collapse of Roman power closely followed this rejection of natural order, just as the French state collapsed when the frail fingers of the salonières, ambitious, ruth-less, scheming women of the decadent court, embroidered political designs, used their husbands as puppets, and tried to exercise the controlling voice in governmental affairs. Madame De Langeac could command lettres de cachet; Mademoiselle Renard could create officerships; Mademoiselle Guimard had it in her power to distribute benefices. Madame Geoffrin gave advice to a young man who asked her how to succeed: Make friends among women rather than among men; for through the women you can manage the men. (Emily Putnam, The Lady.) Dominated by these influences, the empire was doomed.

A happy marriage often dims the flare for feminism. The case of Margaret Fuller is illuminating. In her zeal for women's rights she proposed a female congress in Washington to compete with the regular male legislature; and without permitting herself to be restricted by false modesty, she offered to serve as the first female president. When she was thirty-seven years old, she married a poor Italian marquis whom a contemporary authority described as "the most beautiful man he had ever seen." The marriage changed the ardent feminist altogether. An American acquaintance who had known Margaret Fuller from her girlhood days wrote: "How unlike is she to the Margaret Fuller of the former days! The masculine intellectual gladiator ready to challenge all comers, is now so delicate, so simple, so confiding, so affectionate, with a true womanly heart and soul, and, what to me was a still greater surprise, possessed of so broad a charity that she could cover with its mantle the faults and defects of all about her!" (Some Queer People, by Ladbroke Black, p. 61 ff.)

### HUSBANDLY HEADSHIP — HOW FAR?

The question immediately arises, How far does the headship and priority of the husband extend? It must be remembered right at the outset that it does not embrace any spiritual superiority. In the caste-effacing appeal of the Savior's Gospel there is, as St. Paul pauses to emphasize, "neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus" (Gal. 3:28).

This removal of the high barriers that had excluded woman from the full benefits of religion stands out in sharp relief when contrasted with non-Christian religions. Near the White Sea lives a dwindling clan of a mongrel race, the Samoyedes, who unconditionally prohibit all women not only from taking a part in their religious practices but also from expressing any belief or creed. Religion is not for women, they hold, and they carry through to a drastic extreme the principle, widely endorsed by pagan philosophies, that women are almost soulless creatures, hardly more than animals or slaves. This is a logical inference even from the doctrines of Mohammed's Koran. For in the paradise of Islam, which has no special place for mortal wives, the men will be enthralled by the presence of the houris, their supernatural companions.

It follows that the wife cannot obey her husband in any request which militates against the Word of God. The Scriptural statement "We ought to obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29) obligates Christian women to refuse all requests of their husbands that run counter to divine requirements. If a tyrannical husband tries to prevent his wife from attending church; if he prohibits the reading of the Bible and insists that the children shall not be baptized; if he dictates some action that would be dishonest or detrimental to her health or well-being, a Christian wife cannot obey him in these demands and is absolved from any consequences which this refusal may entail. Today, after fifteen centuries, we can still feel the force of this complaint made by a Christian woman against her heathen husband as it is preserved on an ancient and intimate papyrus: "Whereupon a marriage deed was made, and after this agreement and his oaths he again hid the keys from me; and when I had gone out to the church at Sambatho, he had the outside doors shut on me, saying, 'Why did you go to church?' and using many terms of abuse to my face and through his nose." (Egyptian Papyri and Papyrus Hunting, James Baikie, p. 294.)

Neither does the rule of the husband embrace the domineering direction of those matters in which the free decision of the wife should be respected. In civic life, for example, a husband cannot compel his wife to vote the Republican or the Democratic ticket. While it is to be expected that normally the political ideals of both will be directed to a common goal, it may sometimes be contrary to the conscience of the wife to accept her husband's party affiliation. Again, the husband who has no ear for music should not issue a lord-of-the-manor decree to prevent his wife from playing the piano; or a "swing" devotee should not insist that the family radio be continually tuned to bizarre blares and prohibit his wife from enjoying the type of music which appeals to her.

Nor can we tolerate one code of morals for the husband and another for the wife. By an unfair double standard a husband's indiscretion is often glossed over as a peccadillo, while the same sin is branded as a serious moral lapse when committed by the wife. This distinction is age-old, as the Code of Hammurabi shows.

Again, the headship of the husband does not deprive the wife of her legal status or minimize her rights at law. In a famous compendium of Mohammedan jurisprudence, Manhaj et Thalibin, written by Al Nawai and still used throughout the Islamic world, we meet the hopeless legal status of a Mohammedan woman. She can be divorced at the caprice of her husband. We are told, in casuistic seriousness: "Where a husband and wife eat together some dates and mix the seeds and the husband says to the wife, 'If you don't separate your seeds from mine, you are repudiated,' and the wife puts each seed aside, the condition of repudiation is not fulfilled, and the marriage remains intact, unless the husband wishes her to indicate which seeds are hers. When a woman has a date in her mouth and her husband repudiates her on condition that she swallows it and then changes his mind and makes it depend on her spitting it out and then changes his mind again and makes the repudiation depend on her taking the date in the hollow of her hand and the woman on hearing these words quickly swallows half the date and spits out the other half, the condition is not considered to be fulfilled." (Zwemer, Place of Woman in Islam, p. 202.)

Finally the male preeminence is not to be sought in social distinctions which degrade the wife to the level of virtual serfdom. That much-storied courtier of the Middle Ages the Knight of La Tour seeks to impress upon his daughters the servile obedience which a medieval wife owed her husband. One of his narratives features a wife who habitually contradicted her husband in the presence of strangers. His patience exhausted, he finally used his biceps to enforce his authority and broke her nose as he struck her to the ground. The Knight does not take the time to explain or excuse the husband's actions in marring her beauty. Some ancient tombstones in Rome mark the graves of women with muzzles to show that they were not to talk, and with reins to show that they were to be driven. In India, where the annual cost of maintaining some 14,000,000 sacred cattle is estimated at $80,000,000, the wife is accorded much less consideration than one of these pampered cows. She is not permitted to occupy the same quarters as her husband. Instead, Mother India's daughters live in the zenanas, usually so dirty and dismal that a native Indian protests: "I shudder to think about the condition of our mothers and sisters in the harem... From early morn till late at night they are working out the same routine throughout the whole of their lives without a murmur, as if they are patience incarnate. There are many instances where a woman has entered the house of her husband at the time of the marriage and did not leave it until death had carried her away. They are always in harness as if they have no will but only to suffer— suffer without any protest." (Abani Mohan Das Gupta, in K. Mayo's Mother India, p. 122.) Woman's social position in Moslem North Africa is graphically illustrated by this picture from The Moslem World of Today (J.R. Mott, p. 237): "A feast is being held in the stone hut, and the men sit shoulder to shoulder round the wide wooden footstool that serves for table; the bowl of semolina is crowned by a stewed fowl. From this the neck. and claws are thrown to the woman huddled in the corner. That is her legitimate portion. She has fed the chicken with her own scraps; she modeled the bowl with its quaint crisscross of orange and black and red colors pounded from stones that she knows. She has rolled and steamed grain for hours. So be it: she shall have the neck and the claws."

### "EVEN AS CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH"

Christ's Gospel, supported by His own holy example, raises its voice for the new commandment of love to protest against man's barbarity toward woman. Even Renan, skeptic that he was, admits: "Woman never had a religious conscience, a moral individuality, or an opinion of her own previous to Christianity." According to the divine standard the Christian husband, far from condescending to bestow only casual affection upon his wife, must love her with that profound devotion demanded by the apostolic injunction: "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the Church" (Eph. 5:25). When at Calvary, all history's holy of holies, we pause to survey the extent of Christ's devotion to the Church, we bow before a love that came to give rather than to take, to serve instead of being served, a love that loved until the end, that bitter end when, in the greatest sacrifice of which even divine mercy could conceive, Christ died that His Church might live. By the impulse of this divine love the discussion of the term "obey" becomes more academic than actual in any truly Christian marriage. Glorifying Christ, the husband will be impelled to cherish his wife with an intense affection, to acknowledge her virtues and accomplishments, to minimize her frailties, to perform the many services of love by working for her, providing for her, living for her, and, if necessary, even dying for her, as Christ gave Himself for the Church. This includes of course the less heroic exhibitions of devotion - the daily evidence of love and comradeship expressed in words of endearment and in confidential exchanges of opinion.

Guided by these divine standards, Christian marriages normally develop into congenial lifetime alliances. That is why a young man who stands on the threshold of the matrimonial domain, instead of worrying about the rigid maintenance of his masculine prerogatives, should pray for the help of God so that by the indwelling of His Spirit he may love his wife "even as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself for it." There was more practical truth than exegetical accuracy in the observation of the old interpreters who taught that woman was not created from the head of man, to signify that she was not to rule over him; nor from his feet, to prevent the claim that she was to be a slave; but from his side, to symbolize that she was to be his helpmate and companion.

In St. Paul's time wifehood was degraded beyond the reaches of our modern conception. For this reason he continues to compare a husband's love for his wife with the love of Christ for the Church; he also established another standard to check the sin of selfishness. He continued: "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself" (Eph. 5:28). In these words the apostle made the striking deduction that, since husband and wife are one, the love and consideration extended to the wife must be as intense as the thought and care which the husband bestows upon himself. What a world of practical every-day lessons this verse offers! It challenges husbands to ask themselves whether they lavish generous sums on their own clothing and force their wives to spend a miserable pittance in some bargain basement. It asks them to compare their own expenditures for entertainments and traveling with the recreational expenses incurred by their wives, to put side by side the hours they, the husbands, spend in sports and comfortable ease and the time which their helpmates are permitted to enjoy in parallel pleasures.

When a young woman marries, she takes the name of her husband to signify that she is his, not in any sense of selfish pos-session, but rather in a lifelong association and loving companionship, distinguished by self-denial and conformity to her loved one's wishes. It may sound outmoded and puritanical to tell young people today that this relation should obtain in their marriages. Yet as every disregard of divine ordinance produces the evidence of its own faultiness, so no woman has ever been able to sacrifice her divinely instituted position in marriage without surrendering something noble and feminine. Wherever a young woman, thrilled by the ecstatic realization of a good husband's love, finds her vocation in helping to make life fuller and better for him, - not as his overlord nor as his servile underling, but as his cooperative companion, - this attitude constitutes a key-stone in the arch of fuller marital understanding. It helps lead to the path along which those who would learn more deeply the fine art of living together may walk in rapture.
