## 8.2 CRADLE OR CAREER?

Her children arise up and call her blessed - Prov. 31:28

WHEN Emil Ludwig enumerated the "ten greatest women of history," his selection in general was as far from true womanly greatness as a tomtom ensemble is from a philharmonic orchestra. In his choice of Madame Curie, Florence Nightingale, and perhaps Harriet Beecher Stowe his selections for a Hall of Female Fame may be seconded, although some cannot agree that these should be included in the select coterie of the world's most distinguished ten. But otherwise he has mentioned some who would be barred from the United States on the ground of moral turpitude, and who are irreconcilably opposed to the ideals of clean, happy womanhood.

### THE WORLD'S "GREATEST" WOMEN

As his first choice Ludwig mentions Aspasia. He skilfully portrays her as the brilliant companion of the Athenian statesman Pericles, the antidote to his lawful wife. Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, however, has demonstrated that Aspasia, a loose woman, broke up the family of Pericles, lived with him in illicit relations, and after his death reputedly became the mistress of another Athenian. That she was Pericles's inspiration and his political counselor is Ludwig's own view, endorsed otherwise only by the comic poets. Yet there is nothing farcical about the exaltation of this woman who lived without the law; it is stark tragedy. It will be construed by many as a justification of the domestic triangle; it will bring unwarranted sympathy for the husband whose wife "doesn't understand him"; it will lead young women to endorse the "holiness of love outside of marriage," and similar ruinous rot.

Among Ludwig's other "greatest women" is the Marquise de Maintenon. Her claim to this distinction, Ludwig's readers are assured, rests on the self-control, cleverness, and determination through which "she achieved the impossible: the poor girl born in a prison reigned in the palace of Versailles." - This is one side of the story. The other, seamy and sordid, reveals her as an intimate friend of Madame de Montespan, mistress of Louis XIV; and her whole career at court shows that she condoned the foul practices of the polluted French capital. History testifies that, while the legitimate queen lived, Maintenon was the last of a series of Louis's amies. Even her marriage to the philandering king after the queen's death could not set matters straight, because it was a secret arrangement, void of all written proof, in which she was recognized as queen only behind closed doors. To applaud Maintenon is to encourage sinful ambitions among young women who will brook no restriction of law and convention but ride ruthlessly over all moral obstacles.

Ludwig also nominates Elizabeth, queen of England. Her accomplishments, like those of any unusual woman, should be recognized; yet the best that may be said of her is not enough to glorify her as a paragon of feminine accomplishment. Her pronounced masculinity betrayed a notable absence of the finer womanly instincts. If her own age was repeatedly scandalized by her actions, even three centuries of history cannot gloss over her royal inconsistencies.

Catherine of Sienna and Joan of Arc, two more of Ludwig's choice, were unmarried. Why hold up as examples before the young people of America women whose careers offer a studied protest against the blessings of matrimony or acclaim a woman who was first damned by her Church and then blessed by the same body?

To skip over the remaining celebrities in this list of ten female immortals (and Marie Antoinette's participation in the extravagant and dissolute practices of the court society emphatically bar her, while the Italian actress Duse is eliminated because her career lacks the decisive qualities of true greatness), we may conclude in summary that Ludwig has drawn a cartoon instead of painting a charming canvas.

Four of Ludwig's "immortal women" are also selected for a new list of the world's supergreat women. Claiming that 30,000,000,000 people have lived since the beginning of recorded history, that only 5,000 "ever amounted to much," and that only 200 of these 5,000 superdistinguished were women, Dr. Albert Wig-gam, popular syndicate writer, submits his "fifteen greatest women." Writing in Liberty, he says that the following women, judged by the amount of space devoted to their biography in current encyclo-pedias, may be regarded as the preeminent of all history: Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots; Queen Elizabeth of England; Joan of Arc; Madame de Stael, French writer; George Sand, French writer; Queen Catherine II of Russia; Madame de Sevigne, letter-writer; Madame de Maintenon, consort of Louis XIV; Maria Theresa, queen of Hungary; Josephine, wife of Napoleon; Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI; Christina of Sweden; Cleopatra of Egypt; Catherine de Medici, queen of Henry II; Queen Anne of England.

Frankly we are not impressed by this principle of measuring greatness by inches. If encyclopedic space were to be the standard of true value and accomplishment, we should have to conclude that Benedict Arnold was more eminent than Edison; for our edition of the Britannica shows twenty-four and three-quarters inches for Arnold and only four and a half for Edison.

More objectionable, however, is the fact that of these "fifteen finest" only two (Queens Ahne and Maria Theresa) led normal, womanly lives, from the point of view of the Christian home and Christian marriage. Most of the others were brazenly immoral.

### AMERICA'S GREATEST WOMEN

America's twelve most distinguished women were recently selected on the basis of a nation-wide poll, in which more than 128,000 votes were cast. A thousand women were designated "great leaders," but the twelve greatest of these great, named in the order of their choice, were: Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Scientism; Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize; Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross; Frances E. Willard, founder of the World W.C. T.U.; Susan B. Anthony, suffrage leader; Helen Keller, author, who overcame the handicap of being deaf, dumt, and blind; Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of Uncle Tom's Cabin; Julia Ward Howe, poet, patriot, author of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic"; Carrie Chapman Catt, suffrage leader, chairman of the National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War; Amelia Earhart Put-nam, first woman to make a solo flight across the Atlantic; Mary Lyon, founder of Mount Holyoke College; Mary E. Woolley, president of Mount Holyoke College, president of the American Association of University Women.

I have never seen a catalog of feminine distinction that has not selected for its galaxy some whose achievements protest against the highest womanly ideals. With all its noteworthy names this Chicago list is no exception. When measured by the standards of devotion to wifehood, motherhood, and home-life, the list of women enshrined in the Century of Progress hall presents some noteworthy details. Only three of these distinguished women led normal, married lives: Harriet Beecher Stowe, Julia Ward Howe, and Carrie Chapman Catt. Seven of the twelve were never married, and the two remaining "great leaders" had unusual marital careers. Mary Baker Eddy, for instance, was married three times. Her disillusion has expressed itself in an unmistakable rancor, which assails marriage as a purely carnal arrangement.

This indicates a changing ideal. A woman is regarded as preeminent not because she performs those plain duties laid down for Christian women in the Bible, but because, overlooking entirely her home attachments, she attains to distinction in politics, on the stage, by philanthropy, through literary work, in the professions, business, or allied activities.

### "THOU EXCELLEST THEM ALL"

Among 600 representative Americans who nominated 200 different women in a ballot for "the most interesting woman in America" one vote should have attracted nation-wide attention. A solitary individual had the temerity to declare that woman attains her highest ideals when, forsaking the roar of business, the mudslinging of politics, and the clash of other careers, she marries, settles down to make a home, proves herself a helpful wife, and cheerfully assumes the responsibilities and blessings of motherhood. These, we may believe, were the sentiments of the person who, at the end of a formidable list of nominations for the stars of first magnitude in the heavens of femininity, dared to propose as "the most interesting woman in America" none other than "a successful mother."

This nomination should be seconded and the election made unanimous, for "a successful mother" is not only the most interest-ing, but also the most valuable woman in our nation. The youth of our land must think clearly and constructively on the ideal of Christian womanhood and avoid those influences which tend to coax wives and mothers from the family.

The glory of consecrated womanhood is clearly emphasized in the Scriptures, particularly in the closing verses of the ode to godly mothers found in the last chapter of Proverbs. Paying tribute to all the varied accomplishments of women, the author admits: "Many daughters have done virtuously"; but he hands the palm of distinction to a mother, the woman who is first of all concerned about her home, her children. He tells her, "Thou excellest them all."

Human experience likewise pays tribute to Christian mother-lisa Centuries and Anhus resued her son ohn guid the he became one of the most eloquent preachers in the history of the Church, his pulpit oratory earning for him the name Chrysostom, "the Golden-mouthed."

Monica led her wayward son Augustine from debauchery to distinction.

The mother of John Huss accompanied her son all the way to the university in Prague, returning alone as best she could.

"I was born," Sir Isaac Newton writes, "in a home of godliness and dedicated to God in my infancy. I was my mother's only child, and almost her whole employment was the care of my educa-tion." A biographer recalls that "every day of her life she prayed with him as well as for him, and every day she sought to store his mind with those majestic and gracious words that, once memorized, can never be altogether shaken from the mind. It was the grief of her death-bed that she was leaving her boy, a little fellow of seven, at the mercy of a rough world; but she had sown the seed faithfully, and she hoped for a golden harvest."

The mother of Abraham Lincoln was one of the sources of his strength and ambition. He said: "All that I am and all that I hope to be I owe to my angel mother."

On the day of his election Grover Cleveland wrote his brother, the Rev. William N. Cleveland, with this expression of gratitude for maternal guidance, "Do you know if Mother were alive, I would feel so much safer? I have always thought that her prayers had so much to do with my success."

John Wanamaker, merchant prince, acknowledged his indebtedness to his mother's guidance in these words: "My first love was my mother, and my first home was on her breast. My first bed was upon her bosom. Leaning little arms upon her knees, I learned my first prayers. A bright lamp she lit in my soul that never dies down or goes out though the winds and waves of four-score years have swept over me. Sitting in my mother's old atm-chair, which she loved because her first-born son gave it to her forty years ago, I am writing this, with the evening twilight coming on. With the darkness falling, I seem to lose myself in the flood of memories and to feel that the arms of the chair have loosed themselves to become my very own mother's arms around me again, drawing me to her bosom, the happiest place on earth, just as she used to do in the days and nights long gone by. I feel the touch of her little hand on my brow, and I hear her voice as she smooths my hair and calls me her boy, her very own boy."

Michael Pupin, internationally known for his discoveries relative to long-distance telegraphy and telephony, in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor, exalts the guidance of his mother, a Serbian peasant woman; despite her illiteracy she always remained his ideal and directed his course aright even though his father would have planted insurmountable obstacles in the way.

These tributes to motherhood, chosen at random from various ages, illustrate a truth that demands modern reemphasis. Woman's greatness lies not in endurance flights, laboratory achievements, suffrage agitation, prohibition propaganda, professional preemi-nences, and pulpit preaching but in the hallowed devotion to the home. To a larger extent than many of us realize the finest and best attainments of our lives have been reached, under God, by a mother's devoted direction. Our first prayers, the sharpened distinction between right and wrong, the molding of our plastic characters, the predominant emphasis on the good, the true, the beautiful, the avoidance of the catastrophes of sin, these basic blessings we must attribute largely, under divine blessing, to our mothers and their steadfast devotion to home and family.

### CAREER AFTER MARRIAGE?

One of the opposing influences is the desire for a career after the wedding. This draws an increasing number of women from their homes. The percentage of married women at work in American industries has doubled since 1890, having increased proportionately much faster than the number of having unmarried women employees. According to a study of the United States Census Bureau, in 1920, 8,346,796 women above the age of fifteen were gainfully employed. In 1930 this number rose to 10,632,149, or an increase during the decade of more than 27 per cent. In the same period, however, the employment of married women increased from 1,920,281 to 3,071,302, a growth of 60 per cent.

The Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor, in a survey of four representative cities (Jacksonville, Florida; Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; Butte, Montana; and Pas-saic, New Jersey) found that of the bread-winning women 55 per cent were or had been married; of the married women wage-earners 50 per cent had children.

A study of the 1930 census figures shows that of all women employed in trades, 35.3 per cent were married; in domestic ser-vice, 35 per cent; in manufacturing, 32.4 per cent; of those in clerical work, 18.3 per cent.

The motives behind this away-from-the-home employment after marriage are varied. Economic reverses frequently make it imperative for a wife and mother to assume the role of wage-earner and to assist a husband incapacitated or unable to secure profitable employment. Under these circumstances every Christian wife should willingly shoulder additional responsibility.

Few of us have a real picture of the extent to which American married women are forced to help support their families. The figures compiled recently by'the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and published in The Woman Worker, July, 1939, contain startling information. Investigators visited 25,800 native white families not on relief that were "complete" families, that is, they contained at least both husband and wife, and in 650 of these families the chief wage-earner was the wife. The report concludes that "more than 2,000 wives in the city [Chicago] ... are the sole support" of their families.

Again, there are talented women whose unusual endowments are often drafted by public necessity or welfare. There are those, too, who in spite of the care required for their children can engage in part-time work because they employ extra help. All this is the exceptional; and no one but a bigoted zealot could protest. Even here unhappy extremes can develop, and Mrs. Cora Harris, popular novelist, writing in the Saturday Evening Post, appropriately suggests spinsterhood for female genius that is unwilling to be hampered by home duties: "I am not opposed to the glory and distinctions of world-conscious women, you understand, but the point I make is that they should play fair and remain spinsters. They belong to public life... and should not assume the duties of wives and mothers and homes, for which they have neither the mind nor the time. Some of them will have tall monuments raised to their memory by public subscription; but if I should deserve so much as a marker no taller than the knees of my remains, I hope it will be private and personal to my own life, with a brief legend on it saying whose wife I was and whose mother and referring to me kindly as a somewhat beloved woman."

Many women constantly before the public have sincerely preferred home-life. In the June, 1936, Good Housekeeping magazine, Kirsten Flagstad, Metropolitan Opera soprano, confesses: "While I love my music and deeply appreciate the unbelievable welcome given me here, I do not consider singing my real career. I shall not continue it indefinitely. It is just this knowledge that allows me to go on with it. I look forward to the time when I shall again have the quiet home-life of my early married years.

"Music is my career in the sense that I devote my best efforts to it and try to give satisfaction. It is most definitely not my career in the sense in which a man embraces his career — as the one big interest in his life, that must go on for the sake of his loved ones and never be interrupted. That sort of career is waiting for me at home.

"These, then, are the circumstances under which I believe a married woman can have a career. If she needs to work as my mother did, the question settles itself. But where the career becomes a problem to be argued about, there can be but one possible solution. That solution must grow out of a consideration for the home responsibilities which every wife assumes as a holy obligation the day she marries. I do not say that no married woman should work. But I am old-fashioned enough to believe that the decision must take into account more than merely her own whims and pleasures. The first consideration must be the home, the husband, the family. No married woman has the right to develop herself at their expense. No woman has a right selfishly to deprive a man of the warmth, the care, and the companionship which he is entitled to expect of her."

On the other hand, in cases all too prevalent the wife continues to work after marriage even though her husband earns an ample salary and the income of her independent career is not required for the support of the home. This practice is usually hazardous and frequently destructive to the highest family ideals.

Magistrates who have witnessed the endless succession of domestic tragedies are emphatic in their disapproval of the working-after-marriage idea. Says Supreme Court Justice Dike of Brooklyn: "For wives, business careers are almost invariably antagonistic to domestic duties and having children. The cold calculation of trade chills the warmth of home-life." Justice Southern of Kansas City, in refusing to grant a divorce to a woman secretary of the Kansas Public Service Commission, warns: "Whenever the wife participates actively in politics and in holding public office, she has instituted a régime which is incompatible with domestic relations. It cannot be done. It is just as incompatible as Church and State. Cooperation of Church and State is fatal to government, and the attempted mixture of a public career in politics by a wife is fatal in the home." And Justice Samuel E. Kramer, magistrate in the Common Pleas Court of Cleveland, asserts: "In seventy-five per cent of all divorces which I have granted I find that both husband and wife were working outside the home."

### CHAMPIONS OF WORKING WIVES

Of course, this extradomestic activity for married women has been warmly defended. Katherine Bush, New York novelist, protests: "I think that any girl is foolish to give up her job when she marries. The wives who work are more interesting to their husbands." Divorce statistics contradict this claim; for the normal husbands will be permanently devoted only to a home-loving, home-sustaining wife.

Others find the employment of the wife a cure for the dangerous idleness which marriage sometimes imposes. However, wifehood and motherhood usually leave little time to spare. These responsibilities are so exacting that, even with the most modern equip-ment, time can never drag heavily for a woman who wants to keep her home attractive and meet the obligations which a family imposes. If in our apartment-house world the young matron who presides over a three-room efficiency flat can complete her domestic routine in a few hours, she can utilize the remaining leisure for self-improvement, employment at home, or for charitable and missionary purposes.

Housekeeping, it is further asserted, restricts a woman's freedom and anesthetizes her spirit, while business contacts lead to broader horizons and afford a healthy outlet for the restlessness experienced by many wives. This overstates the opportunities of office duties and minimizes those of home-life. Many women employed in large offices as well as in the highly standardized piece-work system of a factory are victims of a routine so monotonous that even household tasks offer a positive escape. An alert young housewife can regulate her domestic duties so that she will have more time for intellectual or social contacts than the woman tied down to regular office or factory hours. Drastic restrictions will be imposed by the arrival of children; but the new compensation of this added life interest need not rule out wider cultural and social avenues. We hold no brief for those who would chain the modern mother to the kitchen as the household drudge; but experience will show that of two wives of the same age and of similar social and intellectual status, the one a housewife and the other an office worker, the wife who stays home will ordinarily be the more natural, the more experienced in vital human issues.

Another endorsement of employment after the wedding is the repeated assertion that the married woman is frequently a more reliable employee than the single worker. An office manager, interviewed concerning the married women on his pay-roll, claims: "We welcome married women here. They are sometimes better employees than unmarried women. We want women who are settled down, who have reached some serious purpose in life. The married woman more frequently knows what she wants and is willing to work until she gets it. Many unmarried women are not like that; they are searching for something. Married women are more serious in their work.". We find two fundamental errors. First of all, not every single woman is devoid of the power of concentration on her work; and then, the employment of married women may be good for business without being helpful to the home.

Finally, the most frequent argument advanced by working wives is this, that the extra revenue affords the enjoyment of luxuries which a restricted income excludes. This line of reasoning misunderstands the essential purposes of marriage and neglects the apostolic word which lays it upon the conscience of young women "to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own hus-bands, that the Word of God be not blasphemed" (Titus 2:4, 5). Besides, the financial advantages are overestimated. Miss Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor, claimed on the basis of her experience as industrial commissioner of the New York State Department of Labor that, unless a working mother makes more than $3,500 a year, she loses money by her employment. Miss Perkins, herself a married worker, further insists that the financial advantages are not as glamorous as they are often made to appear, for: "The working mother has to pay in many ways for her business freedom, because she has to shoulder unnecessary household expenses, medical attention for her children, and wages for additional servants. Conventional servants do not like to work for women who go to work. They like the women to be home and occasionally chat with them. Many servants leave such an establishment; so the part-time mother is constantly seeking new servants. Shopping is the main occupation of women today, and a good shopper can save much money. The part-time mother is so busy that she must take what the shops give her."

### THE CLASH OF CAREER AND DOMESTIC INTERESTS

As these and other arguments in behalf of the outside employment of married women are weighed in review, the conviction remains that the young bride who ventures out into the sea of matrimony with only half her attention on the compass of happiness need not be surprised if she finds herself drifting about in untried waters or headed toward rocky shores. Nor should the young husband who permits his wife to maintain her former business connections (except for reason of the emergencies noted) complain when he realizes that his dreams of home blessing are not being fulfilled. Employment on the part of the wife makes for separated interests. When a young wife, allowing for extraordinary situations, deserts her home to keep her premarriage posi-tion, her absence can never draw her closer to her husband, solidify her interest in the home, and promote family unity. In a recent monograph published by the United States Census Bureau Dr. Joseph A. Hill, assistant census director, answers the question "Do gainfully employed married women have a normal home-life?" on the basis of a special study conducted in ten cities (Providence, Rochester, Paterson, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City, Atlanta, Louisville, and New Orleans). He finds that 37.6 per cent of the married women engaged in gainful occupations were not living with their husbands in homes of their own. Dr. Hill draws the salient conclusion: "If the normal home-life of a married woman be defined as living with her husband in a home of her own, then somewhat more than one third of these women gainfully employed did not have a normal home-life."

Nor does the employment of the wife, as a rule, operate for the benefit of her husband. The director of the employment bureau in one of the largest business houses in New York City has this to say of the husband of the working wife: "If he is a real man, he will object to having his wife work. If he is not, she deprives him of his ambition; he lets down in his own efforts and is continually willing to allow her to struggle under the whole load of supporting the family." If, as it frequently happens in the curious complexes of our business world, the wife attains to a position which commands a salary larger than the husband's, the danger is ever present that a feeling of superiority, at least subconsciously, may cast its shadow over a wife's estimate of her husband.

Another score against this wide-spread employment of married women is of course the childlessness which it endorses and promotes. Because a working wife is ordinarily unable or unwilling to take care of a baby, married couples often regard it more convenient to postpone the advent of children or to have no children at all. It is a bad bargain, this sacrifice of motherhood for the glamor of a career; and the incriminating practices which it provokes often reap their own ruin.

Even if by means which are sometimes astonishing a wife is able to combine her devotions to both cradle and career, her children are deprived of the full enjoyment of the highest gift within the power of human disposal — a mother's love. A large salary may enable a working mother to employ a nurse for her baby or to give her children unusual educational opportunities. Yet the total of these advantages cannot compensate for the personal care, the sympathetic consideration, the maternal love, for which God created mothers.

Once more Kirsten Flagstad, with well-pointed argument, remarks: "Many women try to justify their being away from home all day by saying that they have a competent maid or governess. This, to my mind, is no argument at all. For, necessary as the actual work of the house is, it is not so important as the atmosphere that pervades the home. And the building of such an atmosphere is the wife's first job. She may be able to hire a maid who cooks better than she does; she may have the most-credentialed governess for her children. But the spirit in her household will be indifferent, mechanical, unless she herself gives out the warmth, the heartiness, and the sense of unity that alone can transform a series of rooms into a home.

"I am sorry for men who sit down to perfect meals that are cooked without personal warmth. I am sorry for little children who pour out their earliest prattlings to nursemaids. A woman who deliberately lets these things happen, for no better reason than her own pleasure, is not playing fair. And no one but the wife herself can give her home the warmth, the confidence, and the all-important desire for a merging closeness which transcends all human values. These things must never be allowed to suffer." (L.c.)

Working wives suffer in other ways. By continually rubbing elbows with the hard-fisted realities of business life, by taking the place of men in the affairs of industry and commerce, by meeting male employers or employees in their own field and often on their own terms, it is inevitable that the finer sensibilities of womanhood are often blunted. True, this confronts even the unmarried woman worker; but through the combination of unfavorable influences already noted it becomes the more serious for the working wife.

Besides, this double duty in factory or office and home cannot promote health. Even the thirty-two or forty hours, to which the new age has humanely reduced the working week of many women employees, plus the energy required to keep up with domestic duties, often impose a heavy mental and physical strain. Meyrick Booth has shown that with the escape from the Victorian home and the participation in the battle called business has come an environment unfavorable to healthy motherhood and an important factor in the appreciable rise of deaths from childbirth within the last twenty years. In an investigation by the Federal Women's Bureau it was found that, when a mother goes to work before the baby is one year old, every fourth child dies (almost double the rate for mothers of the same class who stay at home). The tax which family and business place upon a mother's body and mind cannot be tabulated statistically. Altogether it is one of the chief contributory factors to premature aging, nervous breakdown, and many complications of lingering illnesses.

The employment of wives and mothers is unsound also economically. Married women work for less money than men and consequently often replace male workers. Some enthusiastic proponents of women's work, lobbyists against ordinances designed to regulate working conditions for married women, have been industrialists, eager to exploit this form of cheaper labor. Nor must it be forgotten that in times of financial depression and unemployment many of the married women's positions could well be filled by jobless fathers. The husband of the working wife may hold a lucrative position, while the family of an unemployed wage-earner may be in desperate need. The recognition of this fact has repeatedly prompted business houses during industrial crises to dismiss all married women workers and give their positions to unemployed men. Section 213 of the Economy Act of 1932, which was reenacted in 1936, requires that, when Government departments reduce their forces, married workers who have husbands or wives working in the Government service shall be the first to be laid off and that in classified civil service these married workers shall be the last considered for appointment.

While it is difficult to discover any permanent advantages in the employment of wives when their help is not actually demanded by financial necessity, many dangers are involved in this division of God's ordinances and the divinely established sphere of women's peculiar privileges. Here and there one may find a brilliant woman who somehow or other escapes the conflict between cradle and career; but the welfare of the nation is not fortified by the contribution of exceptions. Domestic prosperity is advanced most permanently by the girl who enters the holy relation of marriage with a heart-deep appreciation of motherhood, with a comprehensive resolution to help build a home, and with the conviction of God's abiding love. That bride not only marches in the front ranks of the most interesting, the most useful, and the most essential women of America, but she is also one of the greatest uplifting forces of the present age.

God give us multiplied millions of such young women!
