## 8.8 THE SECOND MARRIAGE

She is at liberty to be married to whom she will - 1 Cor. 7:39

When before God's altar and in the presence of chosen witnesses a young man and a young woman pledge themselves "until death you do part," the sorrow for which this promise provides seems a remote unreality. The specter of death never recedes so completely as in that happiest of all hours, when love and laughter hold undisputed sway over hearts aglow with radiant hope. Yet, in the far-visioned love of a divine Father who "doeth all things well," it happens too frequently for our human affections that the cold clutch of death intrudes and separates the two partners in pilgrimage on that journey which at the moment of marriage seemed a long, almost interminable, path of perpetually deepening blessings. For an average American couple the bride has six chances in ten of being left a widow, while her husband has four chances in ten of becoming a widower. (Report of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, X, 10: Joint Expectation of Life of Married Couples.) So we have many Orphas and Ruths, young wives bereft of their helpmates in the early years of their marriage, just as there are thousands of young husbands who, crushed in helpless grief, have seen the chill of death silence their youthful brides forever.

In the bitterness of these bereavements Christian courage must express itself. Only deep, unswerving faith in the goodness of God can accept the death of a companion for life as an evidence of Heaven's guidance. However, some brave souls have clearly shown this spiritual mastery. The young clergyman engaged to the sister of the late Sir James Barrie, Scotch novelist, was thrown from a horse and killed three weeks before the day appointed for the wedding. At that time Barrie wrote the following letter to the congregation at Bower, the bereaved parish of the young minister, and asked that it be read from the pulpit:

"To you, at the grave of him who was in three weeks' time to become her husband, my sister sends her love. She has not physical strength to be with you just now in body; but she is with you in spirit, and God is near her, and she is not afraid. You are her loved ones; for it was you who, under God, called him to Bower and gave him the manse to which he was about to bring her; and as he loved you, she loves you. God, who gave His Son for the redemption of the world, has told her that He had need of the disciple's life also and that he died to bring his people of Bower to God's knees. So God chose His own way and took her Jim, her dear young minister, and she says, 'God's will be done'; and she thanks Him for taking away so suddenly only one who was ready to face his Maker without a moment's warning. His great goodness, she says to you, in not taking some one who was unprepared, is her comfort and should be yours. And she prays that Mr. Winter's six months' ministry among you and his death among you while doing his duty has borne, and will continue to bear, good fruit. And me, and will always she will so pray, and she asks you to pray for her. And she says that you are not to grieve for her overmuch, for she is in God's keeping." (J. A. Hammerton, Barrie, the Story of a Genius, page 173.)

The bereaved need the faith which has repeatedly found its heroic expression in the Christian hymnal. Anne Steele experienced one of the hardest aflictions that can come to a woman. Her lover was drowned only a few hours before their wedding-day; yet her faith triumphed, and she could look to Jesus with this resignation:

Give me a calm and thankful heart,
From every murmur free;
The blessings of Thy grace impart
And make me live to Thee.

A Christian mother of five children (one of them suffering with tuberculosis of the hip and ankle) facing the imminent death of her husband through the ravages of tuberculosis of the throat and lungs, writes me: "Our dear father is very near the end of his journey here. Almost any day the Lord Jesus will take him home, where he will no longer have to suffer so terribly and where his poor, tired body will be at rest. It is hard to give him up, for we are both young. He is only forty-three, and I am thirty-four, and we had hoped for many years of life together, working in His vineyard and being with our children; but now we shall all be that much nearer to heaven because he will be there."

It is this faith for which every young husband and wife should pray with increasing fervor; for only in this light can we see light. As the soothing hand of time effaces the sharpness of the wound, it frequently happens that the question of a second marriage presents itself.

In few issues of home-life have opinions run in more crossed directions. Heathen widows have always had but few civil and social rights, and even these have usually been disregarded. Conventions and customs operate to make them the most unfortunate of their down-trodden sex. The suttee, the self-immolation of the Hindu widow on the funeral pyre that consumes her lord husband's remains, has been outlawed by the British; but a writer in Gandhi's Young India (November 11, 1926, cited by Katherine Mayo in Mother India, p. 84) describes the destiny of an Indian relict who has been turned adrift after the death of her husband: "She must live by charity — or by prostitution, into which she not seldom falls. And her dingy, ragged figure, her bristly, shaven head, even though its stubble be white over the haggard face of unhappy age, is often to be seen in temple crowds or in the streets of pilgrimage çities, where sometimes niggard piety doles her a handful of rice. As to remarriage, that in orthodox Hinduism is impossible. ... Whether the widow be an infant and a stranger to the man whose death, she is told, was caused by her sins, or whether she be twenty and of his bed and board, orthodoxy forbids her remarriage."

Nor is the Hindu victimizing of widows coarser than other pagan perversions. In New Guinea a widow must cover her face for half a year after her husband's demise; and every day during this period she must crawl, animal-like, on her hands and knees to his grave. Because her face must be concealed during these pilgrimages to the dead, other women of the tribe lead her with a halter. In Papua custom compels a widow to wear the skull of her departed spouse on a chain around her neck, and this all the days of her life. In other sections of the same island the wearing of the widow's veil, a heavy cloth completely covering the entire head, is so rigorously enforced that any neglect of this ceremonious torture entitles the male kinfolk of the deceased husband to kill the offending widow. In China widows are often driven to suicide, chiefly because the relatives of the husband try to force them into a life of shame. In Nias the widow is frequently sold to another man on the day of her husband's burial. An Associated Press dispatch of June 12, 1933, tells of the discovery of two aboriginal villages on the island of New Britain (part of the Bismarck Archipelago) in which abhorrent rites of widow-slaughter are still ceremonialized. The patrol officer reports that, when one of these Melanesians dies, his widow insists on being strangled so that her liberated spirit may follow her husband into the other world. The account continues: "On some occasions the men, being afraid of consequences, have refused to strangle a woman. Then it sometimes happens that the widow takes off her grass skirt and hands it to the men, telling them to put it on and saying they are only women and not real men. This so shames them that they reluctantly kill her according to custom. The consummation of the ritual is the duty of the widow's brother or her nephews, who wind a native bark cloth around her neck and tighten it until she is choked." So viciously does paganism stigmatize widowhood and ban the possibility of remarriage!

### THE PROTEST OF CHRISTIANITY

This brutality stands in defiant opposition to the sympathetic position of Holy Scripture. In its humane attitude the entire Word of God shows particular consideration for bereaved wives. Passage after passage in the Old Testament forbids the disregard and defrauding of widows (Ex. 22:22; Deut. 14:29; 16:11, 14; 24: 17-21; Is. 1:17; Jer. 7:6; 22:3, and many others). Even the casual Bible-reader will recall the providential support extended to the widow of Zarephath through Elijah. In the New Testament the Savior's "woe" is hurled at the profiteering scribes and Pharisees, who mercilessly "devour widows' houses" (Matt. 23:14). St. Luke is notably concerned with offering these bereft women adequate thought and care; for the writings of the beloved physician contain more references to widowhood than are found in the three other gospels. He tells of the eighty-four-year-old widow Hannah (Luke 2:36 ff.); of the widow of Nain (7:12); the importunate widow (18:3); the widow and her mite (21:2); the neglect of the Grecian widows in the first church (Acts 6:1); Dorcas, the friend of widows (9:39). Toward the end of the New Testament we have the well-known definition of "pure religion and undefiled" by St. James (chap. 1:27), which begins with the admonition "to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction." From the earliest days of the Church widows were therefore attracted to Christianity and were privileged to play a prominent part in the first missionary endeavors.

With the exception of the Old Testament restriction prohibiting the high priest from marrying a widow (Lev. 21:14), the Scriptures recognize the right of remarriage. This principle was endorsed by the example of Ruth, the ancestress of our blessed Lord; it was sanctioned by the Old Testament custom of successive marriages when a brother had left a childless widow (Deut. 25:5 ff. - levirate marriage, part of the Jewish civil law, designed to perpetuate the family name, but of no binding force for us); and it is definitely approved for our age by the sweeping statement of St. Paul: "The wife is bound by the Law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord" (1 Cor. 7:39).

It is sometimes urged, however, that the approval of the great apostle is rather negative evidence, because he adds: "But she [the widow] is happier if she so abide," namely, in her widowhood (v. 40) ; and earlier in the chapter he states: "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I"(v. 8). But this unique section of St. Paul's correspondence must be understood in the light of the remarks with which the great apostle has framed his opinion. For at the beginning of the chapter (v.7), in the words "I speak this by permission and not of commandment"; in the middle (v. 12), in the statement "To the rest speak I, not the Lord"; and at the end (v. 40), in the conclusion "after my judgment," St. Paul emphasizes that he has received no divine revelation on this question but that he is expressing his private conviction, which the Holy Spirit has perpetuated. The apostle expects, as he explicitly states, only those to follow his instruction on this point who have the gift of continence which he enjoys. And the whole chapter must be regarded as presenting a point of view suggested both by the missionary opportunities confronting the Church at that time and by the chaotic conditions surrounding Christian congregations in the era of persecution. For the final verdict of the same apostle is this: "I will therefore that the younger women" (i.e., the widows, as the context shows) "marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully" (1 Tim. 5:14). While the apostle held that some widows could attain to the highest happiness of life in the service of their Savior, he also knew that amid the perilous social problems which would face them the normal course would usually be the less dangerous.

These wide, sympathetic principles of Scripture are altogether beneficial. Here is a young woman whom death has robbed of a devoted husband's love. She is left, as is often the case, without support for her children and without sufficient means for the maintenance of her home. Even if the financial resources are adequate, she faces life bereft of the guiding and stabilizing influence of a helpmate, confronted with the picture of that lonely widowhood which Washington Irving called a "living monument of real grief" and doomed for life to be "bowed down with age and sorrow at the altar of her God, offering up the prayers and praises of a pious, though a broken, heart." While a second marriage may lack some of the romance and intensity of feeling which marked the first, who will not agree that to this woman and her children a second and happy marriage would be a blessing?

### DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES IN REMARRIAGE

That the early Church Fathers did not agree in recommending remarriage is evident from Augustine's "On the Good of Widow-hood" (Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Vol. III, p. 460), where despite evident misgivings he expresses this sweeping summary: "I say to every widow, You will be more blessed if you shall have so continued." About the same time Innocent I castigates the priests who had married widows and insists that the clergy be permitted to take as wives none but virgins.

Remarriage presents some difficulties, it is true. Not the least of these is the danger of comparisons. In the fourteenth century Paloa di Gertaldo penned this pointed paragraph of warning against second marriages (Crump and Jacob, The Legacy of the Middle Ages, p. 424): "If thou wilt never be able to satisfy her, and every time thou refusest her anything she may ask of thee she will say, 'My other husband did not treat me thus!' Yet, truly, if thou hast already had another wife, thou mayest take her with greater safety, and if she saith, 'My other husband did not treat me thus,' or, 'Blessed be the soul of So-and-so,' thou canst reply, Blessed be the soul of Madonna So-and-so, who did not cause me this tribulation every day!'"

Dr. Johnson's indefatigable biographer, Boswell, records a conversation with his distinguished friend that stresses a happier side of this question: "When I censured a gentleman of my acquaintance for marrying a second time, as it showed a disregard of his first wife, he [Johnson] said, 'Not at all, sir. On the contrary, were he not to marry again, it might be concluded that his first wife had given him a disgust to marriage; but by taking a second wife, he pays the highest compliment to the first by showing that she made him so happy as a married man that he wishes to be so a second time?' So ingenious a turn did he give to this delicate question." The sentiments of Gouverneur Morris must have been similar. When that early American statesman died, he left a large fortune to his wife but made the provision in his will that, if she married again, the income was to be doubled.

The second marriage often finds the remarried bride more adept in housekeeping, more experienced in family affairs, and, in general, better prepared to meet the expectations of her new hus-band. It is not surprising therefore that the second marriage of a woman is often more successful than an impartial observer might expect. In England, with its 2,000,000 more women than men, many thousands of pounds sterling have been saved for the pension fund because of the remarriage of war widows. Their appeal as homemakers is definitely stronger than that of many younger women who glory in economic independence.

A second marriage for a man, however, presents a somewhat different aspect. We remember that in the postapostolic Church this union was almost universally forbidden in the case of the clergy. The animosity against clerical remarriage rested upon a strictly literal interpretation of Titus 1:6, where the bishop is required to be "the husband of one wife." While this apostolic ordinance is usually explained as a prohibition of the polygamy prevalent in many sections of the Mediterranean world at that time, this negative attitude toward remarriage of the clergy has survived until the present time in the Greek Catholic Church. It is commonly said of priests' wives in this communion that their position is far more exalted and their treatment much more considerate than that of the wives of the laity, since clerical remarriage is ecclesiastically tabu.

A young father upon whom death has thrust the care of children normally can find help in a second marriage, a course followed by an increasing number of widowers. (Cp. the American Mercury, January, 1931, pp. 46 49, for "Notes on Marriage," in which Prof. Wm. T. Ogburn shows that, while middle-aged widows tend not to remarry, middle-aged widowers do.) But the woman who remarries (or the young woman who marries a widower) must take into prayerful consideration the specter of disheartening associations that sometimes cluster about the word "stepmother." It is difficult to overestimate the actual problems confronting a conscientious young woman who becomes the legal mother of motherless children. The daily contact with little ones to whom she may come as an utter stranger and at best as a considerate friend, the supplanting of the first mother's love in these young hearts, the conquest of inherent prejudices, and the winning of children's confidence are tasks that challenge the highest and best of true woman-liness. That this challenge can be met is proved by those innumerable examples of maternal adaptability in which a Christian stepmother by sacrifice, prayer, character, and self-adaptation has triumphed over these obstacles in a manner which has pleased God and cheered men.

However, if a second marriage unites an elderly widower with a very young woman, they must be prepared for the probability that this marriage will be regarded in a definitely unfavorable light. All uncertainty vanishes, and remarriage is usually condemned even by fair minds, when it is consummated immediately after the burial of the first wife.

In spite of the difficulties besetting those who venture upon the sea of matrimony for a second time, Christians usually have every reason to feel genuinely optimistic about remarriage. In his marital life with the widowed Martha Custis the Father of our Country demonstrated the possibility of making a second marriage notably happy. Two of the other great Americans that illumined the first century of our national life, Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln, came from homes where the father had taken another life-mate after the death of the first. Lincoln's stepmother, Sarah Bush, was noted for her "sprightliness and industry." There is little doubt that the development of young Abraham, who was continually under her care from his tenth to his twenty-fourth year, was remarkably influenced by her sympathetic attitude toward his desire for learning. This statement is credited to her, and investigators of Lincoln lore accept its authenticity: "I induced my husband to permit Abe to read and study at home as well as in school. At first he was not easily reconciled to it, but finally he, too, seemed willing to encourage him to a certain extent. We took particular care not to disturb him and let him read on and on until he quit of his own accord." There might have been no great Emancipator had there been no second marriage in the Lincoln household.

Among other notables who remarried, we recall the brilliant cantor of St. Thomas's, Leipzig, Johann Sebastian Bach; in the domain of science, leaders like Elie Metchnikoff, who was saved from mediocrity, despair, and suicide through a second marriage to an exceptional young woman. From then on, a biographer tells us, "Metchnikoff's life was much less disastrous. His hands began to catch up with his precocious brain; he was learning to do experiments." (Microbe Hunters, by Paul De Kruif, p. 211.)

That great missionary to Burma Adoniram Judson was married three times. Edwin T. Dahlberg (Youth and the Homes of Tomorrow, p. 135) reviews his marital experiences and presents this verdict: "In each instance the marriage proved to be an ideal relationship in every way. It was the greatness of Judson's own soul as well as the nobility of the women he married that made this possible. His daughter-in-law writes of him that he never permitted any day to become commonplace. He was forever pinning little notes for his wife and children on the curtains of the windows or slipping through little messages of endearment from his study or bringing in a bouquet of roses. He was a great man of God with a radiant Christian faith; and when his fortunes were joined to the lives of three lovely women in succession, each of whom was ready to share in the arduous labors and sufferings of his pioneer mission-field, a beautiful home-life resulted in each instance."

### NO DEATH-BED PLEDGES!

With such precedents — and the list is but barely begun by these names — and with the realization that the Scriptures offer no bar against remarriage, the prejudice attached to second matrimonial careers should normally vanish. Frequently a marriage partner demands of the other, especially on a bed of sickness or death, the promise to refrain from remarriage. Even Dr. Johnson admitted the force of this temptation. Boswell recounts: "He [Johnson] owned that he once had almost asked a promise of Mrs. Johnson that she would not marry again, but had checked himself. Indeed, I cannot help thinking that in his case the request would have been unreasonable; for if Mrs. Johnson forgot or thought it no injury to the memory of her first love, the husband of her youth and the father of her children, to make a second marriage, why should she be precluded from a third should she be so inclined? In Johnson's persevering fond appropriation of his Tetty, even after her decease, he seems totally to have overlooked the prior claim of the honest Birmingham trader."

These promises should not be exacted because a pledge of this upon the life kind may lay an unnecessary burden upon the life of a surviving husband or wife and thwart their happiness. Frequently the motive which seeks to exact this promise is based on a misconception of personal relations in the "life of the world to come." Those who oppose remarriage through the fear of divided interest in the next life can find no support in our Lord's answer to the quibbling Sadducees on this point (Matt. 22, 23 ff.; see next chapter).

It is a serious matter, this second marriage. The obvious inferences for all clear-visioned Christians must be these: Led by the guiding hand of God, they must strive to make their first marriage supremely happy. With constant intercession they must regularly invoke the providence of Almighty God against the misfortunes of untimely death and sudden bereavement. And when under the direction of Heaven a second marriage becomes advisable, they implore the divine benediction upon this new relation with that increased earnestness which the peculiar difficulties of the new union dictate.
