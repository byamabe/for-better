## 8.9 THE REUNION IN HEAVEN

What are these which are arrayed in white robes? - Rev. 7:13

When William Booth stood at his wife's grave, his head bowed low by the weight of crushing grief, he spoke these heart-wrung words: "I have never turned from her these forty years for any journeyings on my mission of mercy but I longed to get back and have counted the weeks, days, and hours which should take me again to her side. And now she has gone away for the last time. What, then, is there left for me to do? ... My work plainly is to fill up the weeks, the days, the hours, and cheer my poor heart as I go along with the thought that, when I have served my Christ and my generation according to the will of God, ... then I trust that she will bid me welcome to the skies."

In one of her last letters the widow of Nathaniel Hawthorne penned this ineradicable hope, which became an anchor of comfort in her soul's sorrow: "I have an eternity, thank God, in which to know him more and more, or I should die in despair.'

When Andrew Jackson lay on his death-bed at the Hermitage, surrounded by his children, relatives, and Negro servants, he deliberately spoke this valedictory: "My dear children, do not weep for me. It is true I am going to leave you. I am well aware of my situation; I have suffered much bodily pain, but my sufferings are as nothing compared with that which our blessed Savior endured on that accursed cross that we might all be saved who put our trust in Him." After he had bidden farewell to the members of his family, he spoke once more for nearly a half hour concerning their soul's salvation and concluded, as his eyes lingered on the portrait of his beloved wife, Rachel, whom he had mourned for many years: "My dear children and friends and servants, I hope and trust to meet you all in heaven, both white and black." He paused and repeated: "Both white and black."

John Newton was attached to his wife with deep affection, for she had repeatedly helped him cling to the faith. However, when death took her, he asked God for added strength, and his prayer was answered. He preached his wife's funeral sermon, choosing as his text the words of Hab. 3:18, "I will rejoice in the Lord." Years later he stated that, although his departed wife had not been out of his thought for five minutes since her death, he had not suffered an uncomfortable day since her home-going. He had gone his way resolutely, anticipating a happy reunion with his beloved.

During the Christmas season of 1874, when Charles Kingsley, widely beloved preacher at Westminster Abbey, was told that there was no cure for his wife's illness, he declared that his "own death-warrant was signed with these words." Yet, in the words of a biographer (Charles Kingsley; His Letters and Memories of His Life; edited by his wife, Vol. II, pp. 333 ff.), "his ministrations in the sick-room showed the intensity of his own faith as he strengthened the weak, encouraged the fearful, and in the light of the Cross of Christ and the love of God spoke of an eternal reunion and the indestructibility of that ... love which, if genuine, can seem to be severed only for a brief moment.... 'But,' he added, it is not darkness you are going to, for God is Light. It is not lonely, for Christ is with you. It is not an unknown country, for Christ is there.' And when the dreary interval before reunion was mentioned, he spoke of the possibility of all consciousness of time being so destroyed that what would be long years to the survivor might be only a moment to the separated soul that had passed over the River of Death."

Another widely known British preacher, the late John Clifford, wrote these lines to a friend on the afternoon of his wife's death: "For fifty-seven years and a half we have lived one life, one in love, one in devotion to the Church of Christ, one in faith and hope, and we shall be one in the heaven of the Great Beyond. Since February 27, 1860, we have been one, wholly one, inseparably one; and though her dear body lies still in the next room, her face lovely in the calm of death, yet our unity is real and abiding — fifty-seven years and a half of ever-increasing love and trust and joy."

In answer to a questionnaire concerning the scientific evidence that the human soul exists after death, Dr. W. W. Keen of Philadelphia recently wrote: "I am fully convinced that, when I pass from this world, I shall meet my dear wife, who was taken from me forty years ago last July, and I thank God for that belief. I thank God for faith as well as science."

Now, are these hopes of a heavenly reunion well founded? Is this earnest expectation that bereaved Christians have confidently voiced in the aching, breaking pain of parting a delusion or deathless truth? Will we meet with

... raptured greetings
On Canaan's happy shore?

Is it true that, when

...knitting severed friendships up
Where partings are no more,
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle
That brimmed with tears of late, —
Orphans no longer fatherless,
Nor widows desolate?

### ETERNITY - NO NIRVANA

The Christian believes with an unalterable conviction and inner persuasion that immortality is a fact, an inviolable verity, mysterious and transcendental, yet as real and personal as every pledge of Christ. He believes that in the resurrection, assured by His Savior's Easter victory over death, individual identity is not submerged. To him the future existence is no semiconscious Nirvana.

This hope is not merely a pious wish; nor does it rest upon the universal belief of men through the ages. It is true that with the exception of agnostic doubt and atheistic dissent men have consistently clung to the conviction that in their future Elysium, no matter with what lines they may draw their picture of the here-after, the departed will recognize each other. Blind pagans sacrificed the widows of their departed leaders on imperial funeral pyres so that these might accompany their deceased husbands into the society of the next life. Cultured heathen like Socrates and Cicero draw the picture of life after death with the consoling reflection that it will bring them the privilege of conversing with other great minds. Disillusioned Stoics have committed suicide in the fervent belief that this act would reestablish broken contacts and reunite them with their deceased friends. All this, amplify it as we will, does not guarantee the Christian an answer to that plaintive query asked by every heart in the bitterness of bereavement, Will we know each other in heaven? Will we be gathered together there with our dear ones? Is it true that -

The loved and parted here below
Meet ne'er to part again?

### THE COMFORT OF THE SCRIPTURES

These eternal expectancies of God's children radiant in the gems of the Church's treasured hymnody and chiseled into the marble memorials that Christian devotion has erected on God's acre, rest upon the statements of that Word which is to be a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path, even when reason deserts us.

The Scriptures assume this truth and would have God's children accept it as granted. The Bible never denies this hope; it never argues it; but it does present a long list of testimonies which point straight to the joy of reunion in heaven.

According to the promise of our Savior the personal identities are preserved in the next world. He tells us that in consequence of the Church's missionary work "many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 8:11). If this passage is to be understood in its original force and meaning, it must be interpreted as presupposing that the three patriarchs are personal entities and are recognized in the realms of eternity.

With impressive clarity we see the evidence of personal recognition on the Mount of Transfiguration, when the disciples without previous instructions immediately recognize the two departed prophets Moses and Elijah (Matt. 17:3). If these commanding figures of the Old Testament could be identified by the disciples who had never before seen them, then in heaven, where our knowledge shall be made perfect and our vision clarified, there must be similar recognition.

The questions of the elder in the Apocalypse: "What are these which are arrayed in white robes? And whence come they?" and their answer: "These are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Rev. 7:13) cannot be correctly interpreted in any other way that by assuming that these saints in glory are recognized as martyrs who have laid down their lives for the glorification of Christ.

Endorsing this truth, the apostle writes to his Thessalonians and, asking: "What is our hope, our joy, our crown of rejoicing?" answers: "Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? For ye are our glory and crown" (1 Thess. 2: 19, 20). Here St. Paul openly declares that he will rejoice in eternity over his converts from Thessalonica, whom he will recognize in the presence of his Savior. The promise holds little comfort unless it predicates personal identity.

A similar conviction animated the believers of the Old Testa-ment. When one of God's heroes in the Old Covenant days passed into eternity, the records tell us he was gathered unto his people. Scoffing Bible critics may interpret this as a reference to the family tomb; but there is no evidence that family crypts were in general use. If the doctrine of the resurrection is so clear and vivid in the Old Testament faith that palsied Job can break through the cynicism of his counselors and declare: "I know that my Redeemer liveth, ... and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another" (Job 19:25-27), how can there be any desire to restrict the implications of this "being gathered unto the fathers" to the sepulchral rest in the family mausoleum? Must we not believe that, when David, tormented over the death of his child, declared: "I shall go to him" (2 Sam. 12:23), he who foresaw the resurrection of Christ, believed that death would reunite him with his infant son?

It is noteworthy that, when the Savior describes the heavens of glory, He adapts Himself both to the limitations of human speech as well as to the inadequacy of the human mind. Nevertheless He speaks of His Father's house with its many mansions, where each of the believers finds the prepared place after the race of life has run its course. This blessed home is not an abode of indefinable spirits that have submerged or lost their personality; it would be unwarranted to picture these heavenly mansions and the celestial communion of the saints without believing in the mutual and individual recognition of the children of God for whom these everlasting dwellings have been prepared by Christ.

With the additional emphasis that the Word of God lays upon the individual in eternity, the names of the elect recorded in the Book of Life, the acknowledgment of each faithful believer by the Savior Himself before His Father in heaven, Dives beholding Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom, no doubt remains in the Christian's mind. He believes that, when the New Testament speaks of "the whole family in heaven" (Eph. 3:15), it includes in this vast picture of the ten thousand times ten thousand the recognition of those who were united in the Spirit-blessed family here on earth.

### "AS THE ANGELS OF GOD IN HEAVEN"

Yet it is no materialistic heaven that reunites the Christian family. Lord Northcliffe is reported to have sent spirit messages to Miss Louise Owen, who for twenty years served as his private secretary. In these "celestial" revelations the "spirit" of the British publisher and war enthusiast allegedly gave the world these instructions through his amanuensis: "Tell them how one faces the music over here; no hush, no secrecy, no hiding behind others. Tell them that this side is full of regrets and remorse for wasted oppotunities. Tell them we are all working cooperatively over here to bring peace and understanding." The editor's "spirit" also declared that, when Miss Owen was on the lecture platform bringing his message to the British people, he would be at her side. As other who were said to be working in close harmony with him he mentioned Bonar Law, formerly Tory premier of Great Britain; Keir Hardie, the first Labor-Socialist member of the House of Commons; Lord Kitchener; and Sir Henry Wilson, some of whom had been vehemently opposed to Lord Northcliffe during the war.

The mystic Emanuel Swedenborg draws a materialistic picture of marriage in the hereafter with wedding-feasts and sharp social differentiation. He writes: "I have also been permitted to see how marriages are contracted in the heavens. As everywhere, in heaven those who are alike are united, and those who are unlike are separated, so every society in heaven consists of those who are alike. Like are brought to like, not by themselves but by the Lord; and in like manner consorts whose minds can be joined into one are drawn together; and consequently at first sight they inmostly love each other and see themselves to be consorts and enter into marriage. For this reason all marriages in heaven are from the Lord alone. They have also marriage-feasts, and these are attended by many; but the festivities differ in different societies." (Sec. 383, "Marriages in Heaven," in Heaven and Its Wonders and Hell.)

The late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in picturing his "Summer-land," the higher plane of a future existence, declares more pointedly that marriage will exist in the hereafter just as on earth but "in less gross form," whatever that is. No children will be born in this spirit world, and there can be no unsuccessful marriages. Men who have been happily married on earth renew their marital alliance in the hereafter, while the unhappily married never meet again. (New York World, April 11, 1922.)

These modern counterparts to a Moslem paradise run counter to the plain pronouncements of Christ. When the Sadducees, who scoffed at the idea of the resurrection, put the catch-question to Him concerning the woman who had married the seven brothers: "In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?" the Savior answers: "Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage" (Matt. 22:28 ff.).

This revelation of Christ has been regarded with mixed feelings and interpreted with mutually exclusive meanings. Some have believed that the Savior's words preclude only the making of new marriages, so that those who were single while on earth will remain unmarried in heaven, while the family relationships continue. Others have veered to the opposite extreme and have been disturbed by the foreboding fear that husbands and wives will be oblivious of one another in eternity.

In this contradiction we must find the key to the explanation in Christ's supplementary statement. They, the blessed departed, He tells us, "are as the angels of God in heaven." When His words "They neither marry nor are given in marriage" are viewed in this light, they signify only that in heaven human marriage with its limitations and earth-bound restrictions will stop and give way to a higher spiritual life and to an angel-like existence. Not a syllable either directly or by inference implies that a Christian husband and wife or believing parents and their children will not recognize one another. We are simply told that in the sublimity of heaven, marriage as we know it now will no longer exist. Let us not speculate where Scripture has not spoken. We are utterly incapable of understanding "the glory that shall be revealed in us." In the absence of any contrary indication may not the Christian, knowing the increasing of joy and the immeasurable endowment of happiness that awaits him when he beholds his Savior face to face, believe that his relations with his beloved, hallowed by the new holiness, will be spiritualized in the beauty of the celestial glories?

### THE APPEAL OF HEAVENLY REUNION

This picture of eternity with our loved ones and the greater company of saints of all lands and ages, a beatified existence without suffering, disappointment, pain, or sorrow, directs its insistent appeal to our Christian families. It pleads for personal piety and that faith without which no man can see God. It asks us individually to weigh with exacting care every thought and word that involves our everlasting destiny. Family connections alone admit no one into heaven. An unbelieving husband may have his religion written in his wife's name while on earth; but when he crosses the bar, he will find that his own name must be written in the Book of Life. An indifferent mother may send her children to Sunday-school while she herself remains away from the church; but her children's faith will not rise up to claim for her the title to a heavenly mansion.

A heart-breaking thought on our earthly pilgrimage is the very suggestion of the possibility that those loved ones who are nearest and dearest to us here may be eternally separated from us hereafter because of unbelief and wilful neglect of their Savior's love. Let impetuous, head-strong youth realize the overpowering importance of Christian oneness in faith and understand that, if two cannot walk together in Christian devotion on their earthly pilgrimage, they cannot enter heaven together.

This prospect of mutually shared glory must also stimulate within us a holy desire to make our earthly homes symbols of our heavenly dwellings and our family life here under the cross of afliction a constant preparation for life with the united family in heaven under the crown of exaltation. Christian husbands and wives who know the blessings of eternity will concede that the few years of this earthly sojourn are too fleeting and precious to be marred by bickering, self-assertiveness, and aloofness. With their eyes steadfastly focused on the heavenly homeland, they will rather endeavor to bring their own marital lives under the foregleam of this radiant eternity and hallow their relationship by sacrifice, forbearance, and self-effacing love. To them the three or four decades which constitute the average span of married life will be but a short period of preparation for the never-ending fellowship with "the whole family in heaven," a prelude, weak and wavering though it may be, to the hallelujah chorus sung by the white-robed saints before the throne of the Lamb.

What more powerful antidote to the crushing sorrows of bereavement than this firmly founded faith in a better life to come and an everlasting companionship that can never be severed by disease or death? What more soothing comfort than to know that

...when man's dearest dies, 'tis then he goes
To that old balm that heals the centuries' woes;
Then Christ's own cry in all the streets is rife:
"I am the Resurrection and the Life"?

What brighter light of illumination by which to dispel the clouds of death's anguish than the radiance of Christ's blood-sealed promise that, when our bodies, sown in corruption, are raised in incorrup-tion, we shall stand glorified at our Savior's side, -

There where the good and blest,
Those we love most and best,
And where we, too, shall rest! -
Heaven is our home.
