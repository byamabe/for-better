## FAMILY FINANCES

There is.. oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. - Prov. 21:20

On a high hill near the center of Toronto one of the most palatial residences ever erected by man rears its crenelated turrets. Some conception of its grandeur may be derived from the fact that this mansion contains fifty rooms and almost as many baths, a library with accommodations for 500 people, three bowling-alleys, a gym-nasium, a conservatory seating 3,000 guests, and other features too numerous to detail here, but all proportionately immense and luxurious. With three bronze doors that cost $14,000 each, a domed stable that represents an outlay of $200,000, the figure given for the entire cost of the castle and its furnishings, $2,000,000, may be regarded as conservative.

By a combination of irony and tragedy this regal structure is empty; its 800 windows are shuttered against the sunlight, and specterlike, cloths cover the floor, walls, and furnishings. For Sir Henry Pellatt, the builder and owner, who became a broker at the age of fifteen and later rose to a commanding position in Canadian fairs, put about all the money he had it the construction of this gorgeous home. Instead of happiness it brought him financial disaster, and the magnificent estate, which was called "Casa Loma," now bears the popular title "Pellatt's Folly."

This is a graphic, if isolated, example of domestic disasters provoked by mistakes in household finances. A study involving 1,000 families in Boston showed that in more than half of these homes friction originated from thoughtless or selfish attitudes toward money on the part of either husband or wife, or both. Another investigation, conducted by Dr. Donald A. Laird, revealed that even in notable American homes a specific cause for discord is often found in financial matters. Through the cooperation of the married men and women in Who's Who in America a cross-section of the higher strata of American life was secured, since only one in approximately 4,000 Americans is included in this "biographical dictionary of notable living men and women." While the families thus interrogated were economically stable and in no particular danger of meeting financial disaster, it was found that of those answering half of the men and a slightly smaller percentage of the women listed money quarrels as a major cause for domestic discord.

### INCREASED LEVIES ON THE HOUSEHOLD TREASURY

Obvious factors have combined to complicate these money problems and to raise the cost of maintaining a modern family. Unknown a generation ago, several new expenditures have been foisted upon us by the higher standards of living during the last third of a century. Every advance in culture brings a parallel demand for the enjoyment of the attractive and the artistic. With an increasing appreciation of art, music, literature, a higher plane of living is created. Our American homes are, on the average, the most attractive in the nation's history. Our radios and musical instruments, our books and magazines, our rugs and draperies, our furniture and home equipment in general, — all these, even in the more modest homes, are evidence of a standard of living completely dazzling to the poverty-stricken people of the Old World. This necessarily imposes heavier drains on the family exchequer.

Radical changes in food supply requiring increased outlay have occurred even within the memory of many readers. We recall, not altogether without a pang of regret, the biweekly baking, the back-yard vegetable garden, the fruit-cellar with row upon row of canned vegetables and preserves. Now we have scientifically baked bread, cut for our tables. We find it easier to purchase vegetables from the huckster or at the corner grocery than to fight against the unequal odds of city gardening. We have torn down the preserve closet to make way for the oil-burner. But all this raises the family budget.

Modern marketing and transportation have worked dietary wonders in the American bill of fare. It is not long since the first fresh green vegetables came into Mid-Western homes shortly before Maundy Thursday or soon after the arrival of spring; now. one can have strawberries in January and Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, watercress, and broccoli the year round. The shipments of fresh fish, oysters, and sea food from the coast to inland States; the fast fruit express transporting the golden yield of California and Florida orchards to our tables; the refrigerator cars distributing Wisconsin's dairy products to localities almost a thousand miles away, these are typical achievements in rapid food delivery attained during our lifetime. But, again, these are achievements for which the consumer pays.

In addition, we have put the comforts and conveniences of home-life into the category of necessities. Our plumbing, heating systems, labor-saving and time-saving devices, electric kitchens, and lavish baths not only add to the ease of life but also increase the original cost and maintenance of a home. Some one has estimated that a century ago the average American had seventy-two wants, sixteen of which were classified as necessities. Today, we are told, the average man must answer the appeal of 484 wants, of which ninety-four are regarded as necessities. Life today embraces many complexities, and complexities, in turn, always involve expenditures. The simple life with its plain economic basis, its home-made food and hand-made clothing, its humble demands and generally unpretentious atmosphere, has passed on in the parade of progress and has bequeathed us an easier but more expensive mode of life.

### AGENCIES OF FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENT

A taxing drain on many American families is the headless obsession of living beyond one's means, that chains the wage-earners to an endless treadmill. This spirit of squandering is one of the predominant sins of the day and has pervaded even our home environment, particularly in the form of that mortgage on income conventionally known as the instalment plan. A public benefactor would be the inventor who could suggest some invisible coat of mail to frustrate the glib attacks of that practical psychologist, the overambitious salesman. Professionally trained in the art of breaking customer resistance, his merciless attack on the family income is launched regardless of all consequences. The confessions of an automobile dealer recorded by Harper's Magazine plainly describe the sales methods employed in disposing of a car to a young father who had no definite need for the machine and whose income would hardly warrant its up-keep. "It wasn't our business," the dealer admits, "whether the young fellow had use for a car or not; the main thing was that he had $200 in cash." In the sequel to this sale we are told that the purchaser could never make another payment; he died, leaving his family destitute.

We can compute the amount which the American homes lose through burglary and theft or through fraudulent investments and blue-sky stocks, but we shudder when we think of the total loss incurred by thoughtless, needless expenditures. If all the evidence of the senseless• spending, could be extracted from our American homes: the electric belts and quasi-scientific medical apparatus; the plaster-of-Paris monstrosities in the form of highly colored kewpies, Charlie McCarthy and Popeye dolls; the dust-catching paper flowers and the pajama dolls with knotted limbs; the millions-now-living-will-never-die literature; the correspondence courses on coconut painting, oratory overnight, Chopin in ten les-sons; in short, if all the numberless items in America's senseless spending orgy could be redeemed for the original purchase price, the funds restored to our family treasuries would be more than enough to offset the results of a depression. Statistical sleuths would be able to tell us that, if every dollar thus saved were placed side by side, this financial belt would stretch from Poverty Flats, Ohio, to Wealthy, Michigan.

Even more hazardous is the allurement of installment buying. Under the magic slogans of "Easily Extended Credit" or "A Little Down and a Little Every Month" the husband's salary is often garnisheed for many years to come. The initial payments may seem small individually, but in their aggregate, swollen by usurious in-terest, they soon assume depressing proportions. A reliable motto for all young married couples is: "Never purchase anything unless you can pay cash"; for this principle, if conscientiously followed, eliminates the difficulties and the regret which the relentless demands of credit purchasing entail. Instalment buying is the most expensive form of purchase. Those who buy on this deferred-payment plan pay from 6 to 16 per cent more than those who pay cash, since the installment seller must protect himself against loss in consequence of refusal to pay, repossession and resale. He must add carrying charges and routine expenses unknown in cash transactions.

Despite this excessive cost young people often indulge in a spending spree, forgetting that under the installment plan they must pay and pay and pay. H. A. Gibans, credit manager of a Milwaukee department store, has watched thousands of newly-weds start their married life and has observed that the roseate expectations of romances have often been shattered on the rocks of indebtedness. He declares: "The average young people blindly plunge into serious debts without the slightest idea of how the bills eventually will be paid. Young couples usually want all the advantages and luxuries that they enjoyed in the homes of their parents. If they start without savings, it can't be done. Too often a young couple will come to the store for more than $1,000 worth of furniture. Perhaps both are working, and they believe they can pay $50 a month. That double income is the most dangerous thing in the world to figure on. We always try to figure on the man's income, for experience has taught us that this is the only safe way. The woman may become sick; or there may be a baby, and the mother would have to give up her job. There are many ways by which the couple is reduced to a single income. Of course, some of them, if they are made of sterner stuff and good fortune is with them, clear themselves of indebtedness and in four or five years have paid off what they owe. But there are lots of others who find that they are not able to deny themselves many things they were accustomed to; and when they pay one bill, they make another. Heavy debts are almost certain to cause discontent when they drag on continually, and too often they lead to broken homes and divorce."

Under pressure of unfavorable circumstances it may become necessary to make instalment purchases as a last resort. In this extremity several precautions should be observed. First of all, never deal with any other than high-grade, first-class concerns. Beware of lurid advertisements, fictitious fire sales, and fraudulent bankrupt stocks. Be sure that a separate contract is drawn up for each item purchased. If the furnishings of the entire house are bought under one contract and the young couple is unable to maintain the terms (which always appear more exacting a year after the sale), the entire furnishings may be "repossessed." Even if $600 or $700 has been paid on a $1,000 purchase, it is possible under the one-contract plan to lose the entire $1,000 worth of goods. If, how-ever, a separate obligation has been made for each item, only those articles on which payments lapse may be taken.

An investigator of installment purchasing issues this further warning: "Another favorite trick of some installment houses which is to be guarded against is that, when the final payment is about to be made on items bought, the salesman will try to induce the customer to buy some additional things and will say: "We do not have to make out a new contract; we will just add to the old one.' Then, if the payments are not kept up on the new items bought, all the old items can be "repossessed" because of the one contract covering everything. The legal-aid societies of the country are working overtime straightening out difficulties caused in just this way. As much care and caution must be taken in signing an installment contract as in the case of any other mortgage. An installment contract is a chattel mortgage and has the same force as a mortgage on the home. The only difference is that it covers specific items, whereas the real-estate mortgage covers ground and buildings." (Harold Holt, Building Family Foundations, pp. 30, 31.)

Only one phase of our financial difficulties is more dangerous than an installment purchase, and that is the usurious small-loan business. Lending-offices, which dot the map of our country, extend loans in such a large aggregate that their business is now the fourth in volume in the United States. Their legal interest rates run from 12 to 45 per cent annually. Without-the-law methods often sky-rocket this rate. It has been shown, for example, that Iowans during 1931 borrowed $2,000,000 in small loans and paid $2,400,000 in interest, a rate of 120 per cent. — To counteract this ruthless usury, thousands of credit unions have been organized throughout the land.

### A NEW ERA WITH FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENT

Prospective brides and grooms who have witnessed the transition from dollars to doles must be ready to adjust themselves. They should save themselves the torment of endeavoring to attain the unattainable, of raising, like Tantalus, their clutching hands for the everlastingly elusive. Accommodating themselves to the limits of a lesser luxury, they will find that, though the new domestic régime may sometimes demand a rigorous simplicity, these restrictions are often character-building.

Self-denial will be required in frustrating the tendency to live beyond the income. An automobile may be a much-desired addition to the convenience and pleasure of a family; but when its purchase and the expense of maintenance absorb the entire financial sur-plus, and when even a middle-priced car entails an outlay of at least forty dollars a month for operation, maintenance, deterioration, insurance, loss of interest, it becomes evident that for a husband with a salary of $150 and with other normal expenses an auto is a prohibitive luxury.

The keep-up-with-the-neighbors complex must vanish if we are to return to healthy home normalcy. The young matron whose eyes linger on the wraps of mink and the fulsome wardrobe of others in her social set must learn to resign herself to the lower level of the fur-trimmed cloth. The family across the street may banish the icy chills of February mornings by the magic of the thermostat; but if the domestic pocketbook cannot be stretched to provide the luxury of self-regulating gas heat, we must accept the anthracite and the furnace chores, not in a spirit of protest but with the optimism that gratefully recognizes how much more uncomfortable the situation might be.

Particularly during the ten years from twenty-five to thirty-five should thrift and cautious expenditure assert themselves. During this decade, well called the "age of accumulation," more houses are built, more babies come into the world, and more goods are purchased than in any other corresponding period of life. The concentration of buying in this ten-year bracket, when newly established families are acquiring their equipment, brings an underscored appeal for careful financial outlay.

If our arrested prosperity will help to reestablish sanity in home-life by persuading Americans to eat simpler and better food, to find health in the exercise of walking rather than obesity in the comfort of motoring, to stay at home instead of swelling the away-from-the-hearth movement, to rise up against the capricious dictates of commercialized fashion, and in general to live and act with the rationality demanded by our well-being and dictated by individual financial limitations, then the depression cloud will indeed have a silver lining.

### BUDGET BLESSINGS

Money reserves would be increased and family friction reduced if even a fraction of the effort devoted to the acquisition of money were directed toward the very a-b-c of its release. An inflexible budget may not be a blessing, but there should be some method of proportionate distribution by which the household income can be administered effectively. An adaptable, elastic budget of expenses, one which takes into consideration the personnel of the individual family and which serves as a guide rather than a dictator, will operate with encouraging results. Indeed, the claim has been made that "the family which budgets its expenditures is getting at least 25 per cent more use of its income than one which does not know where or how the money goes and operates only on impulse."

In a survey published by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company we find these significant cases of stabilized finance, which are eloquent testimonies to the advantages of systematic household operations:

"A budget quickly locates the leaks. Some of us were buying candy, having clothes pressed, and getting shoe-shines. The budget is the only means of knowing how much we may spend for something we want without having to do without something we want more." (C. B., Indiana.)

"At the end of five years of married life we were without any savings. At the end of ten years, with four children in the family, we have a $6,000 home, thanks to the budget plan." (L. T. K., Illinois.)

"For several years I refused to bother with a budget, thinking, as many other women have done, that we could not possibly live more economically; but after using the budget system, I discovered that, while our expenses remained the same, our comforts increased.

"The budget has taught me to serve nourishing, simple, well-cooked food. It has taught me that home dressmaking is not only a necessity, but a pleasure and an art. We spend $39 a month on food, $40 on shelter, $24.40 on clothing, $21.50 on operating expenses, $21 on development, and $20.60 on insurance — total, $166.50. (N. R. C., Colorado.)

"For two years my husband received $250 a month. But beginning with the new year, his salary was reduced to $200. We had never kept a budget as there had always been enough money to buy the things we had to have, with sometimes a little over to add to our savings account. I found that in December our expenses were $247.26, $47.26 more than we would have to spend in the following month. Plainly something had to be done, and we did it. We rearranged our budget by cutting down on operating expenses, saving on light and eliminating laundry bills. The groceries were reduced about $10. I baked our bread for the first time in years. I feel no worse physically for my effort, and mentally I feel quite exhilarated. It was a jolt, but it knocked us out of a rut. My husband and I both feel that the financial loss is only temporary, but we hope our ability to live within a stated income is not temporary." (H. C.M., Oklahoma.)

Sample budgets may be secured from insurance companies, banks, and department stores. These should be adapted to the particular needs of the family and then followed conscientiously. While the various professions and occupations make an absolute, rigid and uniform distribution of funds for all families impossible, the following items of expenditure should be found in every household budget: Shelter (either rent or the payment of mortgage, interest, up-keep, etc., 15—20 per cent; food, 20-25 per cent; clothing (including purchase, cleaning, and repairs), 15 per cent; household operation including gas, electricity, telephone, laundry, supplies, etc.), 9—10 per cent; health and recreation (vacation, entertainment), 5 per cent; taxes and insurance, 5 per cent; mental advancements (including books, magazines, lectures, school), 5 per cent; savings, 10 per cent; church and charitable contributions and gifts, 10 per cent.

The last two items call for further emphasis. In meeting the requirement for systematic thrift, a good rule requires that as a minimum 10 per cent of the family income be deposited regularly in a reliable bank. The iron and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie said that the foundation of his large fortune was laid through the habit he started when as a young man he resolved to save one dollar out of every five earned

Of course, emergencies will arise in which the 10-per-cent savings program cannot be maintained; but where the will to win is marked by the willingness to sacrifice some items in the long catalog of non-essentials, this thrift program, under divine blessing, will become a reality.

Financial irresponsibility is attacked in the Scriptures. With all his almost fabulous wealth Solomon has immortalized some very workable principles for the maintenance of economic soundness in the home. When he writes, "He that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough" (Prov. 28:19), we cannot dismiss his words without thinking of the modern parade of vanity promoted by extravagance. When he warns, "Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well to thy herds, for riches are not forever" (Prov. 27:23), the insanitv of America's speculation craze looms up before us with its neglect of hard labor and its will-o'-the-wisp of easy money. When he summarizes: "There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man spendeth it up," he explains the Damocles sword of debts and duns over improvident families.

The other item on our Christian family budget which distinguishes it from the usual run of planned finance is the provision for a ten-per-cent contribution to Church and charity. Proportionately few Christian homes maintain this high percentage; and it is in no spirit of legalism and in no desire to enforce the Old Testament tithe that it is suggested here. If "God loveth a cheerful giver" (2 Cor. 9:7), particular affection must be bestowed upon a home in which liberal gifts for the Kingdom show a proper recognition of His many blessings. The family that curtails its church contributions and Christian charity to a small fraction of its expenditure for amusements, clothing, and personal adornments will inevitably find, unless the gracious forbearance of God intervenes, that such half-hearted, trivial gifts restrict the bestowal of blessings. On the other hand, the young husband and wife who from the wedding-day lay aside a definite and liberal sum for their Savior and their fellow-men (it may be more than 10 per cent in prosperous homes) will find in this generous stewardship one of their greatest assets. Offerings brought in a spirit of gratitude to God for His unspeakable Gift bear out the apostle's promise, "He which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully" (2 Cor. 9:6). This generous harvest may not always be computed in terms of human success; but there is a spiritual ingathering, precious beyond all price, to be reaped both in time and in eternity by those who share their prosperity with God. Not the least of these blessings can be the contentment of a Christian home, the love binding Christian parents to Christian children, and the radiant immanence of the redeeming Christ.

### PARTNERS IN FAMILY FINANCE

In the happy comradeship of a marriage hallowed by Christian devotion the problems and opportunities of family finances are met by cooperative partnership. Probably one of the most provocative causes of domestic troubles is the niggardly refusal of the husband to supply adequate support for the maintenance of the household. The wife who is constantly driven to beg or wheedle the few dollars necessary for home purposes has become a beggar in her own house-hold. The services she renders her husband would demand a compensation on the open labor market far in excess of the total sum which is at her disposal every month. An ardent champion of those victimized by penurious husbands claims that the bridegroom receives about $385 worth of service a month from his bride. He offers this computation: "This fortunate lord of creation has in one woman a cook ($75 a month and keep); a chambermaid-waitress ($75 a month and keep); a valet ($100 a month and keep) ; a laundress ($40 a month); and a seamstress (who easily eats up four days a month at $5 a day, or a total of $20). After his children come, this excellent female Friday becomes also a governess-nurse, without relinquishing her other duties. As servant to the children, she represents $75 a month and food." Dr. John B. Leeds, how-ever, in his book The Household Budget, shows that fifty house-wives, when questioned as to the value of their services, gave an average estimate of $53 a month. No matter at which figure we may place the true value of a faithful wife's services, she ought to be, in every sense of the term, a full, responsible partner in the financial affairs of the home.

Normally, of course, the husband should direct the household treasury, not because women are incapable of maintaining a sane and sound financial supervision, but because money matters are the natural responsibilities of his leadership. In many instances, of course, a level-headed wife may save the family from financial fall. Nathaniel Hawthorne owed not only much of his literary inspiration to his wife but also a good part of the practical opportunity for quiet composure: It has been said that, if it had not been for Sophia, crippled as she was, we would probably not now remember Nathaniel. After losing his position in the custom-house, he hardly knew how to face his wife with the news. To his utter amazement, however, she exclaimed exultingly: "Now you can write your book!" And when Hawthorne objected bitterly, "Yes; and what shall we live on while I am writing it?" this astonishing woman revealed an unsuspected money reserve. "Where on earth did you get that?" Hawthorne demanded. "My husband," she replied, "I have always known that you were a man of genius. I knew that some day you would write an immortal masterpiece; so every week, out of the money you have given me for house-keeping, I have saved something. Here is enough to last us one whole year." So, for the first time in his life, Hawthorne could write undisturbed. In this freedom he wrote his masterpiece, The Scarlet Letter.

Martin Luther, after twelve years of married life, wrote: "God be thanked, I have a pious and true wife, in whom the heart of a husband may trust. I count her dearer than the kingdom of France and the dukedom of Venice." As the great Reformer explained in his will, her devotion to him extended also to the varied affairs of his unusual household. Luther's salary as professor at the university was two hundred gulden. He had no other professional income, since he refused special fees for preaching, lecturing, and translation, saying: "God be thanked that I have kept the reputation of not taking money." To offset this, it is true, gifts of provisions, and other necessities, including clothing and money, were frequently sent to him. Yet the open door to his hospitable home led many monks and nuns who had escaped from monastic restrictions, persecuted preachers, indigent students, poor relatives, to go in and out his lodging as though it were a public inn. At one time the Luther home housed thirteen nephews and nieces, eighteen children altogether. Besides, many visitors flocked to Luther, and some of them stayed in the parsonage for several years. Once the guests and visitors who sought help were so numerous that Luther wrote, "I was utterly overwhelmed by the crowds of poor people who come here from far and near as to an open house." When the Prince of Anhalt planned a visit to Wittenberg so as to enjoy a closer acquaintance with Luther, a friend wrote him that he should by no means plan to stay with Luther because his house was stuffed with an overflow of students, maidens, widows, and romping children. At the end of his third married year his generosity had forced him to incur debts to a total of one hundred gulden, and he was compelled to pawn three expensive gift chalices. When his salary was raised to three hundred gulden, his hospitality increased proportionately; and in all this it was his wife Katherine who superintended the little farm, raised flowers, fruit-trees, grape-vines, managed the meals, kept the domestic books balanced and, with all, memorized Scripture-passages.

Happy homes are built by mutual devotion and cooperative help; but when a wife seeks to retain her financial independence after the wedding or in the back-to-the-office-after-marriage philosophy maintains her own bank account and advocates a fifty-fifty plan for expenses, the feeling of life partnership has been sacrificed, the interdependence of husband and wife has vanished and the break-up of the home seems less formidable than it should.

Financial team-work, circumspect purchasing, systematic thrift, disciplined desires, and simplified standards of living are particularly necessary in these financially insecure years. Only in this way can there be "oil in the dwelling of the wise." Under the reign of improvidence, heedless squandering, and hand-to-mouth financing it is only a matter of marking time until the oil gives out and the dark of destitution spreads its pall of despair.
