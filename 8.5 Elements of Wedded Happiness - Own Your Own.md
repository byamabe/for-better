## 8.5 OWN YOUR OWN

Every man under his vine and under his fig-tree - 1 Kings 4:25

It is a far cry from Babylon's Ishtar Street in the sixth pre-Christian century to the sophistication of Park Avenue in present-day Manhattan. In comparison with the gilded apartments that raise their aristocratic penthouses to dizzy heights above the sidewalks of New York's wealthy boulevard, the clumsy adobe structures that fringed the streets of Nebuchadnezzar's capital seem hopelessly crude and uncouth. Even with the highly colored baked-enamel lions and the grotesque griffins by which the Akkadian architects sought to relieve the monotony of Mesopotamian walls, these Babylonian boulevards could not compete with the thoroughfare that still boasts of more millionaires than all England.

Yet in one significant feature Ishtar Street was notably more substantial than Park Avenue. As the researches of the late Prof. D. D. Luckenbill of the University of Chicago disclose, 80 per cent of the Babylonian families owned their own homes. Self-indulgent moderns may point to our luxurious apartments with their gilded salons and their Roman baths; our suites de luxe may embody the last word in comfort and refinement; yet the Babylonians prided themselves in something more essential: their cuneiform real-estate deeds, so carefully stored away that thousands of property titles have withstood the ravages of centuries, assure us that four out of every five families in Babylonia could say of their home, as unpretentious as it was, "This is ours."

### FINANCIAL ATTRACTIONS OF HOME-OWNERSHIP

With all social progress we have not been able to reach this percentage of home-ownership in our nation. However, it is gratifying to note that, according to the 1930 census, among 29,904,663 families in the United States there was a larger proportion of home-owners than in the previous decennial tabulations. This remarkable growth may be presented statistically as follows: In 1910, 9,083,711 families, or 44.8 per cent of the national total, owned their homes; in 1920, 10,866,960 families, or 44.6 per cent; in 1930, 14,002,074 families, or 46.8 per cent. The National Emergency Council pointed out that the 1934 home-mortgage debt in the United States is $21,000,000,000, the second largest single class of long-term indebtedness in the country. It is exceeded only by the Federal debt itself.

While less than half of our families own the buildings in which they live, the instinctive urge for home-ownership should live as strongly in American hearts as it ever did in the breast of any Babylonian. Direct advantages, tangible and intangible, come with the possession of a dwelling. Not the least of these are the varied financial attractions. It has been said, "More people have started on the road to financial independence through home-owner-ship than in any other way." An investment in a house carefully purchased and properly financed should be at least as good as a savings account and better than the $3,263,949,000 in deposits held in the 4,835 American banks that failed between October 31, 1929, and August 31, 1932. The cash equity in a wisely purchased house offers a feeling of security and financial independence. While the postwar years revealed the tragedy of frenzied finance, especially the purchase of overpriced stocks and bonds (they lost seventy-four billion dollars in value within less than three years), they illustrated even more strikingly why a well-financed home constitutes real estate.

When newly-weds make the first payment on their home, they accept the obligation of a mortgage, with a schedule of stiff payments; but as compensation they have the prospect of definite savings. A family can occupy, and pay for, a home at a cost only slightly more than the rental of an apartment of corresponding size; and when the payments have been completed, the home-owner is financially far ahead of the apartment-dweller. While the installments are being paid, the habits of thrift are systematically inculcated, and frequently there is the attraction of additional income. Often an income-bringing garage can be built on the lot, a portion of the house can be rented, or similar sources of income developed.

The epidemic of foreclosures that terrified the country, particularly since 1931, during which patient, plodding owners sacrificed a large portion of their life's earnings in the loss of their homes, may seem to contradict some of the roseate expectations attached to home-ownership. These tragedies, however, were consequent upon the fictitious values and the inflated prices that held sway in that reign of quick and easy money. Property was purchased far too expensively and financed on shoe-string policies that demanded mortgaging of the family income for an almost indefinable number of years. The Federal Housing Administration has analyzed the home-purchasing practices of the boom years 1922-1929 and has found these three principal evils: 1) the purchase of homes through second mortgages financed at exorbitant costs; 2) the excessive fees, in addition to high rates of interest, demanded for the renewal of maturing mortgages; 3) the practice of issuing loans on a fictitious, short-term basis, when the intention of both the lender and the borrower is to refinance the mortgage at the expiration of the period, with no provision for the gradual reduction of the mortgage from the income of the home-owner.

Today conditions governing the purchase of a home have vastly improved; values are genuine and Federal aid and financial regulation will help to minimize foreclosures. In the past, mortgages loomed before the average home-owner as a perpetual burden. By the provision of the Federal Housing Administration a young couple can build its home under the most attractive terms and with the best security home-purchasers have ever enjoyed. Among the features of the FHA plan (according to Form 2359) are: 1) lower financing charges; 2) long-term loans, extending in some cases up to 20 or 25 years; 3) advancement by the lender of a large part of the total value (up to 80 or 90 per cent, if circumstances warrant) ; 4) repayment in monthly installments, about like rent, suited to the borrower's income; 5) inclusion of taxes, assessments and fire insurance in the monthly payment; 6) elimination of monthly mortgages and the need for periodic and costly refinancing; 7) protection of the lender by a system of mutual mortgage insurance; 8) improvement of housing standards and conditions.

A house selected on the advice of competent realtors and then purchased and financed on these conservative lines is still a triple-A investment.

### MORE THAN DREAMS OF PROFIT

Yet it was not the dream of possible profit that lay at the bottom of those really successful households which, in the words of Ex-President Hoover, have made of the American home "the sanctuary of our loftiest ideals, a source of the spiritual energy of our people." The hope for a 1,000-per-cent appreciation in land value could never be the basis for that love of home which Longfellow eulogizes as being "interwoven with all that is pure and deep and lasting in earthly affections. Let us wander where we may, the heart looks back with secret longing to the paternal roof. There the scattered rays of affection concentrate. Time may enfeeble them, distance overshadow them, and the storms of life obstruct them for a season; but they will at length break through the cloud and storm and glow and burn and brighten around the peaceful threshold of home."

Merle Thorpe, editor of The Nation's Business, emphasizes some of the less tangible blessings that come with a family-owned home. He writes: "Both my wife and I were reared in homes owned by our parents. Our children have been reared in homes owned by their parents. In each case the ownership of the home contributed greatly to the well-being of the family. My experience has demonstrated that there is truth in the statement that the ownership of a comfortable home is a great source of happiness and that it ranks immediately after health and a good conscience. I believe that family stamina, family pride, family culture, and economic well-being are fostered when the family is its own landlord." The social background for the entire family; the playground space for the children, where they can romp without criticism; the moral independence of a life lived without interferences from an outside owner; the absence of restriction on the size of a family; the opportunities for individual expression, both within and without the home, all combine to emphasize the advantages of proprietorship.

Besides, a home-owner usually acquires business acumen and a sense of obligation to his community, which seeks expression in civic and municipal affairs. The permanency found in the environment of one's own home helps to establish contacts with neighbors, whose friendships will last for years. Perhaps it was the realization of this solidarity that prompted a progressive Chicago manufacturer to give $500 to each employee who had established a home-purchasing fund of the same amount. "A man who owns his own home," he claimed, "is worth $500 more to his employer than one who does not."

Social workers, juvenile-court judges, and police-matrons are emphatic in their assertions that the benefits of home-owning are not restricted to the first generation, but that there is a connection, incidental perhaps, but nevertheless real, between the ratio of juvenile crime and the title to the home. The opinion of Judge Francis B. Allegretti of the Chicago Boys' Court is significant: "Home-ownership on the part of more parents would stimulate parental care and attention and reduce offenses among juveniles, because lack of parental care causes by far the greater number of delinquencies among our youth. There cannot be an atmosphere of love, devotion, loyalty, and obedience in a residence where privacy is almost out of the question and room is at a premium."

Judge S. D. Murphy, who occupies a similar position in Birmingham courts, reports: "Eighty-seven per cent of the young delinquents of Jefferson County, Alabama, the seat of my juris-diction, come from habitats that do not belong to their parents. Behind home-ownership are some of the most desirable human qualities — love, ambition, thrift, personal and civic pride, all of which are fostered in the act of buying, or building, or paying for, a home. The child who must play on the city streets may be more apt to meet up with gangs; he may be more susceptible to activities that end in delinquency than the child who can expend his energies out in the open spaces in his own back yard."

### OPPOSING ATTITUDES

More than ever before, for well-known reasons, newly married couples are obliged to live with the parents of either husband or wife. This arrangement of course is far from ideal and should be adopted only under the stress of extreme emergency. Marriage could well be postponed for six months or a year if this delay would obviate the necessity of living under the parental roof. There the young couple is too constantly under the surveillance of those whose attitudes are necessarily different and sometimes, because of the disparity in ages, even contradictory. In a shared home, friction can too easily arise between the competing requirements of filial and marital devotion. Husband and wife may find their sense of mutual responsibility weakened, their domestic sensibilities atrophied, and their shiny dreams of wedded bliss tarnished. If restricted income demands this makeshift, let it be regarded •as a temporary expedient, to be supplanted, as soon as improved conditions permit, by normal, independent home-life.

Other trends in our modern philosophy of life are similarly directed toward weakening this "Own your own" ideal. We can pass by the hotel that tries to recoup business by offering attractive rates to married couples with complete emancipation from every obligation of cooking and cleaning. Such arrangements as well as the furnished-room plan, which because of its low cost makes a special appeal to some newly-weds, are not normally attractive to the average husband and wife. Much more pleasing — and proportionately more fatal to the ideal here set forth — is the apartment-house, with the glamor of its various "services" and its escape from many domestic duties. Under economic pressure one- or two-room apartments have been regarded with particular favor. They make it easier for the wife to continue her work, and they permit a maximum of time for outside purposes. Further, such "homes" are regarded as the least expensive and generally the most convenient start in married life. And finally a certain swanky atmosphere envelops the modern apartment.

These are highly questionable advantages. The independent business career of the apartment-house wife is often directly contributory to the blight of childlessness, which, in turn, characterizes most cases of divorce. Jurists and students of sociology tell us that, wherever the home ties are so few that the family belongings may be packed in a few suitcases and placed in the rumble seat of the sport roadster, the home has lost its stability and may quickly be broken up. Department stores, recognizing this ephemeral home-life, exert more than usual precaution in extending credit to these modern "cliff-dwellers." With all the alleged economic lure we have still to meet the couple that has attained to financial prominence by the apartment-house, no-child route.

We realize of course that the modern apartment will constitute an increasingly alluring prospect. The multiple home units built by the Swedish government, the modern family structures erected in large German cities, and the imposing architecture with which well-directed city-planning and philanthropy transform sections of New York City's lower East Side Ghetto are marvels of efficient construction. Their open areas planted with grass, flowers, and trees permit the free play of light and air on all sides. Chromium steel, unusual effects in brick and stone, colored tiling, and modern architecture combine to present pleasing exteriors, the attractiveness of which is reflected in ingenious interiors. Even the roofs of these family sky-scrapers, we are told, are arranged with a view of making an attractive impression on airplane passengers.

The house on wheels, commonly known as the trailer, introduces a new deterrent to home-ownership. At the beginning of 1936 about one third of a million Americans lived in trailers. If Roger Babson is correct, by 1956 one half of our population will be housed in these portable homes. The undeniable attractions that this mode of living may offer to those afflicted by the Wanderlust cannot be denied. Instead of "Own your own" many young couples have adopted the slogan "Ride your own." Yet as this motorized Gipsy life becomes more popular, it will offer complex family problems.

Nevertheless the individual home, its independence, its freedom for personal development, will continue to hold out the higher hope for happiness. Home-ownership of course is no guarantee against family misfortune; for there can often be harmonious understanding within the cramped quarters of an apartment, where happy families triumph over their environment. Neither is the title to a house, even a house entirely unencumbered by mortgage, in itself a pledge of domestic tranquillity. Yet a home purchased and financed with careful planning and a willingness to sacrifice will, under the blessing of God, normally help to fulfil some of our happiest ideals. It may not assume pretentious proportions, but it will help emphasize one of earth's great happinesses — the thrill of ownership, the assurance of possession.

### THE ACQUISITION OF A HOME

Only proportionately few couples will be able to start wedded life in possession of a home. But where there is a determined, intelligent, prayerful will, the proverbial way can usually be found.

Recently an organization of realtors sponsored a nation-wide competition that required a discussion of the intriguing theme "How I Acquired My Home." From the mass of 2,000 amazingly human documents which this contest called forth instances like the following are characteristic of the experiences in many American families:

"In Marshall, Virginia, a husband who was a day-laborer and not regularly employed and a wife who took in sewing laid by ten-cent pieces, quarters, and sometimes half dollars and in this way saved enough to buy a home."

"A man who is now a school-teacher in Oak Park, Illinois, came to Chicago penniless with a wife and children. They greatly desired a home and undertook to buy one on the West Side. This man became a manual-training teacher at a low salary. In order to make the payments on the small house, he was forced to sell dust-cloths from door to door on his way to school. He made all the furniture after hours in his manual training classroom and carted it home himself, eight miles, on a wheelbarrow because he could not afford to have it sent any other way. He finally paid for his home and in later years sold it. The proceeds bought a fine $35,000 home, in which they now reside. The father says that he would not have this home now had he not secured the first one in spite of such hardships."

"A young man in Worcester, Massachusetts, confronted with the problem of providing a home for his widowed mother and two children, had his whole life changed in effecting the solution. Until he was faced with this responsibility, he had stayed away from home every night and spent his surplus money on the cinema and other forms of entertainment. When he undertook the home-purchasing project, he had to cut down on such expenditures, and he found a great deal of time on his hands after work. He became interested in good books, took a course in engineering, was graduated, and found a new happiness in life."

"Equally interesting is the story of two sisters who came to the Land of Promise from Belgium a few years ago. They operated a tiny beauty parlor, and from its modest profits they purchased an $8,000 home."

"Other letters tell of a mail-carrier, making $1,500 a year, who built his own domicile; of a widow in Jackson, Michigan, who started out with ten dollars earned by domestic work and provided a home of her own for herself and her two children; of a Clevelander who purchased from the savings of a relatively small salary, borrowed $2,000 on it, and with this capital started a successful business of his own."

"Quite parallel to many of these achievements is the story of Mr. and Mrs. John McGill of Saint Louis, reported in the Post-Dispatch magazine of that city. With savings totaling less than $250, but with boundless energy and determination, they set about building their own home, remodel. ing an ancient two-room cottage, cementing their own cellar, installing their own wiring, papering their own walls, all with unlimited expenditure of effort, but with a startling minimum of monetary outlay. As the value of the property appreciated, it was possible to finance the whole plan by paying twenty-seven dollars a month."

One of the few private houses in New York City that have withstood the almost ruthless invasion of apartment houses and commercial buildings is occupied by Judge Morgan J. O'Brien, Justice of the New York Supreme Court. In a remarkable story he relates that he bought this spacious home by saving five-cent pieces. When his first salary started, he used to walk home instead of riding. The nickels which he saved in this way and through other economies he deposited in a box marked "Home." When the number of his legal clients grew and his income increased, he was able to save in much greater amounts. 'But as he specifically states, had it not been for the five-cent pieces with which this reserve fund began, he could not have purchased the home.

For a young man and a young woman who start together on the road to wedded happiness the purchase of a home should be a prime concern, because the cottage or bungalow that is paid for with the accumulation of slow and systematic savings or carefully financed with regular installments, creates and fosters ideals which often are otherwise unapproachable. Young people should lay well-formed plans for the acquisition of their own homes. Let them give up the luxuries, forego the pride of owning an auto-mobile, sacrifice expensive clothing. Instead let them save an extra dollar every week, work a little harder for a home that in a very personal sense is to be their own.

May not this ideal be implied in the Scriptural phrase picturing the peace and prosperity of Israel in its golden age, "every man under his vine and under his fig-tree" (1 Kings 4:25)? May we not assume that this is the house delineated in that hymn of domestic happiness which sings the blessings of a God-fearing husband: "Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house; thy children like olive-plants round about thy table. Behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord" (Ps. 128:3, 4) ?

### "BLESS THIS HOUSE"

A splendid custom, still perpetuated in Europe, dedicates a new home by invoking the blessing of God on its threshold. If we pause to remind ourselves that we spend more time within the walls of our home than in any other single locality, it will be apparent that we need the divine benediction there more constantly than elsewhere. Elaborate rituals have been prepared for this ceremony, but we need only a simple, sincere act of worship combining praise and prayer, thanksgiving and petition.

Daily the physical and spiritual welfare of the family should be brought before God. A suitable prayer for one's home is found in these lines, adapted from Helen Taylor:

Bless this house, O Lord, we pray.
Make it safe by night and day;
Bless these walls, so firm and stout,
Keeping want and trouble out;
Bless the roof and chimneys tall,
Let Christ's peace lie over all;
Bless this door that it may prove
Open e'er to joy and love.

Bless these windows shining bright,
Letting in God's heav'nly light;
Bless the hearth a-blazing there,
With smoke ascending like a prayer;
Bless the folk who dwell within,
Keep them pure and free from sin;
Bless us all that one day we
May, O Jesus, dwell with Thee.
