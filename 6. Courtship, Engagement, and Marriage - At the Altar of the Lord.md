## AT THE ALTAR OF THE LORD

Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. - Col. 3:17

About one million marriages are annually solemnized in the United States, As these lines are read, then, in thousands of homes prospective brides and grooms are engrossed in planning the details of their wedding. Invitation lists are being prepared, wedding-dresses fitted, trousseaus completed, menus inspected, forists' estimates compared, photographers consulted, bridesmaids instructed, honeymoons scheduled, and the many other details. of a modern marriage are successively arranged.

This prenuptial excitement, it often seems, devotes serious concern to every phase of the wedding except to the point of paramount issue, the ceremony itself. Scrutinizing care seeks to avoid any social faux pas that might mar the bridal conventions; yet the more vital questions as to where the marriage is to be solemnized, who is to officiate, and what pledges are required by the ritual are often lightly dismissed.

If a statistical sleuth could catalog the places where young people are united in marriage today, he would disclose a notable decline in the number of church-weddings and a startling increase not only in civil ceremonies but also in sensation-seeking stunts.

### VULGAR EXHIBITIONISM

The extremes to which irreverent "stunt" marriages have resorted is bewildering. Marriage vows were spoken in the air almost as soon as the Wright Brothers left the ground at Kitty Hawk; but it remained for a New York couple to substitute a parachute drop for a wedding-march. Jumping out of a Sikorsky cabin plane, 2,100 feet above Roosevelt Field, Long Island, after saying, "I do," to the tune of two 525-horse-power Hornet motors, the bride and the groom leaped into near tragedy. Spectators Looked up horror stricken as the capricious parachute of the bride of the ground.

Los Angeles witnessed a submarine wedding "solemnized" by the pastor of a local Universalist church. Seattle saw aquaplane nuptials, with bride, groom, and preacher towed through the harbor at sixty miles an hour; Brooklyn beheld a baseball-park wedding, a pastor of the Reformed Episcopal Church officiating. Lansing, Michigan, was entertained by a noisy carnival and a double wedding staged by the Knights of Columbus. Hoboken was startled by lion-cage rites, in which a New Jersey Baptist preacher united a circus lion-tamer with his quivering bride. Blasé Broadway gaped while a pastor of a New York Reformed Church read the marriage ritual in Cell No. 13 of an old convict ship anchored at the Battery. In short, it would not be easy to find a place too high or low, too dry or wet, too hot or cold, to be the locale of a wedding ceremony.

Common sense denounces this unholy masquerade and deep resentment is aroused when the sacred act is made a public spectacle, a publicity-craving farce, a snubbing insult to God. No wonder the newspapers bring head-lines like this: "Couple who was Wedded on Stage Spent Their Honeymoon in Jail." No wonder that the gifts showered upon a young couple married in a Chamber of Commerce ceremony in Ironton, Missouri, included free attorney's services for divorce! Marriages with vulgarly spectacular beginnings usually have fiasco endings. The most astounding angle of this uncouth exploitation is the ease with which some clergymen lend their name to such farces. As long as men called to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ engage in the antics of circus clowns, the Elmer Gantry type of novel will continue to feature the parasite preacher.

Europeans seem to show a more respectful attitude; for when a double wedding was performed in an airplane cruising over Berlin, the clergyman who read the ceremony in an altar-equipped plane was suspended from his pastorate. America can learn also from Australia. As soon as it was reported that a marriage ceremony would be performed on a mystery hike, the commissioner of the Victorian Railways refused to permit the train to start. His decision was supported by a commendatory editorial in the Melbourne Herald, concluding with this indictment of sensation-mongering clerics: "Clergymen who have been able to reconcile the freak weddings to their sacred office have pleaded the omnipresence [of God]. Logic would hardly be strained much further were "holy matrimony' entered upon before the grinning clown in a circus ring or amidst the guffahs of folly. at a performance of vaudeville."

### AMERICAN GRETNA GREENS

Much more frequent than these grotesque bids for notoriety are the clandestine ceremonies performed by a justice of the peace in some modern Gretna Green. This Dumfriesshire village on the border of England and Scotland, notorious until the middle of the last century, was popular with elopers, who could be married by the blacksmith, the ferryman, the toll-keeper, or by almost any citizen after they had crossed the Scotch border. In fact, Scotch law permitted marriage before witnesses without the service of an ordained clergyman. While the British law, under Lord Brougham's Act of 1856, altered this traffic in hasty marriages by demanding at least three weeks' residence in Scotland, the famous marrying place still retains its attraction. A local blacksmith, former Methodist preacher, married 1,700 couples over the anvil in six years; and in order to modernize this profitable business, local interests submitted the plans for a Gretna Green Aerodrome to the British Air Ministry. Its popularity recalls the Little Brown Church in the wildwood of Iowa where the pastor performed more than 2,000 wedding ceremonies in five years.

We have our own marriage centers that have capitalized the original Gretna Green idea. An investigation by the Russell Sage Foundation, covering a study of marriage-law practices in thirty States, disclosed the existence of fifty-seven "marriage-market towns" in twenty-nine States. In these places, runners are employed who, on account of competition, solicit business even by boarding automobiles in motion when they believe the occupants to be matrimonial candidates. Two justices in another marriage center advertised in street-cars: "Sweetheart, be ready at four o'clock. We'll go to —, just a short ride, and Justices - and - will tie the knot." Similar signs, displayed in other centers, extend such invitations as: "Let me hitch you up." "My couples stay married." "A marriage performed by Judge — lasts a lifetime."

William T. Martin, in the New York Times of October 4, 1935, gives this account of a marriage mill near Pittsburgh: "The 1930 census gave — a population of 6,398. Around the first of September this year's marriages in the town had been run up to more than 4,000, with four months to go. Last year the total of marriages in — was 4,397 and for the year before, 3,914.

"Not all the ministers of the town of course are parts of the mill. Some of them vigorously condemn the traffic in marriage, confining their own performance of such ceremonies largely to members of their own congregations. Five of them, however, are frankly commercial. One of these last year married 1,225 couples, and this year another performed 1,044 marriages in the first eight months. In the 'mill,' of course, are 'guides,' or favored taxi drivers. Fees of the minister range from $2 to $20; for the 'guides,' from $2 to $5. At certain stores near the court-house, wedding-rings may be obtained for from 10 cents to $10. While the license fee is $2, the office also sells marriage certificates running up to $5, according to binding."

Social workers in the Russell Sage study report one marriage mart in which the justice of the peace sets his regular fee for marriage at $3; but if the principals are eager to have their wedding glossed over without any newspaper publicity, this extra service raises the charge to $6. A grasping jeweler in another town had himself appointed notary and then advertised marriages without charge for all who purchased their rings at his place. Other justices of the peace supplied bridal veils, wedding-rings, even hats and coats — upon the payment of stated rental fees.

An eighty-five-year-old justice of the peace displayed this sign in his office window: "Marriages today only $1." When this cut rate failed to bring more business, he added this postscript: "A pound of breakfast coffee, tea, or cocoa to every couple."

The greed of some marrying justices may be seen from reports covering an unidentified marriage market. "There is a telephone girl so placed that she sees people when they pass through the corridor and into the license issuer's office. If she believes that they are seeking a marriage license, she telephones to a justice whose office is across the street. He then comes over and stays in the corridor until the pair who have just received a license appear. Of all the marriage fees procured in this way the telephone girl receives a share. Formerly justices in the town came into the license office itself and almost fought there over their quarry, but later these troublesome officials were denied admittance. The justice across the street was violently opposed, when interviewed, to any change whatever in the marriage laws. It was much better, he thought, to let people marry and then get divorced if things did not 'turn out all right.'" (Richmond and Hall, Marriage and the State, p. 222.)

### THE MARRYING PARSONS

Particularly obnoxious is "the marrying parson," the clergyman with no church who lives by commercializing the wedding ceremony. It is true that "only a small minority among ministers of religion can be charged with commercialism, while many of the justices have allowed their eagerness for marriage fees, however earned, to become notorious." Yet these few, forgetting the spiritual requirements of their office, helped to bring unwarranted criticism on the clergy in general. The tactics of marrying parsons are described in these excerpts from Richmond and Hall's studies:

"A former marriage-license clerk on the Pacific Coast describes his plan of helping retired and needy clergymen by sending license-holders to them for the marriage ceremony. One minister so favored was able at the end of four years to purchase a small ranch with his fees. The other clergymen had offered to share with this clerk all fees received from candidates sent by him.

"Under another former license official in a large city of the Middle West a certain clergyman was allowed to perform ceremonies in the license office and had a desk there where he sold unofficial marriage certificates suitable for framing.

"An officiant who formerly had been a circuit preacher established himself regularly in an unoccupied space at the court-house of his home town in Iowa. His procedures led to a protest on the part of the local ministerial association, and the court-house authorities ordered him out. Later he engaged quarters in a building directly opposite, where he tried to arrange with some of the other tenants to let him call upon them to act as needed witnesses at marriage ceremonies.

"A minister, after his retirement from active service, bought a house directly opposite one of the marriage-license offices in a Northwestern State and decorated this home with three signs. Two were hung at opposite ends of his front porch; the third was on a post in the center of his lawn. He complained to us that too many other ministers had now moved into the same neighborhood in order to avail themselves of the opportunity to perform marriage ceremonies.

"In a Pacific Coast city one of the retired clergymen used to advertise in the telephone-book that he would celebrate secret mar-riages. He also displayed a sign on his house, 'Marriages, $2.00.' A wedding-march was played so continuously upon his phonograph that the judge in the neighboring court-house entered a complaint.

"An evangelist in a Southern city was interviewed as he loitered about the court-house. If the people coming there looked at all like applicants for marriage licenses, he accosted them, explained that he was a minister and would be glad to serve them. He spoke to us with indignation of one man who, after promising to come back to him for the ceremony, had applied to a Catholic priest instead. One candidate from the country had said that he preferred to have a justice of the peace officiate because a gold seal would be affixed to his marriage certificate by the justice; but this minister assured him that he was willing and able to do as much and more." (L.c., pp. 282, 283.)

To counteract this attitude, many clergymen refuse to solemnize marriages if the two principals are unknown to them or do not come recommended. This policy precludes any charges of commercialism and helps prevent many domestic tragedies.

### A CHRISTIAN CEREMONY FOR CHRISTIANS

When young couples can secure marriage licenses and be united in matrimony by civil authorities in one tenth the time required to obtain an automobile license, the Church must reempha-size that, since marriage is not only a civil function but also a sacred institution ordained by God Himself, Christians should be married in a Christian ceremony.

Out in Girard, Kansas, Mr. Haldeman-Julius, publisher of successive infidel sheets, broke into print by having the marriage ceremony repeated before a civil authority ten years after his wedding. This man, who specializes in blasphemies, claims: "Marriage is a man-made institution, regulated by law. I have always regarded the fact that we were married by a preacher as a blot on our lives, and for the satisfaction of our intellectual integrity Marcet and I have agreed to go through the ceremony before a judge." But his civil ceremony was less binding than the church service; for not long after the judge had performed the second ceremony, the Haldeman-Juliuses were separated by a divorce decree.

The hazard to happiness often involved in weddings without the religious element is demonstrated in an interesting survey conducted by the editor of the Lutheran. Concluding that the civil marriage and the clandestine ceremony often lead to unhappiness, he summarizes: "The great bulk of the unhappy partners in wedlock either never went to a clergyman, or else they were strangers to the minister who married them. There is a great deal of significance in the fact that four fifths of these wrecks of hope for happiness are unknown to clergymen."

A pastor of The Little Church Around the Corner in New York, who because of the popularity of that marriage Mecca has had abundant opportunity to watch the wedding parade, is quoted as declaring that nine out of ten of the couples which eloped or rushed headlong into marriage lived unhappily. Young people who deliberately run away to get married by a justice of the peace or by some grasping preacher are not only guilty of breaking the commandment enjoining filial devotion, they have also cast aspersion on their Church and altogether have laid as firm a foundation for their future happiness as the Empire State Building would have in the Everglade swamps.

A word of friendly advice may be timely in urging our young people to be married by their own pastor. An official of our Church writes in a private communication: "In ever greater numbers our members, either with or without the knowledge and approval of their parents, go away from home to be married, in some cases by Lutheran pastors of our own Synod or by some Lutheran clergyman outside our Synodical Conference. I know that, if figures were available, we should be shocked at the revelation. Again and again this matter is discussed in our conferences. Even though in private conversation we instruct and admonish our young people, it seems that this condition becomes more general from year to year."

### IN CHURCH OR IN THE PARSONAGE?

A Methodist pastor recently stated: "Very few Methodist weddings are performed in the church. Of every one hundred weddings probably seventy-five are performed in the parsonage, ten in the church, and fifteen in other places." While this proportion of one church wedding out of ten is doubtless exceeded in other denominations, the parsonage has received uncontested preference. There the couple stands in the pastor's study or the sitting-room while the brief rites are performed and pleasantries exchanged in the few moments before the newly-weds leave. It is possible of course to solemnize Christian marriage anywhere — in the Sahara Desert, on the plateaus of Tibet, or on the coral reefs of a South Sea island. The marriage vows are always binding, no matter where spoken. Under ordinary circumstances, however, it is desirable that the Christian wedding be celebrated before the altar. The church is the house of the Lord. Here little children are received into the baptismal covenant; here Christian youth kneels to pledge itself for time and eternity to the service of Christ; here we pay the last tributes of lingering love to the memory of departed kin and friends; here in the mystic Sacrament human souls are strengthened by the very body and blood of their Redeemer. In what better place, we ask, should a man and a maid be joined in holy matrimony if not in their spiritual home? We heartily agree with the following extract from a letter of the Bishop of Montreal to his clergy: "I would therefore like to see all services of the church take place in the Father's house. Every baptism, wedding, and funeral should be in the church. The divine law of love will inspire each priest to deal with exceptional cases as they arise. These should not alter the application of the principle. I would ask you to urge upon your people the desirability of having all services in the church. It is more seemly, more reverent, more dignified, and shows more honor to God and to those for whom the services are held."

The reverential love of a church wedding is quite impossible in many of the hasty ceremonies outside the sanctuary. Even the worldly wisdom of a writer in Harper's Bazaar makes the pointed inference: "People who go through church ceremonies with a minister know they are married. It isn't like dropping in and having the knot tied by a justice of the peace, so that the partners of the pact have a hard time remembering the circumstances later. The affair gets so hazy that a careless young couple fails to recall whether they went before the justice that time to be espoused or to be fined for passing a red traffic light. Anyway, they conclude, it was one mistake or the other. So, let the wedding-bells ring out."

A church wedding in itself need cost not a penny more than any other ceremony. No throng of guests need be invited; formal dress is not required; lavish floral display and decoration may be missing; the strains of a high-priced orchestra are unessential. A young couple can reverently kneel before the altar and invoke the Savior's presence without incurring expenditures that may impair their finances. If congregations have the policy of charging our young people for the use of the church-building on such occasions, let them remember the decreasing number of church marriages in their circles!

More important than the scene of the wedding is the marriage service itself. When Christian young people are married, they should have at least a brief sermon or address, even if circumstances make it necessary or advisable to have the rites performed at home. The very importance of the occasion should suggest at least a few words of Scripture, a short address by the pastor, and a prayer for God's guidance. When the ceremony is in church and guests are invited, congregational singing and prayer should find a suitable place. How utterly unexplainable the attitude of many bridal couples whose wedding festivals last half the night with plenty of time for merrymaking, but who are too hurried to have a full marriage service with sermon, hymns, and prayers!

How God may use even the marriage service in the miracle of His conversion is shown in the remarkable story of Henry von Rohr, whose entire life was changed at the marriage altar. As a young man, brought up under the Prussian court influence and educated at military academies, he had lived without Christ. But, as his grandson writes (Walther League Messenger, May, 1939, page 598), "during the marriage service came his conversion to Christianity and the unquenchable thirst for religious truth. The sermon that day as well as subsequent sermons ... caused this worldly-minded young man to take an active interest in Lutheran theology. When his wife died with the birth of their first child, his adversities only strengthened his desires for a religious life." Years later he became an outstanding figure in the pioneer history of American Lutheranism.

### AN INTELLIGENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARRIAGE VOWS

Churches could render an important service to their young people if they would submit to all prospective couples a small, plainly written folder containing the exact meaning and requirements of the marriage ritual. It is not enough that a self-conscious bridegroom or a trembling bride knows when to say, "I do," or is able to repeat the marriage vows. It is not nearly sufficient that the steps from the church-door to the altar have been measured, the intervals of the procession gaged, and the entire wedding-march smoothly synchronized; the very center and climax of the whole service is the exchange of promises and pledges before God.

In the flutter of excitement many diversions may distract attention from the solemn words spoken by the officiating clergyman. The letter in which William Cullen Bryant broke the news of his wedding to his mother records, not without a grain of cynicism, the. thoughts of a disconcerted bridegroom.

"I hasten to send you the melancholy intelligence of what has lately happened to me.

"Early on the evening of the eleventh day of the present month I was at a neighboring house in this village. Several people of both sexes were assembled in one of the apartments, and three or four others, with myself, were in another. At last came in a little elderly gentleman, pale, thin, with a solemn countenance, pleuritic voice, hooked nose, and hollow eyes. It was not long before we were summoned to attend in the apartment where he and the rest of the company were gathered. We went in and took our seats; the little elderly gentleman with the hooked nose prayed, and we all stood up. When he had finished, most of us sat down. The gentleman with the hooked nose then muttered certain cabalistical expressions, which I was too much frightened to remember; but I recollect that at the conclusion I was given to understand that I was married to a young lady of the name of Frances Fairchild, whom I perceived standing by my side, and I hope in the course of a few months to have the pleasure of introducing to you as your daughter-in-law, which is a matter of some interest to the poor girl, who has neither father nor mother in the world."

We take deliberate time in signing agreements that concern real estate, property, or financial obligations. In the most intimate earthly relationship, should we not have a full understanding of its obligations and privileges as well as of the effectual help which God promises? In what more practical way can the Church supplement its pastors' sermons on these subjects than by plain, printed outlines explaining in detail the meaning of the wedding ritua!?

### THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY

The form which the wedding ceremony assumes varies in different churches. In Lutheran circles and in many Protestant churches the ceremony begins with some introductory remarks by the pastor, in which "those who purpose to enter the holy estate of matrimony" are asked "to hear what the Word of God teacheth concerning it." After appropriate Scripture-passages follows the pointed question to the groom in these words:

"Wilt thou have —, here present, to be thy wedded wife?

Wilt thou love, honor, and cherish her and keep with her this bond of wedlock holy and unbroken till death you do part? If so, declare it before God and these witnesses by saying, 'I will.'"

After the groom has answered, "I will," the bride is asked:

"Wilt thou have —, here present, to be thy wedded husband? Wilt thou love, honor, cherish, and obey him and keep with him this bond of wedlock holy and unbroken till death you do part? If so, declare it before God and these witnesses by saying, 'I will.'"

After the bride has answered, the wedding-ring may be placed on her finger. Many prefer the double-ring service. Then both are directed to join their hands. In the longer service the groom repeats after the minister:

"I, —, in the presence of God and this assembly, take thee, –, to be my wedded wife and plight thee my troth in every duty, not to part from thee till death us do part."

Likewise the bride pledges:

"I, —, in the presence of God and this assembly, take thee, , to be my wedded husband and plight thee my troth in every duty, not to part from thee till death us do part."

After these pledges in the longer service or after the bestowal of rings, the pastor declares:

"What God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. forasmuch as — and — have consented together in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before God and this assembly, I pronounce them husband and wife in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."

The bridal couple then kneels, the pastor asks God's blessing upon the new husband and wife, lays his hands on their heads, speaks the Lord's Prayer, and concludes with the benediction.

It is a simple ceremony, but because of its lifelong importance it should be carefully studied in advance of the wedding-day, so that with calmness and conviction the young people can intelligently and reverently pledge themselves to the obligation of this promise.

### HERE COMES THE PRIDE!

A church wedding may lose in solemnity by overemphasis on externals. Dr. Caleb R. Stetson, rector of Trinity Church (Episcopal) in New York City, the wealthiest parish in the United States, speaks frankly on the exploitation of church ceremonies: "What are called 'fashionable' weddings are often vulgar displays of wealth. The church is so decorated with palms and trees and Powers that it resembles a flower show more than a church, and it is made difficult to realize that it is the house of God or that a religious service is taking place there."

Perhaps it was revolt against such showy marriages that prompted a young lady to write: "Why do pastors advise church weddings when they are often merely fashion parades instead of solemn and blessed occasions? Should not God's house be a place of worship and not a salon in which the latest styles can be dis-played? Many bridal parties concentrate more on their appearance than on the minister's message and the marriage ritual. They find it hard to keep their minds on what the minister is saying and instead ask themselves, I wonder what the people think about the flowers. I wonder how I looked when I came in. I hope the flower-girls do not make a mess of things,' etc. I am sure that these are among the many thoughts of the bride; for those who have gone through the ceremony tell me that they were so nervous at their weddings that they were unaware of anything the pastor said or did. Then, why have elaborate church weddings? They are indeed a mockery; they employ God's house in vain.

It is unfair to generalize on the basis of extremes and abuses. Yet it frequently happens, even in Christian circles, that the fashion-show appeal predominates and weddings degenerate into competitive expenditures of money, with one bridal couple trying to outdo the other. To judge by extravagance and exhibition a more appropriate wedding-march would sometimes be "Here Comes the Pride." An endless, snail-like wedding procession, with an overdressed male contingency, but with bride and bridesmaids parading in the opposite state, — these are hardly the appropriate preparations for marriage. After all, the girl who is not thinking exclusively of her face and appearance, but who asks God to keep her faithful will make the better wife, the truer companion, the more loving mother, just as nobler husbandly impulses may beat beneath blue serge that under formal evening dress.

This is not a veiled attack on the propriety of attractive church weddings. We are out of sympathy with a professional counselor in the affairs of the heart who chides a young bride because "it is always the girl who wants the big church wedding with white satin and orange blossoms and a long veil and bridesmaids." Christian young women are entitled to as impressive a weading as their means will permit, as long as the solemnity of the occasion is not destroyed by externals. It is the day in a girl's life in which she should appear amid the most pleasing surroundings. Let cynical scoffers read the Forty-fifth Psalm, in which the beauty of an attractive wedding procession is described as a symbol and prophecy of the mystical union between Christ and His bride, the Church.

A wedding that does not degenerate into a display of clothing and extravagance, but that is concluded with a full consciousness of its sacred import will be the gateway, under divine blessing, to lifelong happiness. The song of a wedded life is usually sung to the melody intoned on she wedding-day. Christ-centered weddings lead to Christ-endowed homes.
