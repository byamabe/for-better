## 6.2 ENGAGED!

What man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her? - Deut. 20:7

"And they agreed to become engaged, at least as long as she stayed at the beach that summer." This conclusion to a Sunday-magazine story typifies one of the deplorable commonplaces of our day, the disregard of the binding power of an engagement promise. Engagements are often made with little or no thought of their meaning and broken at the slightest whim. A young man and a young woman meet, they become infatuated, and after a whirlwind courtship of a week or ten days they are "engaged." Petulant misunderstandings lurk in the offing: a selfish gesture ruffles the placid course of their devotion, and the marriage promise, lightly made, is just as lightly broken.

Too frequently American fiction applauds the girl who proudly displays a list of previous engagements as so many brilliantly acquired trophies. Magazines purporting to embody college humor picture the predicament of the co-ed who finds herself compromised by a half dozen engagements at one time. Drug-store novels glorify the young blades who are ready to enjoy the privileges of the marriage promise without being willing to pledge themselves to a relation which they may hesitate to acknowledge publicly.

Nor are these attitudes simply the notions of immature youth. Dr. Paul Popenoe, director of the Institute of Family Relations, Los Angeles, claims: In "the betrothal period a choice has been made, but it is more or less provisional. If on closer acquaintance the betrothed find that they have made a mistake, it can still be rectified before any permanent commitments have been entered into. From this point of view the social attitude toward betrothal should not be too rigid. When engagement is regarded as equally sacred and binding with marriage, this function is largely lost." (The Journal of Social Hygiene, Vol. XX, No.9, December, 1934.)

Dr. Erdman Harris, associate professor of religious education and psychology at Union Seminary, whom the St. Louis Post-Dispatch describes as "an expert in college circles," asserts that an "engagement should be broken if one or the other discovers some quirk in the other's character, some incident in his or her past, that reveals unexpected and unpleasant habits and attitudes." "Even if the organist is playing the wedding-march when the discovery is made," this university mentor warns, "don't hesitate. Tell him to change the tune. Return the presents."

On the other hand, this attitude, which makes engagement only a temporary promise pledging a more or less exclusive companionship, is opposed by the exaggerated conception which jumps at conclusions and magnifies the simple acts of friendship into the proportions of a formal engagement. Often young people take too much for granted and consider the attentions of a friend equivalent to an engagement, although no definite pledges have been given. Much heartache and rankling disillusionment would be spared if it were generally understood that courtship is not engagement; that not even the expressed wish or hope or expectation of marriage is engagement.

### BETROTHAL IN THE BIBLE

As we compile the Bible references to betrothal, we find no command requiring betrothal and no specific legislation regulating its formalities. It is accepted as a social institution, and the few passages in which it is mentioned draw a picture of betrothal along lines similar to those with which the wider Semitic archeological developments have familiarized us.

In Old Testament times betrothal was a formal, rigid pro-cedure. The young man, or his parents, paid to the bride's parents a stipulated dower, or bridal price, as compensation for the services which she would no longer render in her home. This legal procedure, usually witnessed and recorded, was often the only formality connected with marriage. Among the Arabs even today betrothal has this distinction, and in the account of Isaac's marriage (Gen. 24:63-67) there seems to have been no additional ceremony.

Parental consent was essential for every betrothal. When Isaac came of age, he did not choose his own wife; his father took the initiative and paved the way for the happy union with Rebekah (Gen. 24:3 ff.). When Jacob fulfilled his contract with Laban and was ready to marry Rachel, he went to her father and said: "Give me my wife" (Gen. 29:21). The Israelite father, according to the Old Testament legislation, could refuse to give his daughter to a suitor and thus prevent marriage (Ex. 22:17; Deut. 7:3; Num. 30:3 ff.). Yet the pledge of betrothal was bestowed of a free will. Parents did not tyrannically impose their own preference upon their children. The example of Rebekah's family in ascertaining her inclinations toward the prospect of marriage with Abraham's son and in asking the question "Wilt thou go with this man?" doubtless shows how most betrothals were introduced.

After the pledge of betrothal the young woman was virtually regarded as a wife. Her husband could claim her immediately or after an interval which ranged from a few days (Gen. 24:55) to a year, according to later custom. But the principle remained: once the betrothal was effected, the husband could take the bride as his and celebrate the nuptials when and how he chose. Betrothal established the marriage relation. An Zacab, calls Rachel his "Wise, ment, Mary is called a wife although it is specifically added that she was a "virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph" (Luke 1:27; Matt. 1:18-20). In addition, there are passages in which engagement is in some respects equated with marriage. Thus Deut. 22:23 shows that the violation of a betrothed virgin is punishable exactly as the same crime when committed against a married woman. And Mielziner (The Jewish Law of Marriage and Divorce, p. 75) concludes: "Betrothal is not a mere promise to marry, but it is the very initiation of marriage." In short, when the Old Testament speaks of betrothal, it pictures a definite, un-qualified, formal act which makes the two young people essentially husband and wife.

### ENGAGEMENT TODAY

Any one who understands the trends of our times will concede that this conception of espousal is often as far removed from the American mind as the very word "betrothal" is from our popular vocabulary. In our day parents often have very little to say in the matter of engagements. Either parental disinterestedness permits the children to select their life mates, or the young people resent any well-meant advice and feel offended when Father or Mother raise their voices in warning against the person of their choice.

Especially is the Scriptural conception of engagement as a sacred, binding, inviolable promise opposed to the prevalent opinion. Even the Catholic Church teaches: "For good reasons it [an en-gagement] may be honorably rescinded. And one such reason net may be honorably would be if, after being engaged to a man, a girl would become conscious of having the chance to procure a much more desirable and valuable marriage partner than the one to whom she promised her troth." (Youth's Pathfinder, by Rev. Fulgence Meyer, O. F. M., p. 343.) With this ecclesiastical endorsement of an opportunist policy in engagement, we are not surprised to find that for great masses of young people, engagement is nothing more than a conditional agreement that may be kept or broken as the course of expediency seems to dictate.

### THE CHURCH'S IDEAL

In sharp protest the Church's attitude toward engagement may be summarized in this formal definition: When, with the consent of their parents, a young man and a young woman who can enter a valid marriage voluntarily and unconditionally promise to marry, this pledge constitutes a valid engagement, which must not be broken.

The Church thus insists upon parental blessing. According to the laws of the land young people may shift for themselves after their twenty-first year; but according to the laws of God sons and daughters are solemnly required to honor their parents during their entire lives. Say what we will about parental interference, maternal selfishness, or lack of parental adjustment to modern conditions, the fact remains that Christian young people should consult their parents, respect their wishes, and receive their blessings in questions of courtship and marriage. Usually the experience of a Christian father and the devotion of a Christian mother will qualify them as preeminently trustworthy counselors.

It follows, then, that the Church cannot recognize the so-called secret engagement, made without parental knowledge or against parental will, provided this disapproval has Scriptural base and reason, as has been pointed out. Consequently Christian ministers will not marry young people when the objection of their fathers and mothers cannot be overruled by the Word of God. Very often, however, parents have clearly granted a tacit permission when they have seen their children keep "steady" company and have not raised their voices in protest. This precludes the validity of subsequent parental disapproval.

Only morally shallow young people will enjoy the privileges which they may associate with their private promise of marriage and later, when they experience a change of heart, condone their actions by claiming that, since they had kept their engagement secret, it is without all validity and binding power. A girl who, let us say, for a year or two has permitted a young man to restrict his attentions upon her and who has repeatedly given him good reason to assume that she will marry him, even if there is no formal, legal basis for this assumption, cannot suddenly change her mind and, taking recourse to a technicality, insist that, since her parents have not approved, there can be no valid engagement. She cannot find a formal flaw in the fact that there is no engagement in the technical exactitude of that term. She is bound by her conscience to marry the young man who has been encouraged to interpret her words and actions as consent.

Similarly objectionable are attempts to coerce the free will and decision, like that described in the following press item: "Unless Charles F. Corbin, son of the late Philip Corbin, head of the American Hardware Company, marries or becomes engaged before next Saturday, he will lose a considerable part of his share in the final settlement of his father's estate of more than $5,000,000. In reply to a flood of inquiries he only says: 'I am not married; I do not expect to be married or engaged by Saturday. The financial reward is not sufficient to make me take the risk.'" In the same way marriage promises exacted nder the threat of punishment or pledges elicited in a state of drunkenness are not engagements and have no binding power.

The Church further refuses to recognize as valid engagements those arrangements in which the promise repudiates the very purpose wedding entirely uncertain. Thus, if a young man and young woman promise to marry, but the fiancée insists upon having no children, this is not a binding engagement, for it overrules the ordinances of God. Or if a young man promises to marry when he has saved $5,000 or when he receives a salary of $50 a week, this is a conditional promise, but it is no engagement. His savings may never reach the desired goal, or his salary may be cut, and by the very condition he imposed he could not marry. Engagement is an unqualified pledge. Unfortunately many "engagements" are made with the clear-cut understanding that, if later there is a change of affection, either party is free to make other arrangements. This attitude, as popular and wide-spread as it is, is fundamentally opposed to the Church's conception of engagement. And one of the Church's many educational projects should be directed toward giving its young people sound information on the meaning and binding force of a Christian engagement.

The Church finally insists that engagement is not a temporary. halo of happiness which can be discarded as soon as its luster seems to tarnish. Engagements cannot be broken with impunity. Two young people who are truly affianced in the Scriptural sense have entered a holy relation, which should not be severed even by mutual consent, parental permission, or change of mind. In general, the only reasons recognized by the Church for which a true engagement may be broken are similar to those which annul or disrupt marriage — acts of fraud, of unfaithfulness, or malicious desertion. When engagements are heedlessly fractured, a holy relation has been disfigured by a grievous sin. The consciousness of this fact may be dulled in the laxity of our age and the seriousness of this whimsical breaking of engagements minimized; but a better and happier day would dawn if the full implication of Christian engagements were understood and followed.

### A PROFOUND LESSON

The period of courtship preceding engagement should therefore be a time of careful and adequate appraisal. Young people who defiantly urge the ever-repeated claim that it is better to break an engagement than to break a marriage or that it is far more practical to discover incompatibility, though engaged, before the wedding than after, are indulging in shallow argumentation. The business world would not countenance for a moment the application of these principles in the conduct of its transactions. If a man contracts to buy a house, he must buy it; if he pledges himself to participate in a project, he must participate or pay damages. Yet, we are told, when a young man in formal engagement promises to marry, he ought to be permitted the privilege of changing his mind if he believes that he has been mistaken in his judgment. Even legal procedures in practically all civilized countries recognize the damage that may accrue from the broken engagement and demand financial compensation for the injured party. A young woman whose fiancé has broken his pledge may sue her former betrothed for damages sustained by the breach of his promise. She may also find cause for action against any intermeddlers. In most cases, never aired before a court, the heartache and the disillusionment are too deep to be computed in dollars.

The best interests of young people demand a period of courtship long enough for both to arrive at certainty regarding the qualifications of their life partner. Only when every vestige of doubt has been removed and both young people are convinced (after an acquaintance long enough to make this conviction intelligent and personal enough to make it complete) that they love each other, - only then, after having committed the whole issue to God in earnest prayer, should the first step toward an engagement be taken.

### A THRILLING PRELUDE

The discussion up to this point has been somewhat technical; for the general misconception of engagement as the Church understands it necessitates a clear-cut statement of basic facts. However, the happiness of two young people affianced is by no means coldly formal. The months of engagement that separate the fluttering and suspense of courtship from the new responsibilities of married life often form the happiest of life's pleasures. Engagement is a thrilling prelude, vibrant in the joy of love, almost tremulous in the anticipation of unfolding, deepening devotion. When two Christian young people enter a true engagement, they belong to each other, and both God and man are happy with them in this new relation, in the bestowal of their caresses, and in the expression of endearment. The power which has drawn them together and led them to announce their marriage promise is one of the strongest and holiest impulses which the all-wise Creator has planted in the human heart. Love, when sanctified by the Savior's grace, is a purifying and uplifting power, so intense that it far surpasses any other earthly blessings which God has showered upon His children. When, by the provident guidance of Him who brings husband and wife together, two Christian hearts find each other and announce that they are pledged until parted by death, the Church says to them: "Enjoy your love. Enjoy the endearments with which your mutual affection may be expressed. Enjoy everything which your devotion, purified as it is through Christian faith, brings you. But always remember that you are Christ's and that your bodies must be kept as temples of the living God." Let crepe-hanging ascetics brand this newly bestowed love as carnal; let misguided zealots insist that a life without the joy and pledge of a marriage promise is the holier existence; the fact remains that, when two hearts and lives are betrothed in Christian engagement, they have reached the foothills of earth's ecstasy.

Yet engagement does not break down all reserve nor remove the last barriers. By a peculiar argument some newly engaged young people permit themselves to feel that now, being pledged to each other before the world, they can give unlimited evidence of their love. Any voice of protest which an insistent conscience raises is silenced by the appeal that they are virtually married and that therefore it cannot be wrong for an engaged couple to assume the privileges of marriage.

At the 1934 Conference for Marriage and Family Social Relations in Columbia University's Teachers' College, Dr. Robert Laton Dickinson, secretary of the National Committee on Maternal Health, said that he had quizzed fifty couples of high intelligence in 1895 and had learned that one engaged couple in five had assumed marital privileges before marriage. In 1930 he investigated fifty more cases. One pair in three admitted similar intimacy. The questioning was repeated in 1934, when he learned that every other couple had not waited for the ceremony. His findings were confirmed by Lester Winthrop Dearborn, Boston psychologist and president of the Massachusetts Society for Social Hygiene. He asserted on the basis of 200 case investigations in Boston that today half of these engaged couples were as good as married.

We believe that the ratio in church circles must be notably lower; yet pastors tell us that clear, concise expression is necessary to remove any haze of uncertainty in regard to the demands of decency. It must be borne in mind that under all circumstances the wedding ceremony is required for the consummation of marriage privileges. To demand all before marriage is a sinful overstepping of bounds which outrages convention, promotes dishonesty, detracts from the joy of marriage, and helps to create a worried state of uncertainty that can neither be free from remorse nor undisturbed by an accusing conscience. Happy the bridal couple that approaches the altar in the heightened joy of that purity presupposed by the Christian wedding ceremony!

For this reason, among others, the days of engagement should be few. If after a sufficiently long courtship the time of engagement could be reduced to two or three months, much of the misunderstanding and inner pain that sometimes mar the beauty of betrothal would vanish. Engagements that last five or ten years usually are unfortunate. Sometimes the sheer force of circumstances offers no escape from a long engagement. When Matthew Fontaine Murray, the profound meteorologist, later to be acclaimed "the Pathfinder of the Sea," gave his sweetheart, Ann Herndon, a ring engraved with these words of Scripture "The Lord watch between thee and me when we are absent one from the other," he little thought that it would be nine years before the pledge of his engagement could be fulfilled in marriage. Other betrothed have been obliged to wait even longer. While occasionally harsh circumstances may necessitate the unexpected postponement of marriage, normally these prolonged periods of delay are unnecessary and sometimes serve as an unworthy covering for attitudes or actions which should be censured. An analysis of the reasons for postponing marriage after an announcement of the engagement will reveal in most cases an unmistakable element of selfishness. This delay complex is based on either the unwillingness of the future brides and grooms to relinquish their freedom and assume the mutual obligations of marriage; or on the absurd adherence to difficult financial or social goals; or on the selfish intrusion of parental influence; or, perhaps more frequently, on the insistent and pervading uncertainty as to whether marriage is advisable after all, the despicable thought that perhaps a more attractive match may present itself; or on other allied motives which should have been answered and dismissed before the very thought of engagement was contemplated. The aftermath of these almost interminable extensions is frequently seen in a gradual but unmistakable fade-out of love. Much suffering could be avoided if engagements were postponed until the wedding-day can be designated.

### A TIME OF PREPARATION

The months of engagement are to follow the definite direction of preparation for marriage. With all the ecstasy of this new relation, many practical questions present themselves for answer. During courtship these issues were subordinated, since the future home, the matter of income, furniture, food, were hazy anticipations only incidentally woven into the gossamer of romance. After engagement they materialize into more mundane realities. A thoughtful anticipation of these issues during the betrothal bliss will do much to reduce the perplexing posthoneymoon problems.

With engagement the time has come when the future husband must study the best purchases at the best price. During these weeks the hope chest, that mysterious treasure-trove of feminine delight, is metamorphosed from a catch-all for pin-cushions, finger-tip towels, souvenir spoons, and odd pieces of bric-a-brac into a sternly practical household chest with linens, towels, pillows, and blankets.

It is to be regretted, in passing, that the trousseau of the modern bride often restricts itself to an up-to-date wardrobe. In Grandmother's day the well-equipped bride brought with her at least the standard dozen of all table utensils and linens. Today this premarriage outfit often shares the fate of our securities and drops to six and even to an all-time low of four — new evidence of Lilliputian ideals in our Titan age.

By way of contrast read these items of a dowry which a Puritan father ordered from England for his engaged daughter:

"Curtains and valens for bed with counterpane, head cloth, and tester made of good yellow watered worsted camlet with trimmings well made and bases if it be the fashion. Send also of the same camlet and trimming as may be enough to make cushions for the chamber chairs.

"A good, fine large chintz quilt well made.

"A true looking-glass of black walnut frame of the newest fashion if the fashion be good, as good as can be bought for five or six pounds.

"A second looking-glass as good as can be bought for four or five pounds, same kind of frame.

"A Duzen of good Black Walnut Chairs fine Cane with a Couch.

"A Duzen of cane chairs of different figures and a great chair for a chamber; all black walnut.

"One bell-metal skillet of two quarts, one ditto one quart.

"One good large warming pan bottom and cover fit for an iron handle.

"Four pairs of strong iron dogs with brass heads about five or six shillings a pair.

"A brass hearth for a chamber with Dogs Shovel Tongs & Fender of the newest Fashion (the Fire is to ly upon iron).

"A strong Brass Mortar that will hold about a Quart with a Pestle.

"Two pair of large Brass sliding Candlesticks about five shillings.

"Two pair of large Brass Candlesticks no sliding, of the newest Fashion, about five or six shillings a pair.

"Four Brass Snuffers with stands.

"Six small strong Brass Chafing dishes about four shillings apiece.

"One Brass basting Ladle; one large Brass Ladle.

"One pair of Chamber Bellows with Brass Noses.

"One small hair broom suitable to the Bellows.

"One Duzen of large hard-metal Pewter Plates new Fashion, weighing about 14 pounds.

"One Duzen hard-metal Pewter Porringers.

"Four Duzen, of Small glass Salt Cellars of White glass; Smooth not wrought, and without a foot.

"A Duzen of good Ivory-hafted Knives and Forks."

We may profitably consider the contrasted ideals and policies of two types of young people, the drones and the workers of the human hive. Here is the couple that regards the period of engagement as high-flying months of expensive pleasure. They frequent the fashionable restaurants, pay prohibitive prices for entertainment, and, systematically developing expensive tastes, cultivate a mode of living far beyond their possibility of maintenance when the honeymoon is over. After the wedding ceremony they enter their life's companionship quite unprepared for its sterner realities. They purchase costly furniture at exorbitant prices and involve themselves in the meshes of instalment payments. Not infrequently both become dissatisfied with the step-down that marriage has brought in the simpler standard of living.

Another couple, however, places a rational maximum on its expenditures, devotes evenings to the planning for the future home, its furnishings and decorations, and is seriously concerned about the long range of domestic arts, from the practical requirements of cooking to the more artistic harmonies of color schemes. They are ready to start in a small way, by systematic savings and cautious expenditures to secure their own home and make it an attractive and restful dwelling.

No lengthy argument is required to show which of these two couples has proceeded along the happier course. A word of warning against the high cost of wooing may be necessary. Refreshing to a high degree is this brief paragraph by Cornelia Stratton Parker in her prize-winning American Idyll, the life of her husband, Carleton H. Parker (p. 18): "No one, no one on this earth, ever had the fun out of their engaged days that we did when we were together. Carl used to say that the accumulated expenses of courting me for almost four years came to $10.25. He just guessed at $10.25, though any cheap figure would have done. We just did not care about doing things that happened to cost money."

Altogether, then, engagement is as serious and prayer-provoking as it is vibrant with anticipation of the future and exultant in its present joy. Engaged couples should not permit themselves to lose. sight of the fact that, while their affianced state is really a preface to their book of marriage, the very foreword of this book of varied and vital contents must strike a sober, thoughtful key-note and be penned in the happy and reverent terms of Christian consecration.
