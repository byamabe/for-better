## 8.7 AT THE FAMILY ALTAR

As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord - Josh. 24:15

Almost every one of the seven million high-school students in our country is familiar with Robert Burns's The Cotter's Saturday Night. In homely lines the poet takes us to the cottage of a Scotch patriarch when the children return to the paternal roof after a week of toil. The climax is reached in this depiction of the devotional hour:

The cheefu' supper done, wi' serious face
They round the ingle form a circle wide;
The sire turns o'er with patriarchal grace
The big ha'-Bible, ance his father's pride;
His bonnet rev'rently is laid aside,
His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare;
Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide
He wales a portion with judicious care,
And "Let us worship God" he says with solemn air.

They chant their artless notes in simple guise;
They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim.
Perhaps Dundee's wild warbling measures rise
Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name;
Or noble Elgin beets the heavenward flame,
The sweetest fear of Scotia's holy lays.
Compared with these, Italian trills are tame:
The tickl'd ears no heartfelt raptures raise;
Nae unison hae they with our Creator's praise.

The priestlike father reads the sacred page,
How Abram was the friend of God on high
Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage
With Amalek's ungracious progeny,
Or how the royal bard did groaning lie
Beneath the stroke of Heaven's avenging ire,
Or Job's pathetic plaint and wailing cry,
Or rapt Isaiah's wild seraphic fire,
Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre.

Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme:
How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed;
How He who bore in heaven the second name
Had not on earth whereon to lay His head;
How His first followers and servants sped,
The precepts sage they wrote to many a land;
How he who lone in Patmos banished
Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand
And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounced by
Heaven's command.

Then, kneeling down to heaven's eternal King,
The saint, the father, and the husband
Hope springs exulting on triumphant wing
That thus they all shall meet in future days,
There ever bask in uncreated rays,
No more to sigh or shed the bitter tear,
Together hymning their Creator's praise
In such society, yet still more dear,
While circling time moves round in an eternal sphere.

### BREAKING WITH THE PAST

Unfortunately the reality of this family worship is as far removed from our America of today as its Scotch dialect from our present parlance. When Calvin Coolidge, "sworn in" by his father after the death of President Harding, took his oath of office on the Coolidge family Bible, that act brought to memory the family Scriptures in the American home of the past generations. We recalled the pages between the Testaments perpetuating the family record of births, marriages, and deaths, painstakingly inscribed by gnarled fingers; we were reminded of the decorous figures of America's yesterday, that spoke in measured syllables of Jacobean English, of the long list of eminent Americans who were given Bible names, and of the importance which the family Bible assumed in those halcyon days as the very center of the American Christian home.

In our apartment era, the family altar has often become an antiquarian curiosity. Henry C. Cope, General Secretary of the Religious Education Association, laments in his study Religious Education in the Family (p. 126): "Family worship has declined until, at least in the United States, the percentage of families practicing daily worship in the home is so small as to be negligible."

A few years ago a census of the number of homes participating in family worship was taken through a questionnaire sent to members in some 150 typical congregations of the Lutheran Church, a body which is commonly regarded as retaining more pronounced interest in family prayers. Figures were secured from a cross-section of the congregations in various parts of the country: from American churches and foreign-language groups, from old established churches as well as from mission-chapels and preaching-stations. The first question asked was: "Do you have family devotion in your home?" Of the thousands who submitted information, 60 per cent admitted that the Bible was not read regularly in the family circle and family prayers were never spoken in their home environment. Other evidence shows that this is a very high average. For instance, in a prayer investigation conducted by a church federation on Long Island a large portion of those interrogated admitted that they prayed altogether "once or less a day."

While some regard this neglect of the family altar as an encouraging sign of enlightenment, calm thinkers will agree with the statement of the Wall Street Journal, which as early as 1921 declared: "What America needs ... is a revival of piety, the kind Mother and Father used to have, piety that counted it good business to stop for family prayers before breakfast right in the middle of the harvest, that quit work a half hour earlier Thursday night so as to get the chores done and go to prayer-meeting. That is what we need to rid this country of graft and of greed, petty and big, of worship of fine houses and big lands and high office and grand social functions."

### RADIATED BLESSINGS

The blessings radiated by the family altar may be tested in the laboratory of life as it is lived today. The words of the Rev. F. C. Michelfelder, superintendent of the Lutheran. Inner Mission Society of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, are meaningful: "In five years of Inner Mission experience we have asked hundreds of men and women who professed Christianity but became dependent or delinquent, and only by way of exception have we found that they had been accustomed to a family altar where there is regular reading of God's Word and devotions."

The force of home worship in its molding influence can hardly be exaggerated. Dr. Charles M. Sheldon, well-known religious writer, emphasized this blessing in an article published in the Christian Century some time ago. He recalled: "The first impression of a contented ideal in life and an idea that fitted it to make it practical, that I can remember, centers about the habit of family worship, which was established by my father and mother on their wedding-day. The regular reading of the Bible, the singing of a simple hymn, the kneeling down in the family circle while Father offered the morning prayer, praying for us often by name, the quiet moment of meditation that followed before we went out of that little log house on the Dakota prairie to begin the day's work on the ranch, produced lasting results in my thinking and profoundly influenced my conduct. ... In numberless cases of temptation, I recall, it was the memory of our family circle at prayer time, with Father asking for God's blessing on 'Charley' and 'Alice' and 'Ward' and 'Agnes,' that kept me from the shame of an unclean experience and helped me to escape the tormenting memories that several of my school and university classmates have confessed to me are a part of their heritage. Anything that had in it the power to influence a boy's physical passions and direct for an entire lifetime his daily ambitions and ideals must have some astonishing and unquestionable value. The religious atmosphere we breathed every day while we were children was the birthplace and the nourishment of whatever ideals in life I have ever had."

John G. Paton, heroic missionary to the cannibals of the South Sea Islands, recounts the blessing he received through the family prayer in the thatched cottage which he called home. In his life's story (John G. Paton, D.D., An Autobiography, p. 21) we read: "How much my father's prayers... impressed me I can never ex-plain, nor could any stranger understand. When, on his knees, and all of us kneeling round him in family worship, he poured out his whole soul with tears for the conversion of the heathen world to the service of Jesus and for every personal and domestic need, we, all of us, felt as if we were in the presence of the living Savior, and I learned to know and love Him as our divine Friend. As we rose from our knees, I used to look at the light on my father's face and wish I were like him in spirit, hoping that in answer to his prayers I might be privileged and prepared to carry the blessed Gospel to some portion of the heathen world."

Those petitions were answered, as were many others in behalf of the evangelization of the world. We may say that the first chapters in the history of many missions have been written at the family altar. Back of Bartholomew Ziegenbalg, first Protestant missionary to India's millions, was the pleading of his mother, who on her death-bed, maintaining her habitual prayer with her son, placed the Bible into his hands. The petitions of Christian parents in behalf of Christian Frederick Schwartz, a subsequent ambassador to India, recalled him from the highway of dissolute sin. It was the prayerful Christian home that made another remarkable contribution to the cause of the Christian ministry. In South Africa Andrew Murray reared a family of eleven children. Five of the six sons became ministers, and of the five daughters, four were married to ministers. Of the next generation, twenty-three of Andrew Murray's grandsons became ministers of congregations or missionaries in foreign fields. The family intercession of Dr. and Mrs. John Scudder arose in India, beseeching the Almighty that their sons and daughters might be "not Christians only, dear Lord, but missionaries, every one, if it be Thy will." With the exception of one son, who died while in college, all their children returned to the foreign mission field. Indeed, this unusual family in three generations has produced approximately forty missionaries. When Dr. Scudder was asked to explain this remarkable missionary zeal, he replied: "The only explanation I can give is that the children were literally prayed into the Kingdom by their mother. She was accustomed to spend the birthday of each child in all-day prayer for him. And God answered her prayers."

Of the blessings which may follow family worship, Paton cites the following instance: "Blessed to others as well as to ourselves was the light of such an example. I have heard that in long after-years the worst woman in Thorthorwald, then leading an immoral life, but since changed by the grace of God, was known to declare that the only thing that kept her from despair and from the hell of suicide was when in the dark winter nights she crept close up underneath my father's window and heard him pleading in family worship that God would convert the sinner from the error of wicked ways and polish him as a jewel for the Redeemer's crown.' 'I felt,' said she, 'that I was a burden on that good man's heart, and I knew that God would not disappoint him. That thought kept me out of hell and at last led me to the only Savior.'" (L. c., pp. 14, 15.)

The best-known commentary written in the English language is Matthew Henry's. That explanation of the Old and New Testaments originated at the family altar. Of Matthew Henry's father, Philip Henry, we are told: "He and his wife constantly prayed together morning and evening. He made a conscience of family worship and abounded in it. He said to his children and friends: 'Be sure to look to your sacred duty; keep that up for whatever you do; one cannot prosper in the neglect of it. Apostasy generally begins at the closet door.'" As the father read and explained the Scriptures day after day, his son Matthew and others in the family-altar circle recorded his interpretations, and these notes formed the basis of the commentary which has been more widely distributed than any other English exposition of the Scriptures.

Entirely apart from such spiritual blessings is a certain cultural by-product, to which Ruskin alludes as he pays this tribute to his mother's insistence upon the reading of the Scriptures: "My mother forced me by steady toil to learn long chapters of the Bible by heart as well as to read it every syllable through, aloud, hard names and all, from Genesis to Revelation, about once a year; and to that discipline, patient, accurate, and resolute, I owe not only a knowledge of the Book, but much of my general power of taking pains and the best part of my taste in literature. After our chapters (from two to three a day, according to their length, the first thing after breakfast, and no interruption from servants allowed, none from visitors, who either joined in the reading or had to stay up-stairs, and none from any visitings or excursions except real traveling) I had to learn a few verses by heart or repeat, to make sure I had not lost something of what was already known."

How the family altar helps in building the Church is remarkably illustrated by two impressive examples. About two hundred years ago Thomas Boston, a Scotch preacher, was called to a congregation in the slums, which apparently had little hope of continuance and blessing. The services were poorly attended, and his ministry seemed in vain. After all else seemed to fail, Boston resolved to bring Christ into the homes of his parishioners; for he felt that then he could bring his parishioners home to Christ. For thirty years, night after night, he went into the crowded rooms of his people, and there, in the family circles of the poor, he taught his members how to pray and how to read the Scriptures. In consequence his church revived and flourished with unprecedented growth. In this policy he followed the example of Richard Baxter, about a hundred years before his time, who also was called to a difficult charge in Kidderminster, a congregation made up of impoverished weavers. Baxter was twenty-six years old when he took over the work with a small group of members who had remained loyal. With undaunted spirit he went straight into the homes of Kidderminster and showed the carpet-weavers how to establish family worship. He was forty-five years old when he left, but in these nineteen years during which he ceaselessly stressed the importance of family prayers, Kidderminster was transformed. It was said that, when Baxter began his work, he found entire streets with only a home or two in which family prayers were spoken. When he was called away, on the same streets only a family or two could be found that did not worship Christ daily. As both Boston and Baxter built the church by building its homes, so the clergy today will do well to lay this family base.

When the statue of Rufus Choate, one of the ablest of American statesmen and lawyers, was unveiled in Boston, the eloquent tribute which Joseph Choate, his distinguished nephew, paid to his memory, contained this testimony to the stimulus of family Bible-reading: "He [Rufus Choate] came of a long line of pious and devout ancestors, whose living was as plain as their thinking was high. It was from father and mother that he derived the flame of intellect, the glow of spirit, and the beauty of temperament that were so unique. And his nurture to manhood was worthy of the child. It was 'the nurture and admonition of the Lord. From that rough pine cradle, which is still preserved in the room where he was born, to his premature grave, at the age of fifty-nine, it was one long course of training and discipline of mind and character without pause or rest. It began with that well-thumbed and dog's eared Bible from Hog Island, its leaves actually worn away by the pious hands that had turned them, read daily in the family from January to December, in at Genesis and out at Revelation every two years. And upon this solid rock of the Scriptures he built a magnificent structure of knowledge and acquirement, to which few men in America have ever attained."

To those who waver in uncertainty as to the benefits of the family altar I direct this dozen of reasons for instituting home devotions:

1.  The family altar will enrich, elevate, and ennoble our homes, the relations between husband and wife, parents and children, as nothing else can.
2.  Family prayers will minimize domestic misunderstanding and when trouble arises will work quickly for peace and forbearance.
3.  The family altar, pointing to the complete self-denial and self-sacrifice of Christ, will help to stifle selfishness in us and promote forbearance, generosity, courtesy.
4.  Home worship will prove invaluable in emphasizing the Christian way of life and the verities of the Christian faith to the children in each family.
5.  Prayers in the morning will guide us through the day, and their blessings will strengthen us at work, in school, or at play.
6.  Prayers in the evening will invoke the angels' watchfulness over us and ours, affording light in the darkness and protection in our weakness.
7.  The family altar will strengthen us to withstand bravely the adversities of life, for it helps to found our homes on that Rock against which all trials and tempests will beat in vain.
8.  Family prayers will exert a blessed influence on friends who visit our homes or on guests who are sheltered within our walls.
9.  Prayerful homes will help to reenforce that righteousness which "exalteth a nation."
10. The family altar will mightily strengthen the work and the influence of the Church and its agencies throughout the world.
11. Prayerful homes will honor our heavenly Father and, in turn, be honored by Him.
12. Families that are fervent in the faith have a foretaste of the heavenly homeland even on earth and enjoy the assurance that in the prepared mansions they will be a part of "the whole family in heaven."

### THE SUPREME TRAGEDY

With the family altar radiating such blessing, it is one of the supreme tragedies of our modern home-life that its sustaining power is neglected. Christians today often show less interest in these devotions than the persecuted believers did in the days when Bible-reading was punished as heretical. In his autobiography Benjamin Franklin writes: "Our family was Protestant throughout the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal. They had an English Bible; and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened, open, with tapes under and within the cover of a joint stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its teet, where the Bible remained concealed under it as before." Today, when this risk has been eliminated, the apparitor would often walk in vain.

The questionnaire to which reference was made before, also asked: "If you do not have family devotion, please state here why not." The prevalent answer to this was, in effect: "We have no time when all can gather for this purpose." In the rush which dominates many of our homes the time element is a very vital factor. In the morning the daily scramble preceding the hurried exit from the home hardly leaves room for organized family worship. And when the last member of the household has returned in the evening, some of the others are already busy with their preparations for night's duties and pleasures.

Under these handicaps it is first of all necessary to make place for family worship. Since the reading of a portion of Scripture, the prayer, and then perhaps the singing of a few stanzas from a favorite hymn requires six or eight minutes at the most, few homes, however busy and complicated they are, will not be able to set aside this time. If no other way suggests itself, the members of the household can at least rise ten minutes earlier each morning. And at night the most appropriate occasion will doubtless present itself immediately after the evening meal. If we appreciate how incessant our gratitude to God should be, we shall be ready to accept any small inconveniences that may be involved. Luther, for whom each day was a strenuous struggle with all but overpowering responsibilities, who once paused to give us a picture of his home, its tables and benches, closets and window seats, piled high with correspondence and petitions and printer's proofs, and who had to dictate letters during his meals, was not so preoccupied that he could not worship with his own at the family altar. He writes: "Let him who can read take up each morning a psalm or other chapter in the Scriptures and study it for a time. This I do: when I rise with the children, I pray the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer, and some psalm besides." When he was hindered from attending church, he would preach to the children and the servants. These home sermons, which were later published, are now known as the House Postil and are replete with helpful suggestions for the strengthening of the home ties even today.

A grandson of Mrs. Washington, George Washington Parke Custis, says that it was the first President's custom at Mount Vernon to "read a sermon or some portion of the Bible to Mrs. Washington in the afternoon," after the regular church attendance on Sunday morning. He also states that, while President Washington was in Philadelphia, "in the evening the President read to Mrs. Washington in her chamber a sermon or some portion of the Sacred Writing." (Custis, Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington, p. 173.)

In the midst of his literary activities on Samoa, Robert L. Stevenson, long harassed by great fragility of health, not only took time to maintain family prayers, but also to summon the household and the neighborhood for daily worship. At the introduction to a volume of prayers written by this notable author, his widow writes: "With my husband, prayer, the direct appeal, was a necessity. When he was happy, he felt impelled to give thanks for that undeserved joy; when in sorrow or pain, to call for strength to bear what must be borne.

"Vailima lay up some three miles of continual rise from Apia and more than half that distance from the nearest village. It was a long way for a tired man to walk down every evening with the sole purpose of joining in family worship; and the road through the bush was dark and to the Samoan imagination beset with supernatural terrors. Wherefore, as soon as our household had fallen into a regular routine and the bonds of Samoan family life began to draw us closer together, Tusitala [the Samoan name of Steven-son, meaning 'story-teller'] felt the necessity of including our retainers in our evening devotions. I suppose ours was the only white man's family in all Samoa, except those of the missionaries, where the day naturally ended with this homely, patriarchal custom. The service began by my son's reading a chapter from the Samoan Bible. Tusitala followed with a prayer in English. Then came the singing of one or more hymns in the native tongue. Sometimes a passing band of hostile warriors, with blackened faces, would peer in at us through the open windows, and often we were forced to pause until the strangely savage, monotonous noise of the native drums had ceased; but no Samoan changed his reverent attitude."

Speaking in the House of Lords soon after the death of Lord Roberts, Lord Curzon read this excerpt from the last letter which the Field Marshal of Great Britain had written him: "We have had family prayers for fifty-five years. Our chief reason, besides worship, is that they bring the household together in a way that nothing else can." Even with heavy military routine and despite multiple interruptions, Lord Roberts was able to maintain these meditations day after day for more than half a century.

Mrs. Elias Compton, American Mother for 1939, told the National Broadcasting Company's Red Network audience: "People often say to me that they cannot find time in the morning for family prayers. We solved that problem by rising a few minutes earlier to begin the day rightly with thanksgiving. Only illness or an exceptional reason kept the family from assembling at prayers or meals.

In those moments when we knelt together, praying with and for each other, — for friends, for our country and for the world, - something was unconsciously fused into our very being which has been a lasting influence upon each of us. These moments created a bond of fellowship and a feeling of interdependence which exists today, even though thousands of miles may separate us."

It is the earnest appeal of the Church that, especially in newly established homes, the Christian husband and wife, pledged together "for better or for worse," will find time for Christ — full, reverent, appreciative time, even when home cares or social issues seem to crowd the daily calendar beyond its capacity — and assure themselves of the perpetual blessings and companionship of Him who must be the Third in every essentially happy union.

There should be time, too, for the few seconds required to invoke the benediction of God upon our food. It often takes a catastrophe to break down our mechanistic philosophy and to make us realize that "the eyes of all wait upon Thee, and Thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest Thine hand and satisfiest the desire of every living thing" (Ps. 145:15, 16). After Robinson Crusoe recovered from the illness that had brought him close to death's door, he wrote in his June 28 entry: "I walked about but was very weak and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper the next day. At night I made my supper of three of the turtles' eggs, which I roasted in the ashes and ate in the shell; and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, even as I could remember, in my whole life." If we would enumerate the constructive aspects of our retarded prosperity as our nation has experienced it, one of the most outstanding contributions which depressions have wrought would be the realization in some otherwise indifferent hearts that the three meals on the American daily table are not accidental or inevitable but the undeserved bestowal of God, who can give or withhold. With the conviction of this truth, grace at meals becomes a holy privilege.

King Alfonso V of Aragon is known to posterity as "the Magnanimous." Of consecrated Christian faith, he deplored the ingratitude of his courtiers in omitting grace at meals. They argued, as many people do today: "Why should we pray for what we already have? And why should we thank God for it when it is the king who supplies our food?" In order to teach those hard-grained materialists a lesson, he invited them to a special banquet, at which he, too, omitted the table prayer. During the courses a ragged, disheveled tramp strode into the palace dining-hall, seated himself at the royal table, and without a word of apology or explanation started to devour vast quantities of the king's food. A dozen of the courtiers rose to throw the wretch out; but the king intervened and told his knights: "You are very angry with this poor fellow because of his discourteous and ungrateful behavior. Yet he has done only what you do three times a day. In God's sight you must appear less worthy to Him than the beggar appears to me. When you go to your table every day, you never give a word of recognition to the King, the Father in heaven; and when you are satisfied, you go your way without a word of thanks for the Giver of all good. Do you suppose that God is less angry with you who are so unthankful than you are with the ungrateful tramp?"

### NO APOLOGIES FOR FAMILY PRAYERS!

Neither should we apologize for family prayer. When visitors are welcomed into the family circle, it is a contradiction of our Christian profession to omit the family worship. Henry Clay was once forced to stay overnight at a log cabin in his native Kentucky. Although the father had habitually exercised his paternal priesthood both morning and evening, the presence of the distinguished orator disturbed him. At last, when the sleepy children were becoming restless and Clay had refused an invitation to retire, the Kentuckian, urged on by his wife's pointed gestures, acknowledged that it was his custom to conduct family prayer and that Clay could either join or go to his quarters. The great statesman replied that he would prefer to participate, unless this was regarded as intrusive. After the father had finished with much embarrassment the Scripture-reading and prayer, Clay sympathetically told him: "My dear sir, never again feel the least hesitation in the discharge of your duty to God on account of the presence of man. I saw your embarrassment and remained on purpose that you might never feel it again. Remember that every man of sense will respect the individual who is not ashamed to acknowledge his dependence upon his Maker; and he deserves only contempt who can cherish any other feelings than reverence for 'the consecrated hour of man in audience with the Deity? I would rather know that the prayers of a pious man, no matter how humble his position in life, were ascending in my behalf than to have the wildest applause of listening Senators."

The faithful Boswell records a similar instance in which a solicitous host was disquieted by Dr. Johnson's presence at the time of family prayer. Boswell's condemnation of this overdelicate hesitancy is classic. He writes: "I said that the Doctor might sit in the library while we were at family worship. Mr. M'Aulay said he would omit it rather than give Dr. Johnson offense; but I would by no means agree that an excess of politeness, even to so great a man, should prevent what I esteem as one of the best pious regu-lations. I know nothing more beneficial, more comfortable, more agreeable, than that the little societies of each family should regularly assemble and unite in praise and prayer to our heavenly Father, from whom we daily receive so much good and may hope for more in a higher state of existence."

Many young people hesitate to establish their family altar because they regard practically all religious exercises as beyond their scope and ability. They share the feeling of inferiority expressed in the following confession recorded in The Real Home: "Ten years ago I boarded in the family of a pious woman whose husband was not religious. There was a daughter nineteen years of age, another of fourteen, and a son of ten. Every morning I heard that humble woman gather her family in the kitchen and read a chapter, verse by verse, in the Bible. Then, as I could not help listening, there was a peculiarity of service that mystified me.

"At last, one day, I asked if I might remain. She hesitated; her daughter blushed; but she said I could do so if I really desired it. So I sat down with the rest. They gave me a Testament, and we read a verse in turn. Then, kneeling on the floor, that mother began her prayer audibly, for her dear ones there, for her husband, and herself, and then, pausing a moment, as if to gather energy or wing her faith, uttered a tender, affectionate supplication for me.

"She closed, and her daughter began to pray. Poor girl, she was afraid of me. I was from college; I was her teacher; but she tremulously asked a blessing as usual. Then came the other daughter and at last the son, the youngest of that circle, who only repeated the Lord's Prayer, with one petition of his own.

"His 'Amen' was said, but no one arose. I knew on that instant they were waiting for me. And I, poor, prayerless I, had no word to say. It almost broke my heart. I hurried from the room, desolate and guilty.

"A few weeks only had passed when I asked their permission to come in once more; and then I prayed, too, and thanked my dear, patient Savior for the hope in my heart and the new song on my lips."

We shall do well to attain the ease and intimacy of prayer which marked the faith of Stephen Foster's mother. Her constant communion with God is described by another son in this glowing tribute: "No unkind word ever passed between any members of that family; for strife was repelled and anger washed away by the pure stream of love that emanated from her presence. Her discourses abounded in illustrations of the goodness of God and the necessity for recognizing the fact that dependence on Him alone constitutes the happiness of mankind. Sometimes she would say, almost abruptly, 'And now, my children, kneel down here and let us pray to our heavenly Father. Rising, her face resumed its sweet, sunny aspect, and everything went on as though it were the most natural thing in the world to fall down and worship God at any time." (Raymond Walters, Stephen Foster, Youth's Golden Gleam, pp. 111, 112.)

### A PROGRAM FOR HEARTHSIDE DEVOTIONS

No exceptional ability, no technical preparation, is required to express the sincerity of home prayer. For the benefit particularly of young people who are looking at marriage from the background of a home that never fully appreciated the blessings of the family altar, the following practical suggestions are offered:

1.  Let each devotion embrace at least the reading of a portion of Scripture, a prayer by one of the members of the household, and a prayer in unison. If time and circumstances permit, a few verses should be sung from the hymnal.
2.  Scriptural reading should be taken from the Bible, while the devotional exercises and the prayers may be read from any of many good devotional books. Usually it will be found that the books with devotional material for every day in the year are more valuable than those containing only prayers for the seven days of the week. Basic in all prayers should be the petition for the forgiveness of sin and the gratitude for Christ's redeeming grace. The spontaneous prayer from the heart of the father or the mother, mentioning the special and individual needs of the household and emphasizing the requests that crowd themselves into the family life, are of , course particularly beneficial, but for some the most difficult of all prayers. — Why is it that we are so often hesitant about discussing with our nearest relatives and kin those needs which are of such indescribable importance for the welfare of our soul?
3.  The devotional exercise should meet the understanding and the requirements of the younger members of the household.

Let no young husband or wife insist that, because family prayer has been neglected during their entire previous life, it is too late to introduce it after marriage. It is a definite requirement of the Scriptures that we "learn first to show piety at home" (1 Tim. 5:4). And in what way can piety be shown more directly and forcefully than in the sincere outpouring of hearts agitated by joy or sorrow in the common prayers and petitions of the family? How tragic is the confession of a mother who pleads in behalf of the family altar in the Christian Observer: "One of the greatest regrets of my life is that my eldest son (eighteen years old) passed to his reward without having heard his father's and mother's voice lifted in prayer to God at the family altar. O fathers and mothers, would to God I could tell you how intensely I feel the sinfulness of this neglect!"

### "AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE"

The avalanche of domestic misunderstanding that starts insignificantly from some small, selfish act and soon assumes devastating proportions can be averted only by the sincerity of resolution which renews Joshua's promise of old, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Josh. 24:15). A home built on this resolution may be shaken by the storms of unemployment, illness, suffering, and death; but it will have a peace which a self-indulgent world knows not, for it will have Christ. Its walls may witness some of the tragedies bred by survivals of selfishness; but self-sacrifice and forbearance will triumph, for Christ will hallow the relation of husband to wife and of parents to children. In that home, sons and daughters, rising above sense-level pleasures to the more abundant life, will have the spiritual basis on which achieving careers may be built, the foundation knowledge for which St. Paul immortalizes the memories of Eunice and Lois (2 Tim. 3:15). That home, in short, will be a pillar support for the arch of national wel-fare, a fortress of Christ's faith, and a haven of spiritual peace for all who are sheltered within its walls. For that home, that altar-building, Scripture-searching home, and that alone, is the home of abiding happiness.
