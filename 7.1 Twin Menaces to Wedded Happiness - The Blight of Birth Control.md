## 7.1 THE BLIGHT OF BIRTH CONTROL

Be fruitful and multiply - Gen. 1:28

Unnmistable trends toward the diminutive mark this colossal age of Empire State Buildings, Boulder Dams, and public-relief billions. A generation or two ago, in the overworked yesteryear, a more complacent public pondered over three-volume novels in quarto. It listened patiently to sermons that were half over when, like Stevenson's voluble cleric, the preacher might say, "And now, thirteenthly, my brethren." Then men of parts smoked long stogies as they ruminated on two-column editorials. It was a large world, and it took things in a large way. Today the novel has tapered down to the novelette, and this, too cumbersome, has given way to the short short story. Churches feature sermonets. The typical citizen lights a cigaret and, reading as he rushes from a kitchenette breakfast, he skims over an editorialette. with reading-time reduced to fifty seconds.

### SHRINKING FAMILIES

The most telltale evidence of the fact that in this age of Titan ambitions moderns are conceiving of life in the miniature is the diminutive family. Two investigators at the University of Wisconsin, Baber and Ross, have shown in their studies, The Changes in the Size of American Families in One Generation (p. 26), that, "whereas the fertile families of a generation ago averaged 5.44 children each, the corresponding average for the present generation is but 3.35 a family, a decrease of nearly 40 per cent in a single generation. When allowance has been made for the childless families, the absolute rate of decrease is such that the second generation after the present one will produce families with an average of 1.05 children, or one third of the minimum necessary for the continuance of the race."

Well-nigh universal is this decline in birth-rate. In Great Britain a new low percentage was reached in the first quarter of 1932, when the number of births per 1,000 decreased to 15.3. things continue as at present for a sufficient length of time," a British sociologist warns, "our population will die out. The process will be slow, but there would be a considerable decrease before A. D. 2000.". Despite these warnings only 610,850 children were born in England and Wales in 1937, reaching an all-time minimum of 14.8 per thousand population.

The Registrar-General of Scotland reluctantly recorded that 1931 saw the lowest birth-rate in that country, with 19 births per 1,000 population; but 1937 brought a further decrease to 17.9.

In France, where in 1929 the number of deaths exceeded the births, there was a decrease from 21.4 in 1920 to 18.1 in 1930 and to 17 in 1936.

Conversely, Manila's Bureau of Health reports for the year 1931 a new high of 56.65 births per 1,000 population. Among the world's large cities Madras comes next with 40.5. If we contrast with this the ominous fact that in 1931 the Berlin ratio was the lowest in the large cities, dwindling to 8.7 per 1,000, we see that heterogeneous Manila reproduced itself seven times as fast as Nordic Berlin. Nor is the Berlin figure isolated in vital statistics; for in 1931 the ten largest German cities, a statistical bulletin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company informs us, showed a birth decline of more than 10 per cent over 1930. Since the advent of the Hitler régime, however, with its official protest against childlessness and its financial aid for parents, many sections of the Third Reich have been strengthened by an increasing birth-rate. The German rate dropped from 29 per 1,000 population in 1911 to 17.5 in 1930, while in 1937 the figure rose to 18.8. On May 5, 1939, Nazi officials declared that during 1938, while the marriage rate had increased only from 9.1 per 1,000 to 9.4, the birth rate had risen from 18.8 to 19.7 per 1,000.

In our own country the 1917 birth-rate was 24.7 per thousand. Ten years later, in 1927, this figure dropped to 20.6; and after another decade, in 1937, the American birth-rate figure was 17. A graphical summary of the decrease in our American birth-rate presents these figures: In 1850, exclusive of slaves, the average size of the American family was 5.66; in 1860, similarly excluding slaves, it was 5.3; in 1870 it dropped to 5.1; in 1890 it declined to 4.9; in 1900 to 4.7; in 1920 to 4.3; and in 1930 it reached the lowest level of all times, 3.4. Fewer children were born in the United States during 1933 than in any year since the start of the twentieth century.

A cross-section of our metropolitan life shows that every one of the fourteen largest American cities experienced a decided drop in the birth-rate. During 1931 there was, for example, a decrease of 22 per cent in Boston, of 17 per cent in Detroit, and of 6 per cent in Pittsburgh. The 1933 birth-rate for Massachusetts was 14.7, the lowest figure since the complete records were started in 1841.

The slump in the American birth-rate may also be illustrated by the United States Census Bureau's analysis of the 1932 vital statistics of New York State. This showed that of all large cities of the Empire State only Utica recorded an increase in birth-rate for 1932. The percentage for New York City declined from 16.2 per 1,000 to 15.3.

The shrinkage in American families may be graphically visualized in a statement issued on October 4, 1935, by the United States Census Bureau. Startling is the statistical fact that one out of every three married couples in the United States is childless. This figure refers only to "normal" families. If families broken by divorce or death are included, the percentage of childlessness is still more alarming. In 1930, within the normal group, there were 23,352,990 couples, of which 7,447,328 were childless; 5,254,863 families had one child; 4,246,459 had two children; 2,650,730, three children; 3,753,610, four or more.

Many and contradictory attempts have been made to explain these drastic declines, but no reasonable doubt remains that the most pronounced factor in the diminution of our American families is the employment of artificial means to restrict the size of the family, - birth control, as the term is commonly understood.

This is not a pleasant subject for investigation and discussion, but it is one of the most vital issues in our modern life; and its consequences directly involve individual and national welfare. To decline the discussion of its admittedly wide prevalence is merely to adopt the alleged head-hiding gesture of the ostrich. To hesitate in formulating a clear-cut statement of the entire issue because of the intimacy of the relevant facts or because the presentation may suggest procedures which might otherwise be unknown, is simply to minimize the wide-spread sophistication of youth and to close one's eyes upon entering a drug store; for in thousands of communities throughout our country information on birth restriction is so obtrusively advertised that those who have eyes to see cannot escape it.

We will not be expected to describe or define the scope and means of birth control; besides, there are only few phases of modern marriage in which there has been such a wide-spread understanding. In a questionnaire sent out by the Rockefeller Bureau of Social Hygiene it was shown that of 992 married women who answered certain questions, 897 expressed knowledge of birth-control methods. Prof. E. R. Groves, in Marriage, shows (p. 360) that of a class of 46 college seniors only 10 gained their knowledge of birth-control methods while at college. With the exception of two students, who answered evasively, all the rest, two thirds of the class, acquired this information during the high-school years or, in three instances, while at grammar school.

In addition, the specific methods of birth control are suggested by courses given in some of our American colleges. The Conference on Education for Marriage and Family Social Relations that reports in the Journal of Social Hygiene, January, 1936, p. 29, protests: "It is rather surprising to find 15 of 105 courses in some of the 225 American colleges that offer instruction on marriage and family life giving an hour to 'technique of birth control, a topic which is illegal in many States and generally is regarded as suitable only for medical schools."

What, then, are the reasons advanced for the endorsement of birth control and for the elimination of the Federal statutes which heretofore have made the spreading of birth-restriction information illegal?

### THE OVERPOPULATION BUGABOO

The first line of attack usually starts with the assertion that, without placing some restriction on the normal propagation of the human race, the world will soon be overpopulated.

Actually this claim plays little part in birth control. Entirely different motives are decisive. Edwin Grant Conklin of Princeton, in his Heredity and Environment (p. 320), admits: "No one denies that the chief motive for limiting the size of families is personal comfort and pleasure rather than the welfare of the race." A volume of President Hoover's Committee on Social Trends, issued May 14, 1933, recognizes that birth control is a factor in accelerating the marriages of young people. They are more willing to marry now, the report concludes, than they were when they were "reasonably certain that they would have children born at rather regular and frequent intervals."

The overpopulation bugaboo has been urged for generations, but especially since the days of Thomas R. Malthus, an English clergyman, who lived a hundred years ago. Having surveyed the toil and turmoil of human existence, he wrote his Essay on the Principles of Population, claiming that, since the world's population appeared to be increasing more rapidly than the available food supply, some decisive check upon the human growth was necessary. In 1798 he prophesied that by 1898 England and Wales would be overcrowded by 112,000,000 people. The actual figure fell short of his estimate by a mere 80,000,000!

In spite of Father Coughlin's unguarded assertion to the contrary, Malthus never advocated birth control; but its champions have seized upon his doctrine to demonstrate the necessity of their hypotheses. Fifty years ago Darwin showed that in some regions civilized man had increased by 100 per cent in two and a half decades, and he asserted that at this rate within a few centuries the human race would so multiply that on the whole surface of the globe four men would be crowding each other on every square yard of dry land. Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, with rare powers of prophecy and against every scientific survey, predicts that the present world's population will be doubled every sixty years or less. He summarizes: "There is only one solution - the scientific control of the birth-rate." Dean Inge, "gloomy" exponent of a similar pessimism, asserts: "There is no doubt that there is a limit to the number of people that can be supported in the world; for if the birth-rate had no restrictions upon it in any part of the world, that limit would be reached in less than a century." Prof. Edward M. East. biologist of Harvard University, warns that the day of reckoning is not far distant and that some of our grandchildren will live to see this age of overcrowding.

The extremes to which Neo-Malthusianism leads may be illustrated by the overproduction specter of Henry Pratt Fairchild in the New Republic (October 16, 1929): "If the population of the earth were to continue to increase at the rate that prevailed during the period 1906 to 1911, at the end of 10,000 years there would be, allowing one and one half square feet of standing-room per person, 60,570,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times more people than there was room for. Of course, this is an impossibility. Something must and will intervene to forestall it. The whole question is, what?"

Fairchild's answer is: "Birth control." Our answer is: "God." While a mechanistic philosophy may compute formidable tables of population increase and brandish them before gullible minds, the student of history as well as the simplest child of God knows that divine Providence cannot be eliminated. As St. Paul told the philosophers of Athens, God in heaven "hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation" (Acts 17:26).

Oysters know nothing of artificial birth control; and within five generations the unrestricted offspring of a single prolific blue-point, if packed ever so closely together, would pile up a bulk eight times as large as the entire globe. Biologists tell us that a normal oyster in the course of its existence produces 16,000,000 young. If these, in turn, could reproduce to the same astonishing degree, before many decades had passed, the solar system would be disrupted. But bivalve as well as human reproduction and survival is more than a simple matter of geometric growth.

The actual crisis in America is not that of an alarming human expansion but the prospects of a startling decrease. Louis I. Dublin and Alfred Lotka, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company statisticians, have predicted a stationary population of about 150,000,000 by 1960-1970. Others have posited a maximum population of about 140,000,000 by 1945, to be followed by a few decades of fixed population and then by a decrease. E. O. Baker, census expert of the United States Department of Agriculture, says: "The number of births today is sufficient only to maintain a stationary population of about 140,000,000, having the present average age of fifty-nine at death. Although this average age of death may increase slightly, it appears unlikely that the United States will ever have more than 160,000,000 people unless the number of births or of immigration increases."

President Hoover's Research Committee on Social Trends substantiates these results in a most remarkable way. In the Review of Findings (1933, p. xx) we meet these indicative statements: "Manufacturers who try to estimate future markets have been expecting a population of 140,000,000 by 1940; but the calculations of our contributors, based on information not presented in the decennial censuses, show that the declining rate of increase has been particularly striking since 1923 and that hardly more than 132 or 133 millions are to be expected by 1940. As our statisticians look further into the future, they see possibilities of still greater declines in growth, with the probability of a stationary population. They show that we shall probably attain a population between 145,000,000 and 190,000,000 during the present century, with the probability that the actual population will be nearer the lower figure than the higher. Such a prospect is radically different from that predicted a generation or even a decade ago." (Our italics.)

A similar change of prediction is conceded by Dr. Warren S. Thompson and Dr. P. K. Whelpton, investigators of the Scripps Foundation for Research in Population Problems, of Miami University, Oxford, Ohio. Writing in the New York Times, March 18, 1934, they declare: "It is now abundantly clear that most of the estimates of our future population made prior to about five years ago are going to prove considerably too high." They admit that the birth-rate drop has been more rapid "than was anticipated, even by the initiated." "All indications," they warn, "point to the approaching end of population growth during the current phase of our national life." Their investigations show the probability of a stationary population within two or three decades "at somewhere between 135,000,000 and 145,000,000."

Nor is the Neo-Malthusian worry regarding an inadequate food supply justified. The United States Department of Agriculture states that in 1938 only 350,000,000 acres were devoted to the production of food (for home consumption and support), and that 670,000,000 acres remained for utilization. Carrying this to the efficient extreme accepted by the Japanese, who are able to maintain one person on the products of an acre, it may be said that a total population of 1,020,000,000 could be supported by the arable acreage of the United States at the present rate of agricultural yield.

There is no reason to suppose that this rate of production is stable and must be restricted to a present minimum. When economists place the saturation point of the United States population at about 300,000,000, we may well remind ourselves that our natural resources are so bountiful that it is not reasonable to define any upper limit of productivity. Ways and means of increasing food harvests which our forebears could not anticipate have been given to us through steam, electricity, machinery, and the prodigious research of soil and crop experts. Advanced farming and selective breeding have recorded astounding conquests.

The late William D. Showalter, Sc. D., editor of the National Geographic Magazine, draws a drastic picture of contrasts to show that "what was once the most powerful scientific argument for birth control has been made invalid by economic facts." He writes: "It has been my privilege to see the original potato plant that grew in the highlands of Peru. The smallest tuber that ever flourished in a down-East truck garden is a prize-winner, both in quality and quantity, beside the original potato of the Andes region. Likewise it has been my privilege to see the original corn of the Andean highlands. The meanest nubbin that ever grew in an Iowa corn row would command the blue ribbon beside it. A few years ago I had occasion to attend some of the commissary accounts of Washington's army. The heaviest steer I could find as having been delivered weighed 450 pounds. Last year, in rambling about Southern Maryland, I found traces of a historic colonial cow, the record-holding bovine of her day. Her owner decided to rechristen her when she broke the Southern Maryland record, so as to perpetuate her wonderful flow of milk at each milking. And so she was called Five Pints."

On February 12, 1936, Carnation Ormsby Butter King was crowned champion of the bovine world. In contrast to Five Pints this cow averaged 105 pounds of milk daily for 380 days. She weighs 1,704 pounds and is the first cow to give over 38,000 pounds of milk per year. As recently as 1897 the champion cow in point of butter production was Belle Sarcastic, with an annual yield of 902.10 pounds. Now, through scientific breeding, a strain of Holsteins has been perfected that in the record-breaking development of Carnation Ormsby Butter King reached an annual production of 1,752.5 pounds, an increase of almost 100 per cent in thirty-nine years. While the average cow in the United States today gives about 6,000 pounds of milk in a year, there is no reason why the average production should not reach 10,000 pounds. A professional breeder of Holstein Fresians in the State of Washington writes: "The principles of breeding and feeding which are being developed by progressive breeders and which have resulted in the enormous increase which we witness today in milk production have not readily been adopted by the average dairyman."

Authorities in New York City tell us that sales of certified milk fell from 40,000 quarts in 1931 to 25,000 in 1935. In this connection Dr. John L. Rice, New York Health Commissioner, told a New York audience of scientists and milk company executives: "You can, of course, blame part of your trouble on the advocates of birth control, because the very marked decline in the birth-rate, from about thirty-five per 1,000 at the beginning of the century to thirteen per 1,000 now, cannot have failed to lessen the demand for a milk used almost entirely for infant-feeding. Even as late as 1915 there were over 140,000 births in this city; now, with a population 50 per cent larger, the number of births is only 100,000 per year."

The studies of Prof. Alonzo Taylor of the Food Research Institute of Leland Stanford University and Prof. Don D. Lescohier of the University of Wisconsin have shown that by growing alfalfa in the semiarid grazing plains, seven steers have been fattened where only one barely existed before; that the average litter of hogs, now 3.5 animals, should be systematically increased to 4 or 5, this alone offering 64 pounds of meat per person per year for the maximum estimated population of 1980.

With four European countries, taken collectively, yielding in seven important crops about 41 per cent more bushels an acre than the average of out country; with the possibility of tropical agriculture in the offing, of which Dr. Bailey K. Ashford, hook-worm-eradicator in Puerto Rico, says: "When we eliminate illiteracy, malaria, yellow fever, hookworm, and similar conditions from the life of tropical populations, we may set loose possibilities of agricultural output beyond our present expectation"; with the production of synthetic food making rapid and surprising advances, we need not fear that the coming generations need hover uncertainly on the verge of starvation.

Fifteen years ago F. G. Tryon and Lyda Mann conducted an inquiry into the natural resources of the nation and reported that "our petroleum reserves are now being exploited at a rate which cannot possibly be maintained for twenty years, from all that we know now." With half of their period of respite passed, the utter fallacy of their prediction is shown by the semistagnation into which the oil industry has dropped, with gasoline in lavish superabundance.

It is ironical that birth control should receive its strongest endorsement at a time when surplus crops have helped to arrest our national prosperity and to precipitate a financial crisis. The world's markets have been glutted with grains, vegetables, fruits, and foods. The Federal Government bought millions of bushels of surplus wheat; oranges by the ton rotted on the ground; hundreds of thousands of apples were thrown into the Columbia River; wide fields of berries were left unpicked; car-loads of Alaska salmon were dumped into the Pacific; pigs were slaughtered for fertilizer. While birth-control agitators chant the dirge of imminent starvation, the cornucopia of productivity overflows.

### PREVENTION OF INFANT MORTALITY

A second claim in behalf of birth control insists that it operates for the advancement of childhood, particularly now by preventing a high rate of infant mortality. Mrs. Margaret Sanger, one of eleven children of a militant atheist, birth-control leader and recipient of Town Hall Club Medal, in My Fight for Birth Control presents her picture of these underprivileged, rickety, tubercular children: "As I stood at the window and looked out, the miseries and problems of that sleeping city arose before me in a clear vision like a panorama: crowded homes, too many children, babies dying in infancy, baby nurseries, children neglected and hungry, children working in cellars, children aged six and seven pushed into the labor market to earn a living, another baby on the way, still another, yet another, a baby born dead - great relief, an older child dies — sorrow, but nevertheless relief — insurance helps, a mother's death."

Less dramatic are the results of the studies made by Dr. Alice Hamilton (assistant professor of industrial medicine at Harvard University) among 1,600 foreign-born families in Chicago. Comparing the families of eight children and over with the families of four children and under, Dr. Hamilton found that the former averaged 267 deaths to every thousand births as against 118 in the smaller families.

Henry Pratt Fairchild, sociologist of New York University, summarizes this claim (I.c.) in the dictum: "Birth control avoids the frightful toll of mortality, particularly of infants, that is inevitably consequent upon an unrestricted birth."

Like other claims for birth control, this contention first exaggerates and then makes the numerous family responsible for a condition in which the number of children may play no part. Dr. Arnold H. Kegel, former commissioner of health for the city of Chicago, does not agree with Dr. Hamilton's figures. He shows that the children in the small families of the Gold Coast of that city are less likely to reach the age of one year than the children born in the Ghetto, the thickly settled twenty-fourth ward with its large families. There the population is 62,000 persons to one square mile; yet the death-rate of infants is lower than on the Gold Coast, with a population of 52,242 persons to an area of 1.64 miles. Dr. Helen Gamgee made a study of 500 very poor families in Holland and learned that the health of the children was better in the families with five children and more, than in those having less than five.

Besides, this objection originates in a wrong point of view. Not all children who die in early infancy lose their lives because of an alleged inherited weakness found in overburdened mothers. Other important factors are the unfortunate influences of infant environment. Birth-control enthusiasts could offer a truly constructive help to the sound development of the race if, instead of trying to restrict the number of children, they would dedicate their organized efforts to the relief of the distressing conditions provoked by the greedy grasp of human avarice. Worthy of practical endorsement is an editorial conclusion in the Medical Times and Long Island Medical Journal: "Far better than birth control would be such a reordering of our economic life as to make it possible for people to have more children and rear them in keeping with their normal and proper needs."

### RETARDATION OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT

Even if the children in these large families survive infancy, we are further warned, they are under other handicaps. Social studies in tenement homes are cited to show that in the small families of four or less the children were allowed their freedom after school, while in large families, averaging seven children, the latter were obliged to sew on coats or make artificial flowers.

The impression rules in some circles that homes in which reduced circumstances or even poverty prevails cannot be morally good or "civilized" homes. A remark which may be classified by history in the same category as Marie Antoinette's "If they have no bread, let them eat cake!" is J.P. Morgan's assertion during the prematurely killed 1936 Senate Munitions Committee's Investigation. After telling Senator Bone of Washington that in the World War "we saved our souls and saved civilization," the American banker, who helped to finance the hostilities, declared: "If you destroy the leisure class, you destroy civilization." Inquiring reporters later bombarded Mr. Morgan for a definition of "leisure class." Never hesitant in his answer, the tycoon declared: All who "can afford to hire a maid." He estimated that there were "perhaps 30,000,000 families" in this class and explained: "Well, I think that if the housemother has to do all the cooking and all the washing and bring up a family, she doesn't have much time to be civilized and educate her children."

Mr. Morgan's "30,000,000" was wrong, and statisticians soon pointed out definitely that there were fewer than 2,000,000 housemaids in America. Even more glaring was the insistence of the financier that a mother who tends to all the duties of her household can hardly be civilized and take a practical interest in the education of her children. As a matter of historical fact it was the hard-working, middle-class mother without help of a servant who gave our country leaders in almost every walk of life. The passions of discontented multitudes can be aroused no more easily than by such stupid utterances. People are entitled to demand: If, in one short statement like this, a man can contradict all history (which shows that the leisure class has often contributed to the decay of the nations, while the hard-working, honest, frugal, middle-class homes, sans hired maid, have always been the moral backbone of their age), his judgment and conclusions on other matters may also well be subjected to serious question.

Carried through to their logical inference, these misguided proposals would ultimately restrict parenthood to the wealthy and prohibit those unable to support children from reproducing. This spirit of discrimination, besides being basically absurd, is un-American and unchristian. If the poor had been denied the right to have families, most of the niches in our Hall of Fame would be empty. There would have been no Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Mary Lyons, Henry Clay, James Garfield, not to mention a host of other illustrious leaders who have found that poverty and everything it involves — cramped living quarters, lack of educational facilities, early years of toil — have not diminished the opportunities for success.

Of late the charge is repeatedly raised that the families on relief are unusually prolific and that in the interests of public economy and their own welfare the size of these families should be restricted. Dr. S. A. Stouffer, professor of social statistics at the University of Chicago, speaking before a meeting of the Five-State Regional Conference on Birth Control in St. Louis on December 2, 1935, openly expressed doubt that government aid has increased the birth-rate. He asserted that no conclusive figures had been presented to indicate that the type of families on relief "would have had fewer babies under other conditions." (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, December 3, 1935.)

Turning to the slogan "Fewer children and better children," it can be demonstrated that the morality and the achievement of children do not decline with the growth of the family. Large families sometimes become social liabilities, it is true; but so have families with no children or just one child.

In an illuminating contribution published in the Proceedings of the National Conference in Social Work, Boston, 1930, Joanna C. Colcord writes on "Strength of Family Life" in a way which offers little comfort to birth controllers. She shows that homes with larger families seem to have more stable children than those in which the lone child is spoiled by maternal indulgence. Similarly, in families where the battle of life is real and earnest, where constant frugality is demanded in the distribution of the family income, there seems to be a rugged independence for which wealth can offer no compensation. Here the children are often reared on principles of discipline and training which few much more fortunately situated homes can attain.

In Can Delinquency be Measured? (Columbia University Press, 1936) Dr. Sophia M. Robison explodes the myth that poverty is an index to delinquency. This social authority concludes that severe want is not a decisive factor in youthful crime. The figures contained in this report show that for the year 1930 as many children from families with incomes of $50 a week or more were registered for probation as from homes with incomes of $25 a week or less. Well does Dr. Robison ask: "If poverty were the decisive factor in causing delinquent behavior, as it is sometimes claimed, what factor would account for the large number of children reared in poverty who are not known as delinquents? And how might one explain the misdeeds which the rest of us, reared in middle-class and well-to-do families, would acknowledge now that we know the danger of punishment is past?"

Dr. Ellsworth Huntington, research associate at Yale Univer-sity, writing in the Yale Scientific Magazine, throws a bombshell into the birth-control camp by declaring: "The popular notion that children are benefited when families are limited to two is completely wrong so far as Yale College graduates are concerned. The bigger the family, the more likely a boy is to succeed in college." He then offers this thought-provoking compilation: "A study of 1,700 men who were graduated from Yale College in the classes of 1922 to 1926 answers this question: How about the children? Are they not much better off in small families than in large? The standing of these men in activities of all kinds during their college careers was compared with the number of their brothers and sisters. In order to obtain a homogeneous group from nearly the same level, those whose fathers were college graduates were treated separately.

"Here are the astonishing results: The classroom work for the entire four years of college shows a well-nigh perfect gradation from relatively low marks on an average among those who were the only children of their parents up to a fairly high average among those coming from families of six or more. In non-athletic activities outside the classroom the case is similar, although not quite so clear. The students from families with five, six, or more children decidedly excel those from the smaller families in literary, dramatic, religious, and musical activities, in managing athletic teams, in student government, and the like. In athletics there is a most extraordinary regularity in the way in which those from the larger families take a greater part and are more likely to be leaders than are those from the smaller families."

Dr. Barton C. Hirst spoke at the 1933 meeting of the American Medical Association and admitted that it is doubtful whether "the pampered child and a half of the American family is better than the child of a former generation with eight or nine brothers and sisters."

Among eighty of the most eminent men that the human race has produced in the last century and a half, four — Thackeray, Hamil-ton, Ruskin, and R. L. Stevenson — were the only sons of their parents, while many of the other seventy-six were members of large families. Enrico Caruso and Guimar Novaes each had eighteen brothers and sisters; Benjamin Franklin, sixteen; John Marshall, fourteen; Peter the Great and Franz Schubert, thirteen; Napoleon, twelve; Samuel Adams, Walter Scott, and James Fenimore Cooper, eleven; Lord Nelson and Irving, ten; Webster and Carlyle, nine; Grover Cleveland, eight; Jefferson and Dickens, seven; Clay, Longfellow, Bryant, Wagner, and Mozart, six. The debt which the world owes to the mothers of these generously proportioned families is an obligation which birth-control advocates should recognize instead of hurling the darts of sarcasm against the courageous, self-denying women who gladly met the high requirements of motherhood.

If children in large families are not always granted full opportunities of life, the source of this discrimination is not to be sought in the size of the family but in man's social inhumanity and grasping greed. Modern social legislation should enact provisions to make the birth and rearing of children less expensive. Income-tax exemption for offspring should be increased; pay-rolls should be readjusted and sealed for married and unmarried workers. As in Germany, Federal aid should be extended in graduated scale to indigent families blessed with children. Why, then, should birth-control agitators not join the forces that are trying to rescue underprivileged families from the clutches of unsympathetic surround-ings? Why not support the Church, the one agency that has consistently championed the cause of children from the very days when its divine Founder caressed the infants and uttered His immortal "Suffer the little children to come unto Me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God" (Mark 10:14)? Social projects for the help of America's neglected childhood will produce much more lasting improvement than the sum total of all birth-control agitation.

### ELIMINATION OF UNFIT

A related claim insists that birth control is a powerful purifying agency towards eliminating the mentally, morally, and physically unfit. This widely advocated position is stated by Norman Haire, limitation leader and president of the International Birth Control Congress, London, 1922. He maintains: "The poor are kept in utter ignorance [of birth-control methods]. This should not be, because it gives rise to the breedings of an enormous number of mentally and physically defective beings, for whom the wealthier classes are obliged to contribute for maintenance. With the proper dissemination of birth-control information and instruction, there would be less feeble-mindedness and deformity."

Dr. Eric M. Matsner, medical director of the American Birth Control League, told the 1934 National Conference on Social Work in Kansas City that "75 per cent of the social ills about which the conference is meeting could be eliminated by intelligent practice of birth control." (New York Herald-Tribune, May 23, 1934.) But it has remained for Albert Wiggam (Sorry, but You're Wrong about It, p. 204) to soar to these dizzy heights in his advocacy of this error: "The alluring hope of race improvement through birth control lies in this: such students as Frederick Adams Woods, Ellsworth Huntington, Leon Whitney, and John Phillips have already developed abundant evidence to give us a secure conviction that voluntary birth control leads the able, unselfish, long-lived, intelligent, moral, and socially-minded members of the community to produce the larger families, while those less energetic and less endowed with gifts of nature reduce the number of their offspring. If this be true, then birth control is the most powerful moral agent of which the human race has ever become possessed. It will surpass in potency all the preachments of philosophers and theologians and all the efforts of the inspired writers and educators."

Every intelligent observer should concede that degenerate, mentally defective men and women, of whom medical science can definitely state that their offspring will be similarly deficient, should not be permitted to propagate. However, the application of this axiomatic principle may entail several almost inextricable difficulties. Where shall the line of elimination be drawn? Hereditary and eugenic research has shown the futility of absolute rules. Julian Huxley's unqualified ukase "The deformed should be prevented from having children" is characterized by the weakness of all generalizations. Eugenics knows many deformities not communicable by heredity. Even if these border-line parents could be definitely warned that their progeny would be defective, birth control would still be dangerous, because its methods often fail.

A primary observation suggests itself: undesirable parents ordinarily cannot be coerced into using birth-control methods. With this, the value of mechanical regulation as a process for race purification is drastically restricted.

The medical fraternity recognizes the futility of the exaggerated claims for childlessness as a population-purifier. Dr. Edward N. Ewer, former president of the California Medical Asso-ciation, ridiculed "clinics or other birth-control ballyhoo" as social panaceas and in his presidential address (April 28, 1926) told the California physicians: "Birth-controllers hold out birth restrictions as the remedy for crime, ignorance, poverty, underfeeding, bad housing, tuberculosis, degeneracy, alcoholism, and mental defectiveness. Crime in every form has greatly increased in spite of our falling birth-rate. The extravagant claims made for birth control by its votaries stamp it as the most pretentious as well as the most bizarre of the servist cults."

Even more recently, at the 1938 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Richmond, Virginia, Dr. Clyde E. Kerr of the Howe Laboratory of the Harvard Medical School "discounted birth control as a feasible answer to the insanity problem." He stated: "Contraception as yet has produced exactly the reverse of the differential birth-rates desired because contraception methods as practiced by morons fail, whereas they are quite effectively carried out by college graduates."

### MATERNAL RELIEF

Birth control, its devotees continue, offers mothers a new sense of freedom and an opportunity for self-expression which is quite impossible with a large family. Here we have the glitter and glamor of this delusion, the throbbing push behind the entire movement. The overworked picture of garrets crowded by broods of children and mildewed cellars housing impoverished families is often only of secondary concern. The chief difficulty is this, that many regard the coming of a child as a social and economic calamity, an unwelcome infringement upon the activities of husband and wife.

Birth control generally offers American women freedom of activity and expression. On the other hand, it is equally evident that this freedom entails a tremendous loss and robs womanhood of one of its greatest blessings. Emancipated champions of women's rights may sneer and challenge: "Why should a mother enslave herself through the care of her children?" The mother who answered the question, "What Price Baby-tending?" in the North American Review, July, 1930, gives a long and significant list of blessings that come with maternity. She enumerates: 1) "an incentive with greater driving power than any she has ever known"; 2) "the abiding sense that one is engaged in creative work"; 3) "the sense of being linked to the future"; 4) "self-discipline"; 5) "an emotional uprush quite as tremendous as first love."

The Scriptures call children "an heritage of the Lord" (Ps. 127:3), and for every normal woman the highest glory and sublimest distinction lie not in the repudiation of this heritage but in motherhood. The emptiness in the lives of childless wives and the grimness of disillusionment which often settles on their faces are telltale evidence of the prohibitive price paid for wilful exemption from a blessed privilege.

When a mother has six or eight children and these little ones are born too closely together, we are assured, the physical constitution will of necessity be impaired, since childbirth takes its toll in maternal health. This claim is based upon the assumption that the Christian Church and the opponents of birth control uniformly and unqualifiedly demand large families and insist that the children come in rapid succession. The Church has always refused to legislate in these matters and issue manifestoes on the minimum number of offspring. No intelligent opponent of limitation ever taught that the family must grow even if the mother's health collapses.

Most wives, however, are strong and healthy, and the birth of children, instead of producing a constitutional collapse, will bring a normal, healthful strengthening. The devoted wife of Nathaniel Hawthorne was an invalid, with a youth of pain behind her. In her protracted illness she wrote: "All my life long my word has been, 'This is well, and tomorrow it will be better; and God knows when to bring that tomorrow?" Her better tomorrow came through her marriage with Hawthorne. Seven times she was close to death, but seven times she survived. She gave the world three children and herself health, this high-souled woman, who declared: "Home, I think, is the great arena for woman; and there, I am sure, she can wield the power which no king or conqueror can cope with." Her experience has been amply illustrated by careful research into the status of mothers with large families. Dr. A. W. Ausems made an investigation of maternal health in 165 families that had averaged nine children each. Of these mothers 108 averaged 64.5 years at death, and 57 were still alive at the age of 64.3. There have been other studies by eminent physicians (Moore, The Case against Birth Control, p. 165 ff.) which show that despite the dangers of childbirth, mothers in these investigation groups who had six to eight children are more healthy than those who had only half as many or less.

### MISCELLANEOUS BIRTH-CONTROL ARGUMENTS

Birth control is also endorsed as a moral necessity. Its advocates allege that it counteracts the prenatal murder of children. Prof. Henry Pratt Fairchild (L.c.) declares: "It avoids the incredible pain and degradation of abortion, which remains such a blot upon our most advanced civilization that the only way, we can tolerate it is conventionally to shut our eyes to it."

We should never obviate one difficulty by introducing another. Christian ethics do not permit the selection of the lesser of two evils but demand the rejection of all that is morally reprehensible. Despite the far-flung dissemination of birth-control material, there has been no decrease in murders by abortion. The conclusion is obvious. In addition, the number of illegitimate births in the United States is steadily increasing. With the wide spread of contraceptive information, immorality and illegitimacy have both increased.

"Large families are an important cause of child labor"; so writes Guy Irving Burch in the New York Herald-Tribune of May 12, 1929. Before codes prohibiting child labor were intro-duced, Owen B. Lovejoy, former general secretary of the National Child Labor Committee, estimated that with family limitation in the poorer classes perhaps one third of all the working children in this country could be saved from drudgery. But in the exploitation of child labor the children in small families work as well as those in large families. The battle must be directed against twentieth-century murder of innocents, perpetuated in spite of all legal restriction. The elimination of child labor in recent legislation robs the contraceptive theory of one of its stock arguments.

Mrs. Margaret Sanger finds the absence of birth control a reason for the depression and suggests a two-year moratorium on babies, declaring: "Every child that is now born will only add to the financial distress of the family." However, any policy of halting a normal healthy growth in population is financially disastrous. Birth control, subversive at all times, is particularly insidious in days of financial retardation.

The 1936 convention of the American Medical Association heard its committee report that it found "no evidence available to justify the broad claim that dissemination of contraceptive information will improve the economic status of the lower-income groups."

Professor Fairchild advocates a moratorium on babies for a hundred years. He told luncheon guests at a Foreign Policy Association meeting in New York City on February 15, 1936, that the increase of population has been one of the major war causes, since crowded nations are forced to find additional territory for their enlarging numbers. Illogically he asserts: "Vigorous nations will fight when they find that the pressure of their growing population threatens the standard of living and raises the menace of hunger and starvation. A century of stationary population the world over would do more for the cause of international peace than all the treaties and pacts that could ever be signed, and the means of this objective is the wide dissemination and full accessibility of scientific birth-control facilities."

More recently the editor of The Woman's Home Companion (October, 1938) resurrected this overpopulation specter. He claims that for many decades experts have been convinced that "the human race is multiplying too fast for its own good." Germany's reaching out for new land; Italy's conquest of Ethiopia; Japan's annexation of China; India's famine, plague, and poverty; the anti-immigra-tion laws, — "all these are testimonies to the need of birth control." But, the editor continues, this is a problem for our country, too. Thirty-three per cent of our next generation, he holds, is born of the one sixth that is supported by relief. With cold judgment he asserts that "for many it would be better if they had not been born." And the conclusion is pointed: "Just as it is the physician's duty not only to cure but also to prevent disease, so also it is his right and duty to prevent birth where birth would be harmful. Ask your physician!" (His italics.)

This is cruel and illogical reasoning. Wars were waged during centuries of sparse population. With the world large enough for many more hundreds of millions and fertile enough to produce food and sustenance for additional billions, scientists should not advocate recourse to morally objectionable principles, but should champion more strenuously international cooperation and reapportionment of colonial territories.

Thus the arguments of the birth-control advocates, professional and amateur, follow in long array. As they are now surveyed in rapid summary, their weaknesses may be classified. First of all, they exaggerate, and their claims, set forth as uncontested truth, will not bear the light of unbiased investigation. Then, they make the large family a responsible factor for conditions of which it is fundamentally innocent. Finally, these arguments for artificial birth control disregard both the statements of Scripture and the results of contradicting sociological research.

### THE PHYSICAL PENALTY

While none of these alleged advantages for children, parents, and society have any foundation in fact, its claims are emphatically contradicted on decisive and far-reaching counts. First of all, it is physically injurious. When motherhood is deliberately avoided, we may have an explanation for many physical failings as well as for the constitutional weakening of many women. This verdict of Dr. Frederick McCann, surgeon at the Samaritan Hospital for Women in London and recognized gynecologist, declares with sweeping finality: The injurious effects of these contraceptive methods are at last appearing in medical literature... All known methods of contraception are harmful to the female; they only differ in being more or less so." (National Life, March, 1931.)

Sir Robert Armstrong Jones, British specialist, warns: "Birth control leads to lunacy in women. If you are to have birth control on a large scale, you will have to add to your lunatic asylums for mothers. The absence of children leads to neurasthenia in married women, and that leads to insanity. I know from my own practice that it is a fact."

Tinged with sarcasm but coolly logical are the words of Dr. Edward K. Niles, in the Chicago Tribune of March 21, 1931: "As a man and as a physician I resented the following statement of the ministers of twenty-eight Protestant assemblies concerning the use of contraceptives, viz.: 'It is essential to consult the family physician. Not all physicians are willing to teach their parishioners how to do a detestable thing. Let the clergy who admit expert knowledge in distinguishing the true and false in contraceptives give the instructions and not wish it on the doctors! Family physicians, as a rule, have a conscience; so let the burden of spreading these scandals of unnatural acts rest on the heads of those who advocate this offensive form of immorality. Since the end justifies the means, what next? The same sophistical argument justifies criminal abortion and infanticide. Will we not, under the guidance of the clergy, soon reach that high level of Platonism where the family physician, having delivered the child, will be called upon to strangle it in order that the first-born may have a modern college education?"

Absolute and final is the verdict of Dr. Joseph Collins of New York (The Outlook, December 21, 1927): "A lifelong contact with individuals afflicted with nervous and mental disorders should make me a more competent witness than a lay woman. No one can practice any form of birth control systematically and continuously without being injured spiritually and few without being injured bodily."

Clothed in similar terms was the warning of Dr. Joseph J. Mundell, professor of obstetrics at Georgetown University, expressed before a Congressional committee. (Hearing H.R. 5978, January 19, 1934.)

More specific is the suggestion that a new disease of the skull, a cranial bone thickening, may be associated with birth limitation. Dr. Sherwood Moore, director of the Edward Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University, has found evidence of patched and increased bone texture pressing on the brain in 229 cases of 20,000 X-ray pictures examined. Ninety-eight per cent of the sufferers were women, and their medical history shows ailments which in final stages border on insanity. Dr. Moore believes that the cause for this thickening of the skull is "the failure to follow the natural course of reproduction," especially also the failure of these women to have children. If his opinion is borne out, it will strengthen the protest which physicians have raised against the pernicious physical consequences of birth control. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 10, 1935.)

Some specialists have maintained that birth control is sometimes a cause for sterility, neurasthenia, fibroid tumors, and even cancer. One cannot be unaware of course that a long list of medical men have endorsed birth prevention. Yet we can safely rest our decision with the medical opinion of recognized surgeons and gynecologists, in addition to those already mentioned, like the following: in England Dr. C. P. Blacker; Dr. R. Gibbons, physician to the Grosvenor Hospital; Dr. Ernest Ware, surgeon to St. John and Elizabeth Hospitals; Dr. Hector Cameron, physician to Guy's Hospital; Dr. Mary Sharlieb, gynecologist to the Royal Free Hospital; Dr. Bellingham Smith, senior gynecologist at the London School of Medicine for Women; Dr. Arthur E. Gles, senior surgeon of the Chelsea Women's Hospital; Dr. T. W. Taylor, president of the British Gynecological Society; in Holland Dr. M. A. Boodwdijk-Bastiaanse, eminent gynecologist; Prof. Louwer of Utrecht; in Germany Professor Sellheim of Leipzig; Dr. Max Marcuse, medical editor; in Austria Dr. Sigismund Peller, Viennese specialist; in America Dr. S. J. Homes, zoologist of the University of California; Dr. Howard A. Kelley, gynecologist of Johns Hopkins Medical School; Dr. William Gerry Morgan, past president of the American Medical Association, and many others.

This last-named authority brands all contraceptives as "of mone le heatil he de ared shat hen prated fe opposition to birth control" was based, among other reasons, on "the inevitable and unavoidable harm that it will cause to young women through disturbance and disease, ill health and misery." Before a House Judiciary Committee, Mary T. Norton, representative from New Jersey, declared that thirty-three out of thirty-five leading doctors in her State were opposed to the public dissemination of birthcontrol facts. Finally in its 1937 convention, after twenty-one years' prodding, the American Medical Association approved of birth-control teachings and according to a newspaper report authorized medical schools hereafter to teach "how to space babies to protect the mother's health or the father's bank balance." Shrewd editors intimated that the American Medical Association, face to face with the prevalence of birth control, decided that it could not afford to miss the opportunity of controlling the policy of some 350 birth-control clinics in the United States. At the same time it was suggested by skeptical commentators that the medical profession wanted its share of the $600,000,000 annual commerce in contraceptives!

While controllers tell us that they are generally supported by physicians, it is significant that every reputable doctor who has given any endorsement has spoken very guardedly and has conditioned his remarks, usually by stating that recourse to birth control is to be taken only in the interest of personal health. If that qualification were observed, the ranks of its votaries would be surprisingly thin.

### AN OUTRAGE AGAINST NATURE

Birth control must be further indicted because it is an unnatural interference with the processes of nature. We cannot laugh this objection away by a sarcastic jibe and say: "If birth control is unnatural, so is cooking, shaving, and wearing glasses; so are houses, radios, and airplanes." These comparisons are on an entirely different plane and involve no moral or primary issues. The love of children is a basic gift of nature, and for Christians this gift is sanctified by the high and holy regard which their faith places upon childhood. Interference with these natural fundamentals must provoke a cataclysm of tremendous proportion. That perhaps is why a European authority, examining 289 letters submitted in advocacy of birth control, declared that he could not find "a single normal mother among them." In fact, restriction teaches intelligent men and women to do what the lowest animal avoids. Man, God's masterpiece, selfishly violates the sacred law of his Creator. We may well harken to the words of Dr. William Gerry Morgan, who declares: "To establish the habit of thwarting nature is in the long run a dangerous practice and invariably leads to moral degradation and disaster."

### A MORAL DEGRADATION

This suggests the third serious charge. Birth control must be condemned because, immoral, it promotes immorality. In emphasizing the way of escape from the consequences of marriage, it has of course thrown open the door to licentiousness by reducing the unwelcome consequences of promiscuous relations before and after marriage. If it were possible to put into various categories the causes which have contributed to the sexual delinquencies of our day, it would be seen that one of the most potent impulses pushing the sag of American morals to increasingly lower depths is the insistent practice of this prevention.

Newspaper writers, with their literary hand continually on the moral pulse of the nation, have repeatedly conceded this. Miss Genevieve Forbes Herrick of the Chicago Tribune declares: "We are merely reporting that the strict rule of premarital purity is no longer generally enforced, however much it may operate in isolated cases, and that the attitude of young women toward birth control ... has become amazingly lenient in the last dozen years." Miss Gwen Bristow of the New Orleans Times-Picayune admits: "The modern girl does not have to be pure because she knows how to avoid the disastrous consequences of being otherwise. It is a recognized principle of ethics that what constitutes a sin is the evil result of the act."

In a letter addressed to the Hon. Hatton Summers, chairman of the 1934 Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives, Dr. Barton C. Hirst, professor of obstetrics, Graduate School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, summarizes: "I am decidedly opposed to the bill which is to be presented for your consideration on this subject. A number of lay people are interested in this matter not at all for eugenic, altruistic, or medicinal reasons but simply to allow women to escape the usual con-sequences... Unquestionably the spread of this knowledge would increase immorality."

### A DIVORCE STIMULUS

Dr. Alfred Cahan's A Statistical Analysis of American Divorce (New York Times, April 17, 1932) presents some interesting tables on the relation of childlessness and divorce. Classifying the divorces of 1930 and 1931, he showed that abour 63 per cent of all divorces are issued in childless marriages, 20 per cent with one child, 9 per cent in marriages with two children, 3 per cent in marriages with three children, and 1 per cent in marriages of more than three children. His conclusion is unavoidable; it declares that there is "a dismally low chance for success where children do not force the preservation of the home." How fatal to the hysterical claims that "ignorance of birth control is a fundamental cause of infidelity" is Dr. Cahan's mathematical formula: "As the number of children increases, divorce correspondingly decreases at a geometrical ratio"! Conversely, the decrease in the number of children leads to a proportionate divorce-rate increase. Between 1915 and 1929 the birth-rate dropped from 25.1 per 1,000 to 18.9. This 25-per-cent drop in fourteen years was accompanied by a very definite increase in the divorce-rates, from 2.65 per 1,000 to 4.85, a jump of 52 per cent.

From investigations involving ten years and 5,268 divorced men and women, Dr. George W. Crane of Northwestern University shows that an only child figures in divorce hearings much more frequently than a child in a large family. One divorce in two marriages is the result, he claims, when an only child marries an only child, while one divorce in sixteen marriages is the average figure when a "middle" child (with older and younger brothers and sisters) marries a "middle" child. "It is evident," this Northwestern University sociologist concludes, "that with the reduction in size of family we are bound to increase the divorce rate." As the best antidote for divorce Dr. Crane tells brides and grooms: "Join a church and become an active member! Nothing in society will give you greater protection in your marriage. And then — have several children as soon as possible!"

Supreme Court Justice Lewis of Brooklyn, in a survey ot sixty-four undefended divorce cases that came before him in a single day, discovered that there was but one child for every two couples and that these marriages had lasted on the average fewer than three years. As quoted in the press, Justice Lewis concludes: "I have taken this matter up with my associates on the bench, and between us we have tried thousands of undefended marital cases. It is my conclusion that childless homes are responsible for the almost complete absence of real home-life. I cannot help but reach the conclusion that, if our women had children, there would be more happiness and fewer divorces. Presence of children attracts the husband to his home and keeps the mothers from the gossiping neighbors and bridge parties. Absence of children promotes discord. Their presence makes for harmony. I know of scores of cases where the husband remains home merely for the sake of his love for the children. If such men did not have children, they would leave their wives and either get or give a divorce."

### A MENACE TO NATIONAL PROSPERITY

Birth control promotes an undesirable decrease in the population, notably in those elements that are essential to proper national development. Conklin (l.c., p. 347) reflects on the lessons of history: "The decay of the most gifted races of the ancient world, especially those of Greece and Rome, was not due primarily to bad heredity nor to bad material environment, but rather to the growth of luxury and selfishness and unrestricted freedom; marriage became unfashionable, immorality was wide-spread, and then came sterility and extinction or mixture with inferior stock and degeneracy."

And Polybius, who was an eye-witness of this decadence, writes: "In our time all Greece was visited by a dearth of children; ... and a failure of productiveness followed... by our men's becoming perverted to a passion for show and money and the pleasure of an idle life and, accordingly, either not marrying at all or, if they did marry, refusing to rear children that were born, or at most one or two out of a great number for the sake of leaving them well off or bringing them up in extravagant luxury." (XXXVI: 17.)

The late Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn of the American Museum of Natural History, New York City, by no means shared any conservative opinion in anthropological and biological issues; but in his address to the Third International Congress on Eugenics, on August 22, 1932, as reported in the New York Times, he asserted: "Birth control, primarily designed to prevent the overpopulation of the unfittest or dysgenesic, may prove to be a two-edged sword, eliminating alike the fittest and the unfittest. Whatever its benefits in limiting the unfittest, birth control is always in danger still more of limiting the fittest and thus becoming positively dysgenesic or against the interests of the race as a whole in which it is practiced. I have in mind the French, among whom birth control has been practiced in the upper classes for centuries, with disastrous racial results. My doubts about the present propaganda and purpose of the birth-control movement are that they are so largely negative and death-dealing rather than positive and birth-encouraging.... For the time at least I am very doubtful about birth control."

Prof. Ferrand Boudhin of Louvaine University, speaking before the Belgian Natality Congress in Brussels, showed that, unless the birth-rate of Western Europe increased, the present races would be overwhelmed by people from the East with larger families. In our own country, Dr. R. Kuczinski of the Brookings Institution has submitted figures to show that despite the annual surplus of births over deaths the present population of the United States is not reproducing itself and that a grave social danger confronts the nation.

A particularly pernicious aspect of this race suicide is stressed by Prof. Ellsworth Huntington of Yale and Leon F. Whitney, executive secretary of the American Eugenics Society, in their book The Builders of America. While the average number of children in the human race is 4.5 per family, the authors show that the wives of 10,636 Harvard graduates average 1.54 children and that 2,694 Vassar College alumnae average 1.1 children in a family. Mount Holyoke's graduates have the same average. Goucher and Radcliffe report 1 and the Wellesley graduates, as far as the records of the alumnae association of that college show, average .75 children for a graduate. Twenty-five per cent of the Harvard men contracted childless marriages in the decade 1891 to 1900, and this rate of childlessness is steadily increasing.

This unfortunate influence is further summarized by Conklin (L.c., 315): "Johnson has shown that 90 per cent of all the women of the United States marry before the age of forty, but that among college women only half that number have married at the same age. As a result of investigations at one of the leading women's colleges he finds that the marriage and birth rate of the most brilliant students, who have been elected members of Phi Beta Kappa, is lowest of all. Cattell says that a Harvard graduate has on the average three fourths of a son, a Vassar graduate one half of a daughter."

An Associated Press dispatch of June 15, 1933, brings extracts from the address of Dr. Barton C. Hirst, who spoke before the American Medical Association at its annual convention in Milwaukee, in which this physician declared that our retarded prosperity may be directly attributable to birth control habits of the country's "better elements." He asserted: "The immense immigration of late years brought to this country some racial strains that were certainly not the best. These peoples are contributing more than their share to our population. If a breeder of live stock defied the laws of eugenics as we do, he would be ruined. We might well ask ourselves if our loss of wealth, our bad government in cities and States, the impotency of Congress, and the wave of dishonesty that has swept the country are not due to a deterioration in the national character.... An undue limitation of fecundity has been one of the precursors to the extinction of a civilization or the subjugation of a people by a more virile and prolific race. We have already gone some distance on this road."

A special committee reported to the 1936 American Medical Association, representing more than 100,000 of the nation's physicians, and declared, as a result of extensive investigations, "that at present the part of our people with the best education and presumably the most competent socially and economically is not reproducing itself and that birth-control propaganda is partially responsible for this condition."

Dr. J. I. J. Hurst of Cambridge University is no scientific alarmist; yet he told the British Association for the Advancement of Science at the annual meeting in Leicester on September 8, 1933, that "owing to the decreasing birth-rate among the more intelligent families the intelligence index of the population is declining so rapidly as to threaten the safety of modern civilization."

In American Women, 1937-38, containing 7,815 biographies of America's most outstanding women, we read that of these 3,339 distinguished women who are married about 68 per cent had no child or only one child.

Investigations of Prof. Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins University bring the startling conclusion that birth control lessens the birth-rate among the better classes, but increases it among the lower. These findings were based on the interrogation of 2,000 women. Will Durant, noted author and lecturer, told the National Convention of School Superintendents in St. Louis (February 27, 1936) that America is "breeding from the bottom and dying at the top" and that birth control menaces the foundation of our society and government. He charged that "the offspring of the educated are limited, while the uneducated produce most of the children," and that "the sly and devious process of birth control is a dangerous and basic aspect of modern life. There can be no great future for a people bred out of the loins of incapacity and ignorance." He climaxed his remarks by asserting that the decline of Rome set in when the Caesars futilely offered money prizes to the patrician women who would bear even one child and "the future Rome was bred out of the loins of the barbarians within, as you are being conquered now. There is no instance where moral life has long survived the decay of religious belief or where civilization has long survived the decay of moral life. What is happening to civilization and to morality in America?" (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, February 28, 1936.)

No prophetic gift of second sight is required to foresee that, if this childlessness, against which public leaders from the time of Augustus to the day of Theodore Roosevelt have protested, con-tinues, cultural disaster will be unavoidable. The empty cribs in intellectual homes will restrict the intelligence growth of the nation, while all childless marriages will directly contribute to the recurrence of economic crises by minimizing the demand for a growing supply. We could well adapt the argument of Goldsmith's vicar and insist that the honest man who marries and brings up a large family does more for his country than the theorist who only talks of population. Prof. Frank G. Dickinson, University of Illinois sociologist, on January 27, 1936, told the Union League Club of Chicago that the taxes to meet old-age pensions should be levied on all childless couples. In his opinion no generation repays the parents who economized, worried, and worked for its rearing, but that each generation discharges the debt as it rears another group of children. Childless adults dodge payment for their own rearing. If, however, they refuse to pay their obligation to society, the State should be empowered to tax them for the cost of old-age assistance. Mrs. Caroline H. Robinson of Swarthmore, Pa., author and teacher, told the twenty-fifth annual meeting (1937) of the Eugenics Research Association: "First, we should tax the childless for the benefit of large families. Second, preach against race suicide. Third, and most important, give tax relief to self-supporting would-be parents by lowering the relief rolls. The enormous flow of useless and degenerate people must be lessened at its source in both city and country slums. Prof. William MacDougall, while in the psychology department of Harvard University, suggested a bonus system to encourage larger families for professional men and called for a reduction of the salary of all bachelors. He is concerned about the critical acuteness of the situation because he admits: "When the classes of the highest worth are persistently less fertile than the mediocre classes, then they must be recruited on a far larger scale by persons drawn from those mediocre classes. There is the possibility that in the course of a few generations any strains of exceptional ability will through intermarriage with much inferior strains regress markedly." No wonder the authors of The Builders of America declare: "If the present tendencies continue, this is likely to be a sad world two or three centuries hence, when both brains and beauty have been fully weeded out!" No wonder Dr. Morgan, when addressing the annual meeting of the New Hampshire Medical Association in Manchester, charged that America's recovery from depression was "retarded by the trend toward Socialism and birth control, both unwholesome and dangerous doctrines, especially at this period of our national life!" No wonder Louis I. Dublin, life-insurance statistician, warns: "The birth-control movement will have much to answer for unless it can square its account with the American people by emphasizing at this very time the need for correctives of its own activities in earlier years. It has placed bundles of dynamite all over the country. It is now high time that it began to bring back, or at least to remove, the fuses!" (Literary Digest, July 22, 1933.)

### CRAFTY COMMERCIALISM

Another serious objection to birth control is its grasping commercialism. This is shown by a circular distributed freely by a drug store, two short blocks from a St. Louis public school, and published by Medical Bureaus of Information on Birth Control. On the cover, which exalts birth control as "a health necessity in marriage," is a picture of a professional-looking gentleman and under the picture the words: "By Norman Cart, M. D., of London." The obvious intention is to identify Dr. Carr with the picture. This is a rank fraud; for the man in the picture is not Dr. Norman Carr but a professional poser, a model who has appeared in commercial photographs as banker, broker, college professor, actor, World War general, diplomat, social lion, and in many other varied roles. As for Norman Carr, M. D., of London, could no reputable American physician be secured to lend his name to such crafty commercialism? Besides, Dr. Carr is a very elusive character. He is not listed either in the British or the American medical directories, and investigations by the Journal of the American Medical Association seem to indicate that the Medical Bureaus for Information on Birth Control were simply a paper organization, previously called Mothers' Birth-control Clinic, a subsidiary of the company that prepares these preventive devices and materials. The profit-seeking of this ill-famed business looms up in its doubly obnoxious detail when we read the contrast of humanitarian zeal and grasping greed which is found in the literature of the birth-control sales projects. Listen to the mock piety of this paragraph from a widely disseminated birth-control pamphlet: "There are some who say it is not right in the eyes of the Creator. We will allow them to arrogate to themselves the privilege of speaking for God. We are just human beings and claim no divine inspiration. We are willing to rely on that ideal and abide His judgment of a practice than which none other brings so much individual happiness and avoids so much individual misery."

Then read the high-pressure salesmanship in this advertising blurb and see the fine hand of some sales manager behind its despicable traffic:

"Double your money on every sale. The direct-mailed sample (four samples to each physician) and national magazine advertising is putting the spot-light of powerful publicity behind the product that gives you a profit of $8.00 every time you sell a dozen."

There are in our country, according to the estimate of an authority, 300 manufacturers of birth-control devices, and through the euphemisms and double-sense phraseology of magazine advertisements these articles are flaunted before the eyes of the reading public as though all this were not outlawed by the Federal and State laws. Sections 211 and 245 of the United States Penal Code prohibit the sending or receiving by or from the United States mails or an express company any birth-control information or supplies. Yet this illicit business flourishes, and "the average profit on one item ranges from 100 to 300 per cent." (House of Representatives Hearing 5978, p. 142.) A cheap weekly in a recent issue featured with undisguised appeal twenty-three different advertisements for birth-control accessories.

### ITS ANTI-SCRIPTURAL BIAS

To pass over other objections to birth control, — objections so weighty that these sections of the Federal Penal Code make it a criminal offense, punishable by five years in jail or a fine of $5,000 or both, to send through the mails or through other common carriers "any article, drug or medicine, or any obscene, lewd, or lascivious publication intended for preventing conception," — we come to the basic objection, which, if all other argumentation were swept aside, would be a complete denunciation. We refer to the evident indictment of birth control contained in the statements of Scripture.

The majority report of the Committee on Birth Control appointed by the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America states that the Church and the Bible are "silent upon the subject." This is a bold statement. When the first human parent pair was created, the divine command enjoined: "Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth" (Gen. 1:28). After the Deluge, when the world was to take its second start, the blessing for Noah and his sons again required them to "be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth" (Gen. 9:1). In Ps. 127:3 we read:

Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord, And the fruit of the womb is His reward.

The picture of the ideal home is described in Ps. 128:3:

Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house, Thy children like olive-plants round about thy table.

In Prov. 31:28 children are mentioned as part of the virtuous woman's household. If it is objected that these are Old Testament passages, attention is called to these utterances of the New Testament: 1 Tim. 5:14, where the apostle directs the younger women (the widows) "to marry, bear children"; 1 Cor. 7:14, which illustrates God's gracious interest in His children's children; and particularly Mark 10:14, where the Savior of the race utters His memorable "Suffer the little children to come unto Me." In spite of extended argument not a single passage can be adduced from Scripture which even in any remote way condones birth control; and no one acquainted with the Bible should hesitate to admit that it is a definite departure from the requirements of Scripture. See Gen. 38:9, 10.

### THE ATTITUDE OF MODERN CHURCHES

A magazine writer calls attention to the significant fact that many leaders of the clergy, far from frowning on birth control, as the Bible does, recognize it as "essential to the welfare of society." The Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America has officially endorsed birth control. Liberal preachers glory in urging it, and the 1934 annual convention of the Young Women's Christian Association approved a plan whereby local associations would work for laws permitting dissemination of birth-control instruction.

The extent to which the clergy participates in spreading this information may be seen in the Maternal Health Association of Missouri, which spreads across its letter-head the notice that it is "affiliated with the American Birth-control League." On the advisory council of this association are the Rt. Rev. William Scar-lett, D. D., bishop of the Episcopal diocese of Missouri; the Rev. Arnold H. Lowe, Presbyterian and past president of the St. Louis Church Federation; the Rev. John W. MacIvor, former head of the Federation and pastor of the largest Presbyterian church in St. Louis; Rabbi Ferdinand M. Isserman of Temple Israel; the Rev. Ivan Lee Holt, former national president of the Federal Council; the Rev. George Rowland Dodson, Church of the Unity; the Rev. R. W. Adair, executive secretary of the Good Will Industries, St. Louis.

To assist Protestant pastors in advising young married couples, the Federal Council of Churches, through its Committee on Marriage and the Home, has issued a pamphlet entitled Safeguarding Marriages. On page twenty-nine it deliberately counsels the clergymen of its constituency: "For the protection of the health of the mothers and of the children and for the best interests of the family he [the pastor] may want to take up the question of the spacing of pregnancies and of making parenthood voluntary rather than merely accidental. The husband and wife may well be cautioned against postponing parenthood too long. At the same time a word needs to be said about the obligation of welcoming the child if one should come at a time when the parents would not have planned it, since no method of birth control is entirely dependable in all cases. The minister will do well to counsel the young people to avoid unsatisfactory and dangerous methods of birth control. He may well urge the use of the most authoritative books dealing with this matter, and better still, that the couple seek the advice of a physician who is skilled in this subject."

To show how these attitudes permeate congregational life, the instance of the Second Baptist Church of St. Louis may be cited. At the morning service of Sunday, January 13, 1935, the pastor asked his audience to vote on this question: "Is it your Christian conviction that adequate scientific information concerning conception and contraception must be made legally and inexpensively available to all married people in order to permit the development of a race of people capable of establishing the kingdom of God?" Apparently the congregation at this liberal church was not large; but it was birth-control-minded; for fifty-nine ballots answered, "Yes"; two, "Uncertain"; and none, "No." (St. Louis Globe-Democrat, January 14, 1935.)

Protesting in the open forum of The Living Church (Epis-copal), a New Jersey pastor thus summarizes the consequences of the resolution accepted by the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in Atlantic City, by which the dissemination of birth-control information was endorsed: "The result of this resolution is that we now have priests who openly sponsor birth control, open their parish-houses to such meetings and addresses by leaders of the movement." (January 5, 1938.)

Such pronouncements cannot decide the issue. No church attacks on the divine gift of children and the nobility of parenthood can justify birth control. As a matter of fact, however, the great body of Christians throughout the world is deliberately opposed to it. The Roman Catholic Church has repeatedly voiced its uncompromising denunciation. The Lutheran Church is definitely arrayed against birth restriction. As for the action of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ (a procedure that will help to speed up the disintegration of this body), insistent voices of religious leaders all over the country have been raised against this arbitrary pronouncement.

### THE CHURCH'S POSITION

The Church must maintain its emphatic avowal of Christian marriage as God's institution for the propagation of the human race. It must insist that, whenever the divine command "Be fruitful and multiply" is evaded for selfish purposes and through the employment of methods suggested by birth control, divine displeasure is invoked.

This does not mean that the Church establishes an orthodox minimum and insists upon families of ten or twelve children. It has no doctrine of human mass production, nor does it champion the Canadian "$500,000 maternity marathon," started by the extraordinary will of bachelor Charles Vance Millar, Toronto brewer and horseman. He offered a half million to the mother in his city bearing the most children within a decade. Neither does the Church declare that children must follow in rapid succession without sufficient interims for maternal recuperation and infant care. Nor is the health of the mother to be disregarded in the establishment of the family. Her constitution must not be ruined nor her body broken by excessive child-birth. In all of these considerations the Christian principles of love and forbearance must be actuating impulses.

Young couples sincerely concerned over the thought of abnormally large families and the resultant inability to provide adequate means for the cultural growth of their children, should not permit themselves to be disturbed by the alarmist literature of birth-control propaganda. Instead let them consider these five fundamental facts:

First of all, the specter of a prodigal nature that spawns out children and that almost mechanically brings babies year after year in uninterrupted succession is not the picture of nature as it exerts its influences in our lives. There are limits to fertility which are regulated by mysterious factors. The mere physical chances of extraordinarily large families in the average home today (an age that has notable natural trends toward an increase of sterility) are small, particularly in view of the prevalence of late marriages. In Eng-land, Doubleday, Pell, Sutherland, and others have presented strong evidence to show that human fertility is reduced as prosperity, comfort, and intellectuality increase.

Then it dare not be overlooked that "children are an heritage of the Lord," the gift of His rich and undeserved mercy. Thousands of Christian couples have learned by sad and personal experience that this heritage has not been theirs, and even with intense desire and fervent prayer they have been denied the rich blessings from which other short-sighted couples flee in aversion. No child comes into the world without the will and direction of God, and every child born into a Christian home is under all circumstances to be welcomed as the embodiment of a divine benediction.

In the third place, it should be emphasized that there may be certain unobjectionable, if not infallible, means that will help regulate the size of a family. Christian physicians can offer sound advice in emergencies confronting honest young couples who spurn the artificial methods of birth control. The Church has never protested against the employment of those means which the course of nature itself seems to provide, unless their employment is a selfish attempt to evade the responsibilities of parenthood.

The Church also calls attention to continence, self-denial, and restraint. While this often imposes a hopeless struggle on those without the spiritual forces of Christianity, those who take recourse to the power of effective prayer find a sustaining ally in their faith.

Finally, the Church says that in the infrequent and exceptional conflicts between childbirth and maternal health the Christian conscience must seek pastoral advice and the counsel of a Christian physician.

With all this, unusual consideration must be extended to those who have not received the heritage of the Lord from their heavenly Father. No finger of scorn should be pointed at them, no whispers of suspicion raised behind their backs. They should receive the sympathy which Scripture extends to its Hannahs and Sarahs. In their own lives there should be no diminution of heart-deep prayer to the Father above, who "doeth all things well," that the happy gift of parenthood may be theirs. If this blessing is permanently withheld from them, they may find solace when, beholding a helpless infant, orphaned and deprived of parental love and the full opportunities of an unfolding life, they look beyond to see the great Friend of children as He lifts His arms in benediction and tells them: "Whoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth Me" (Matt. 18:5).

### HAPPINESS THROUGH ADOPTION

Since the problems that are concerned with adoption can best be discussed by those who have personally experienced the joys or sorrows of this new relationship, I offer the following personal record written by a "mother by adoption" in the Walther League Messenger (September, 1934). The wife of one of our Western pastors writes:

"My husband and I were married six years. Each Christmas we thought perhaps on the next there would be a little son daughter with whom to celebrate this happiest of seasons. During these years the mail-man would bring those tiny envelopes announcing the great joy that had come to the homes of our friends. There were times when I thought I could not bear it. My yearnings and longings often turned to a feeling of bitterness and resentment, restlessness, and a chronic dissatisfaction with life in general. It seemed as though my prayers were not being answered and my tears were shed in vain.

"Then came a Mother's Day I shall never forget. My pastor, who is also my husband, preached a sermon which apparently was meant for me. It told about Hannah — how she longed with her heart for a child, how Elkanah tried to console her, saying, 'Hannah, why weepest thou, and why eatest thou not, and why is thy heart grieved? Am I not better to thee than ten sons?' I, too, loved my husband dearly, and we were always the best of companions. Yet no husband can take the place of children. Toward the end of the sermon mention was made of those women who had never been blessed with children of their own, but who were taking homeless children to their hungry hearts and giving them their mother-love.

"We had often spoken of adopting children, but rather vaguely, wistfully, and uncertainly. Only one person had encouraged us. However, my mind was now made up, and I was thrilled when my husband gave his whole-hearted consent.

"About a year after having made out our first application God's guiding hand brought us our David. He was just ten months old at the time. As soon as he saw me, he held out his baby arms and began to whimpet the least little bit, begging m he belonged to me. My husband and I both feel that way. The most wonderful thing about adopting children is the love that a father and mother come to feel for a baby they have embraced as their own. It is a marvelous love. Some people may say that it is not the same as having a child of your own flesh and blood. This may be true. It seems logical. However, in the case of Christian foster-parents, who love the souls of their children, nothing can be stronger, nothing deeper, than the love they give their children, which is a love born of love for Jesus, who said: 'Suffer the little children to come unto Me, ... for of such is the kingdom of God.'

"Now, after all these years, we had a baby in our home. We had suddenly become father and mother. Our parents were now grandfathers and grandmothers for the first time, and our sisters and brothers miraculously turned into aunties and uncles. The general interest shown by our friends was delightful. Swings, buggy, walker, crib, kiddie-kar, clothes, - everything came our way, either as an outright gift to our newcomer or lent until there was occasion for its return.

"Having a child in our home gave us a different insight into the lives of our friends and associates. There seems to be a natural bond of understanding between people who have children, for they have mutual difficulties, anxieties, hopes, and aspirations. Now we could speak more freely on child problems because we spoke from experience. Now we realized why parents take such a keen delight in watching their children's minds and bodies develop; but the greatest pleasure of all, we believed, was the joy of watching them develop spiritually.

"When David was going on three years, he expressed in no uncertain terms his desire for a playmate of his own. His father had told him that for whatever he wanted he must pray, and he prayed for a little brother. After about six months of trustful, confident prayer, as only a child prays, his prayers were answered. We adopted a second baby, our Daniel. He was only three months old and not as strong an infant as was David. So it meant a great deal of care, many watchful nights and anxious days. This only deepened our love for him and the feeling that he was our very own. Now he is growing stronger by leaps and bounds; and when he puts his curly head against my cheek and his soft little arms around my neck, I think, as do thousands of other mothers, that, no matter how much trouble babies are, they surely are worth it, for nothing could be sweeter.

"To be sure, there were a few selfish souls who smiled cynically and spoke of our folly each time we adopted a baby. How did we know how our children would turn out or how could we be sure that they would not become ungrateful, they asked. We had never heard that people got such a guarantee with their own children. Anyway, we were willing to take the chance. Self-gratification was not our objective. Our concern, when taking our boys, lay not in what we would be able to get out of them, but what we could do for them. If purely selfish motives prompted one to this great adventure, disappointment might easily follow.

"The best guarantee of children's character is based on a happy Christian home-life and Christian training. We cannot offer our children an abundance of this world's goods, but we can give them the things that will make for a happy, useful life here on earth and eternal blessedness hereafter.

"Perhaps the question asked most of foster-parents is the 'Are-you-going-to-tell-him-he-is-adopted?' inquiry. Personally, it seems incongruous that a mother who would not hesitate to punish a child severely for telling a lie would, on the other hand, say: 'I wouldn't want the baby ever to know that it wasn't our own,' or: 'I am going away for a few months; and if I can get a young enough baby, no one will ever know he isn't our own? Oh, how often we hear of such secrets' 'leaking out! If a sensitive child discovers that it has been deceived, the shock may mar its future. Even if a child is not sensitive, it may never regain the same attitude toward its parents. Its faith in those whom it has trusted most is shattered. Its whole world of dreams tumbles into ruin. It will feel that a secret has been kept from it during these years and that there has not been that perfect frankness, candor, and honesty that engender the finest confidence between parents and children. Just when most in need of parental sympathy and understanding, during those difficult, critical, adolescent years, the child may withdraw into himself. It is heart-breaking not to teli the child, and for this reason many institutions stipulate as one of their requirements that the parents must tell the children before they are of school age.

"If any parents think their children will love them less for it, they should dispel such thoughts. If a child grows up from babyhood knowing the truth about itself, and from its foster parents, feeling their warm love and seeing every day how they care for it, there will be an unconscious and gradual acceptance of the facts. It is not hard to impress the truth upon a child's mind and to let that truth dawn gradually.

"Then there is this to be considered. Realizing their parents' honesty, adopted children will trust them also in all other things. This feeling of absolute confidence, blended with the realization that out of all the world their foster parents chose just them, should bring only happiness and contentment to the hearts of adopted children.

"Did you know that it was easier to get a baby boy than it is to find a suitable girl? Girls are much more in demand. So are babies just over a year. Parents have an idea of their appearance at that stage. They are then at their most cunning age, respond to affection, and are not the care that an infant would be. How-ever, we were willing to take this additional chance. The schedules and the bottles, the strained spinach and the strained orange juice, the strained bananas and sometimes the strained feelings, all made us feel that the boys were so much more our very own. We would not have missed this period of their young lives for anything.

"Our David is now going on five; Daniel is two years old today; I am writing this on his birthday.

"The time has come when we are planning to add a baby girl to our happy family. We are again asking God to bless and to guide us. A few weeks ago I told David he, too, could include in his daily prayers a request for a little sister, which he did. Lately, however, he made a slight change. He is asking God for twins, 'one for Daniel and one for me.'"

A few years later a baby girl of three months was adopted, and the pastor's wife, thrice a foster-mother, wrote:

"Naturally people wonder, and some ask us, why we do it. Are we perhaps financially independent? No, we are dependent on my husband's income, the average salary of a Lutheran pastor. Haven't we enough to do? Yes indeed! To a pastor who dearly loves his work no life is long enough to complete the precious task of winning souls. No pastor's wife who is faithful in her God-given sphere can ever say that there are days and hours when there is nothing to do or that life is dull and uninteresting. Did we adopt children because we thought that we possessed the makings of model parents? No indeed! The multitudinous tasks of parenthood often prove irksome - the regularity of four-hour formula feedings (especially at six A.M.), the strict monotony of daily washings, the patient, unwavering, consistent, and systematic effort necessary to train each baby through its various stages, each phase growing more difficult as the child grows older. You see, it is not an easy task that we have chosen for ourselves. Nothing, however, is impossible, and there is no limit to what we weak human beings can do, with the necessary determination and God-given strength and wisdom from on high. So when evening comes and sleepy-time; when our little ones have knelt with folded hands and said their prayers; when I pause at each little bed with a final kiss and 'God bless you,' my silent prayer rises heavenward that God would make of my little girl or boy a good Christian and of me an ever better mother.

"Do you wonder that we are not surprised when others ask why we took upon ourselves the responsibility of three children? But it did surprise me when, the other day, one of our boys put the innocent question, 'Mother, why did you adopt me?' Our children know that they are adopted. Our lad merely wanted to know why we had chosen him. The story was easy to tell — how we had gone to an orphans' home, hoping to find a blue-eyed baby girl; how the nurse had brought in a brown-eyed baby boy; how he had begun to whimper and hold out his little baby arms to me; how instinctively I had taken him into my arms and, as his sobs were hushed and the tiny hands clung tightly, he had won his way into my heart forever. 'And that baby was you, my dear, and we took you, and your brother and sister later on and, we hope, another little sister if God wants us to have one, all because we love children and you in particular.'

"That, we believe, is the answer most parents by adoption would give if asked 'Why?' They love children. Some men can immerse themselves in their work to such an extent that the absence of children in the home scarcely affects them. Some women seem satisfied and happy without children, using their womanly talents and instincts in the service of others, in church-work, charity, and in helping to rear or spoil nieces and nephews. But oh, the hundreds of would-be mothers whose arms and hearts are aching and longing in vain for one of God's little ones! My heart goes out to you in your aloneness. You wonder why it is that your prayers remain unanswered, why your consuming desire for a warm bundle of babyhood to press against your breast remains unfulfilled. Your friends have had babies. You have gone to their showers with beribboned little presents. You have visited them in the hospital, with a brave little smile on the outside, while inside you were torn with grief and loneliness. Perhaps you, too, have dreamed such vivid dreams that at the time left no doubt as to their being true, only to awaken and find your arms still empty and hot tears of disappointment running down your cheeks.

"Now curiosity and interest might prompt you to ask the question: 'Under what circumstances is it not advisable to adopt a baby, supposing a couple is willing and able?' If the child is not mentally and physically well, it would surely behoove future parents to weigh the added responsibility which such a charge might bring. We believe that you will also agree that it is wrong to adopt a child for selfish reasons; for instance, to apply for a beautiful child so that you can 'do yourself proud' and dress it like a little Lord Fauntleroy or Shirley Temple is selfish and therefore also wrong. Roger Babson says that one of the best investments that we can make in these days of change and uncertainty is — children. But if we do it for selfish reasons, such as our own pleasure, or if we expect something in return, that is wrong. It is true, children multiply happiness in a home a thousandfold, especially during holiday seasons; but should not happiness exist before children are brought into a family? Take a helpless piece of humanity where love and peace do not already reign supreme, and you do it an injustice. You may rear it according to the finest baby specialists' schedules; you may plan its educational and social problems from A to Z, but unless a little one goes into a home where it feels that mother and father are happy together and love each other because they first love the Savior, it grows up in an atmosphere that will sooner or later become detrimental to its finer development. Where there is dissension in the home, the coming of a child may only increase the differences; for example, in the matter of its training. Eventually the child may grow up to cling to either father or mother, taking sides against the other, whether justly or not. Having an ally in one parent, it will refuse to obey the other or, what is even more deplorable, secretly learn to go its own way.

"This brings to mind another question often raised, whether we aren't worried as to how our children will turn out. A friend of mine from one of our Mid-Western towns put it this way: "Why bother about children? You can't tell how they will turn out. When they are little, you work for them, watch over them, and worry about them. Then they grow up, and what have you? They don't respect their elders; they go and do as they please; they get into bad company, and then comes trouble, Poor soul! \* She had two sons. When they were small, all seemed well. For a while they even attended Sunday-school. But the father was an un-believer, a gambler, and a drinker. As the boys grew older, they got into undesirable company and went from bad to worse. Today both are behind penitentiary bars in different parts of the country. — Do such stories of parents with their own children discourage me? you may ask. No, not in the least; but they do show me that there is a great deal of truth in the statement that thought patterns of a child are often formed before it is three years old. Some one has also said that the proper place to begin curbing the crime wave is not in the electric chair, but in the high chair. Above all, such experiences convince me more than ever that Christian training, beginning with babyhood days, and the Christian example of father and mother are of the utmost importance in the life of any child.

"Another well-meaning mother, also with children of her own, put another angle to the question. She observed, 'Oh, well, if your children don't turn out good, you can at least say that you did your best. It is different if they aren't your own? No, a thousand times no! I would rather lay down my life than see one of these children come to harm in body or in soul. The writer of Ecclesiastes says: "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.' If you or I or any one adopts a child with a lukewarm, half-hearted, maybe-he'll-turn-out-all-right-and-maybe-he-won't attitude, then we have no business adopting children. Only if we put forth every effort possible to bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, constantly praying for their temporal and spiritual well-being, can we rest assured that God's gracious will is being fulfilled in us and in our adopted children. In the case of these children such an effort often requires unusual courage. Many foster-parents say, 'I am not going to be so strict because our child is adopted.' They are afraid that without the ties of flesh and blood their hold on the child may not stand the strain. of severe discipline. These are only foolish fears if we remember that there are far stronger ties that bind the hearts of children to the parents. These are the ties of Christian faith and love, which will withstand the severest strains and endure for all eternity.

"To establish and strengthen these ties, we must take as our guide in child-training the best text-book that ever was or ever will be written on the subject, God's own book, the Bible. How simple it is, with God's counsels as our guide, to get the correct answers to even the most baffling problems! And what a blessing it is when God's Word begins to take hold of the child's heart! One day, while I was washing dishes, our little six-year-old, who had just begun his first year in parochial school, came with a towel and the remark, 'Mama, I'm going to dry dishes for you "that it may be well with me and I may live long on the earth."' Of course, we find that some children are not so receptive and responsive as others. For them we must pray more; to them we must come more often with the Word of God.

"After all is said and done, adopting children is truly worth the effort. The joy that our children have brought us during the past years also brings to mind what they have meant to us other-wise. In the first place, our children have brought us closer to our Savior. Since we have had our little flock, prayer has a deeper meaning, and we have come to realize more than ever how dependent we are on Almighty God. Without God at my side I would not want to rear children. It would be too big a job. We have learned that with the adoption of children a finer spirit of cooperation enters the home. Husband and wife learn to appreciate each other more. The added responsibilities bring out the finer qualities in both, which might otherwise have remained dormant and unnoticed. Again, we feel that our children have given us a liberal education, which we could have acquired in no other way. Our youngsters have also taught us to stretch our dollars (sometimes a rather painful procedure) so that we believe we have more good packed into every cent of income and can make it go farther than we have ever dreamed. Since we have adopted the children, we have learned to appreciate and better understand other people's joys and sorrows with their children. We have become thankful for our own parents and for what they did for us in our childhood.

"To my way of thinking there is no greater satisfaction in life than that which comes from having children, helping them grow into God-loving and worth-while, healthy-bodied and healthy-minded young men and women, teaching them self-control, coopera-tion, thoughtfulness, and usefulness. A mother may be 'dog-tired' at the end of each day, so that she goes to sleep almost before she gets both feet in bed. But for real satisfaction, for a constant source of happiness and a worth-while object in life, there is nothing that compares with rearing children. The author who writes a prize novel, the painter who paints a masterpiece, the architect who builds the most beautiful structure in the world, cannot begin to compare his work with that of the father and mother who, with God's help, mold a tiny life that some day may influence thousands and whose immortal soul will one day shine as a star in the everlasting firmament of God's New Jerusalem, when all the perishable masterpieces of men will have crumbled into dust."

Experience as codified by the Child Welfare League of America in its "New Adoption Program" emphasizes the following safeguards that should be extended both to the adopted child and the foster-parents:

1. The identity of the adopting parent should be kept from the natural parent, just as the identity of the natural parent should be concealed from the adopting parent.
2. The family that seeks the adoption should have a good home and a normal family life, with the prospective parents well adjusted to each other.
3. The child selected should have the physical and intelligence characteristics required to meet "the reasonable expectation" and the home standards of the adopting parents.
4. Foster-parents should understand that in adopting a child "they assume as serious and permanent an obligation as do parents rearing their own children."
5. Before formal adoption there should be a trial period in which the child actually resides with the prospective adopting parents.
6. The child to be adopted should "be wanted for the purpose of completing an otherwise incomplete family group, in which he will receive support, education, loving care, and acquire the feeling of security to which every child is entitled."
7. Every possible precaution should be taken to shield the child from any embarrassment connected with his birth, for example, illegitimacy.
8. The question as to whether the child's adoption is to be revealed must be dealt with honestly.
9. The formality of adoption is to be completed without any publicity.
