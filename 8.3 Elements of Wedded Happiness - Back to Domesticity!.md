## BACK TO DOMESTICITY!

She looketh well to the ways of her household - Prov. 31:27

The Knight of La Tour, observant French medievalist and raconteur, tells of a nobleman who, returning from a long sojourn in foreign parts, brought back as gifts to each of his two attractive nieces a gown of ravishing fabric. When he waited to present the dress to the first niece, she took so long in primping that his patience was exhausted, and he stamped off in chagrin. The other niece, when he arrived, was in the midst of baking bread, all covered with flour. Yet, when she burst forth from the kitchen to embrace him and to apologize for her appearance, he was so overcome by her affectionate welcome and the evidence of her domestic acquirements that he presented her with both gowns.

Today, if a twentieth-century uncle should return from a transAtlantic trip bearing the latest Paris creations as gifts to two modern counterparts of these medieval nieces, he might have to keep the gowns if their bestowal were conditioned by evidences of domesticity. The best for which he could hope would be that one of the nieces might be found wielding a determined can-opener on some recalcitrant tin. For, whether we like it or not, there is an unmistakable neglect of the home duties which a generation or two ago were regarded as the indispensable accomplishments of every bride.

Startling figures show the tremendous change that began largely in the last generation. Only one of every four city families still does its own washing; one out of every hundred urban families and twenty out of every hundred farm families have home-made bread. (New York Times, August 27, 1933.)

Similar statistics from other phases of household activities are available. The increase of ready-to-wear clothing reminds us that in most homes the cutting and fitting of family clothing remains only in fading memories. The rapid growth of apartments, with their long list of efficiency features and their janitor service, is one of the characteristic developments of our age. To afford even more freedom, the family hotel appeals to an annually increasing group of the younger married couples and lures them into an existence in which cooking, cleaning, mending, and allied occupations are almost unknown. In the modern helter-skelter many young women have no time and little interest before marriage to acquaint themselves through personal experience with the various household duties, just as after marriage (especially because of the steadily growing number of employed working wives) they may often find even less opportunity for personal supervision of the home.

With all the commendable aspects of this change, the emancipation from domestic duties often contributes to a loosening of the home ties. Where the wife is so preoccupied that she does not have the ability, energy, or time to serve home-cooked, nourishing meals, to keep her home neat and attractive, to care for her husband's wardrobe, and to meet the other duties of housekeeping, we frequently find the beginnings of misunderstandings, petty annoyances, and irritations, which too often assume fatal proportions.

At least this is the warning issued by sociologists. In a Colgate University questionnaire sent to the married men and women listed in Who's Who in America it was found that 15 per cent of the men and 10 per cent of the women listed poor cooking, irregularity in meals, and associate causes as disturbing elements in their home relations.

The Chicago Tribune compiled opinions of Cook County, Illi-nois, domestic-court judges concerning the causes of divorce. Among the most prominent were these: "Poor cooking, diminution of the domestic instinct in the emancipated woman, too many meals served out of tin cans."

In San Francisco, Judge Thomas J. Graham, who has heard divorce actions in that Pacific Coast city for many years, warns young men: "Never marry a girl who has soft white hands when her mother's are roughened by hard work. She won't be a good helpmate."

Conversely, however, good cooking may be an aid to romance and a support of married happiness. When some one asked J. Ogden Armour of Chicago what quality of his wife captivated him most, he stated: "I did not feel especially interested in this young lady, though we were good friends, till one evening her father gave a dinner to a lot of men. I was invited and learned that the cook had left unexpectedly and that the delicious dinner was prepared and served under the direction and supervision of his daughter. I found my way to the kitchen after a while; and I don't think she ever looked prettier than she did in the big gingham apron, her cheeks pink with excitement, a dab of four on her nose, and she was making dishes step about as if by magic. That settled it for me. I decided that what I needed was somebody who took an interest in her home instead of being a mere butterfly."

A visitor to the home of William Jennings Bryan, at a time when a notable group had gathered there to receive election returns, found Mrs. Bryan on the back porch making blackberry jam and evidently neglecting the guests, some of whom were of national importance. Asked why she was so preoccupied with these domestic duties, she replied: "Whichever way the election goes, Mr. Bryan will enjoy blackberry jam with his biscuits."

### THE PRACTICAL HOUSEWIFE

The Church does not advocate a materialistic philosophy of marriage which teaches that the avenue of easiest approach to the male cardiac region is by way of the alimentary system. For the essential requirements of marital bliss are unselfish love, compatibility in religious life, and the happy spirit of camaraderie. All else is secondary, and a marriage that never rises above the food level never reaches the first stage of permanent happiness.

We are also far from championing kitchen drudgery with its drab background of greasy pans and unwashed dishes. Instead we plead for labor-saving, health-preserving devices to unchain the young wife from the kitchen. But we must protest against the vagabond complex, the selfish urge which draws the wife to the country club, the matinee, the literary luncheon, the bridge tourna-ment, but which drives husbands to cafeterias in the first cleft of a widening breach.

Miss Gertrude Fitts, dietician, warns: "If every girl that becomes engaged would spend as much time penetrating her trousseau, there would be many more happy marriages and fewer tragedies of a breakfast marred by muddy coffee, heavy biscuits, and overcooked eggs."

Investigations made purely on a social and economic basis emphasize that the ideal wife cooks, launders, sews, and is a paragon of wisdom "from etiquette to calories and from fashion to cleanli-ness." Through a set of information tests formulated by the Household Arts Education Department of Teachers' College, Columbia University, the following interesting conclusions were reached: "It appears that the ideal housewife is adept at keeping a house, makes and mends both her and her husband's clothing, does the washing of the household, and is an accomplished diplomat and financier. She never groans over her fate of being a home-keeper, and her one object in life seems to be to make home a happier place. She is an old-fashioned mother who shuns delicatessens, is her own laundress.... To be an ideal wife, the model wife must know that tomatoes contain more vitamins than meat or sugar, that baking-powder biscuits should bake for twelve minutes and no longer, that there are two cups to a pound of sugar, and that a quart of milk will make four cups of white sauce. Food, however, is only a minor item in the knowledge of this ideal wife. She dresses her family and herself simply, but in the latest fashions."

Entirely concordant is this statement of Henry C. Herman, professor of chemistry, also of Columbia University: "It may be far-fetched to establish a connection between food values and happy marriages, but this much is certain, that the housewife who has a true knowledge of nutrition will be able to put her family on a diet which will insure health; and where there is health, there is almost certain to be resultant happiness."

### PREMARRIAGE TRAINING

Small wonder, then, that systematic efforts seek to remove the resentment against housework, that protest is raised against rash feminists like a vice-chairman of the National Women's Party, who declared: "There is no reason why a woman should become a slave when she takes the marriage vow; that is what she really does when she contracts to keep house, cook, sew, and raise [sic] children for her board and keep."

To counteract such perversions, we should have schools for home-makers. While the distinction of establishing a school for brides, the first of its kind in the world, belongs to Luther's city, Eisenach, Germany, with its institution for the theoretical and practical problems of the modern wife, called Heimglueckhaus (Happy Home Institute), our Federal Government and our State Legislatures have helped to provide facilities for the training of young women in domestic science. In New York alone there are several hundred centers under the supervision of the State Department of Education where home-making is taught as a fine art. The number of Federally aided home-economics classes in day-schools, evening and part-time schools, has increased steadily. Last year 272 colleges and universities in our country (about one third of the entire number) had courses on the preparation for marriage.

Since most single young women are employed and usually have little opportunity to enroll in extended domestic-science courses, it is true, as the Boston Transcript declares, that "hundreds of young women with only a fraction of the domestic training their mothers had continue their office employment to the very eve of their wedding and then suddenly face the task of housekeeping without previous equipment or preparation."

Where there is a will, the proverbial way will be found. And the very best of the many ways (including the specialized books on this subject, the evening school, the correspondence school, and similar aids) is the practical and detailed work under maternal instruction. Energetic cooperation in the varied phases of the home duties, besides giving substantial help to the mother, often brings its own reward in helping to lay the foundation for wedded bliss strong enough to withstand the whirlwind that may seek to raze its happiness. A young man chooses well when he selects as his helpmate a Christian young woman who, with all other commendable qualities, is guided by a domestic instinct; who, while she may not be perfect in her kitchen technique, is eager to learn and to equip herself with substantial experience. Her charm will come into its full and estimable growth long after the drug-store beauty of a selfish, snob-bish, pampered pet has lost its attraction.

### THE GOLDEN A-B-C OF FAMILY FELICITY

A religious society in Great Britain some time ago sent a copy of the Book of Proverbs to each of its members, under the conviction that its chapters contain a practical summary of wisdom applicable to our modern life problems. If we were to select one portion of this remarkable book that has particular bearing on the contribution which a young wife can make to her home, we should choose these verses from the last chapter, which have well been called "the a-b-c of family felicity" or "the golden scroll of woman's highest attainment":

Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies.

The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.

She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

She seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands.

She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.

She riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens.

She considereth a field and buyeth it; with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.

She girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms.

She perceiveth that her merchandise is good; her candle goeth not out by' night.

She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.

She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.

She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet.

She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.

Her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land.

She maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.

Strength and honor are her clothing, and she shall rejoice in time to come.

She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness.

She looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness.

Her children arise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.

Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.

Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.

Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates. (Prov. 31:10-31.)

Substitute for "wool" and "fax" and "candles" their modern counterparts, and we have divine authority for the emphasis which the Church lays on a housewife's devotion to her home. Despite all insistent claims to the contrary, it is in loyalty to the domestic instinct that young women exert some of their richest influences.
