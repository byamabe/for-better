## 6.1 "KEEP THYSELF PURE"

Create in me a clean heart, O God! - Ps. 51:10

"The moment of formal betrothal is time enough for the first kiss." - This is not a maxim from a Puritan copybook nor a motto from the austere days of samplers. Neither is it the pronouncement of a world-weary octogenarian counselor of youth. It is rather the deliberate verdict of one of America's foremost psychologists, a literal quotation from William McDougall's Character and Conduct of Life (p. 219).

Few earnestly spoken opinions from eminent sources will evoke more challenge. Yet the principle Dr. McDougall enunciates and the protest which he implies merit the approval of every young life that would scale the highest heights of human happiness.

### EXPONENTS OF UNRESTRAINT

The author of Proverbs lists three things too wonderful for himself and four which he knows not (chap. 30:19). This quartet of enigmas includes "the way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid." Commentators have expressed contradictory interpretations in explaining the last and oft-quoted phrase; but whatever its meaning, "the way of a man with a maid," the conduct characterizing the relation between the two sexes, has today become the topic of long-drawn debate.

Those who endorse an unrestrained relation between young people will immediately assert the utter futility of the restrictions which Professor McDougall implies and which the Christian Church has always regarded as ideal. We shall be accused of closing complacent eyes upon glaring evidence; we shall be charged with ignorance of modern trends; we shall be labeled as harmless idealists, with a code of conduct which no modern young person takes seriously. Young people themselves will complain that, if they maintain this reserve and refuse to make concessions to the spirit of the day, they will soon be ostracized. Young women, embittered by experience, will declare that young men take altogether too much for granted, insisting on intimacies even at the first meeting. And in answer comes the countercharge that the man who does not bestow his caresses lavishly must face the social blackball.

The managing editor of a student publication in a large Eastern university asserts that the girl who will not permit liberties "from any fellow who pleases her these days is non-existent." A questionnaire sent by Doris Webster and Mary Alden Hopkins to college students, social-registerites, and members of "cultured society" — groups representing 20,000 young people from Beacon Street, Boston, to Telegraph Hill, San Francisco - reveals, it is claimed, that the average "nice girl" in these circles is far from restrained in her relation with young men.

Sweeping assertions are always hazardous; and while no one who understands today's youth will be inclined to minimize this day's trends, we must not hesitate to say, in the face of an avalanche of contradictions, that this unrestrained attitude is not as universally prevalent as it may seem. No small numbers of young men and women, some even without the Church, have consistently respected the boundaries of a friendly reserve. A book bearing on this question that has attracted wide attention is Thoughts of Youth, by Larry. It is essentially the diary of a student at Lafayette College, compiled from his correspondence. In one of his letters we find these meaningful side-lights on Larry's type of college morality (p. 11): "I told you that Hart had made dates with three girls for us (Hart, Bob, Tinsman, and me) for last night. All three girls are juniors in the high school and are very nice; in fact, they are nicer than the average by a good deal. Perhaps it is because they are so unsophisticated. Anyway we played bridge with Mr. and Mrs. Whitzell (something like that), who are very fine people. Mrs. Whitzell is especially nice, and she kept the bunch pepped up every minute. After we had some sandwiches and cocoa, she went to the piano and played our 'Alma Mater' and other songs, and we all sang. It really was lots of fun. It was so nice and different from most parties, where the mother and father never show themselves for fear they are butting in. I am afraid that I am hopelessly simple and out of fashion and uncollegiate, but I can't enjoy a gang that lives on nothing but mushing and necking and who have absolutely nothing inside their upper stories but nonsense."

We find no reason to assume that this is an isolated attitude maintained by an exceptionally high-minded young man. Any one who has worked with the young people in church groups or in some of the other organized youth interests knows that thousands of splendid young people are motivated by similar ideals. Besides, moral issues cannot be decided by mass actions nor majority vote. The excuse "Everybody is doing it!" can be decisive only to a shallow, blow-with-the-wind mentality.

Nor are the other arguments in behalf of this new freedom of stronger force. Champions of these promiscuous pastimes solemnly assure us that they are character-builders! Harry Elmer Barnes, Russell, and a host of like-minded destructionists emphasize the desirability of premarital experiences. A director of religion in a California college believes that the free-and-easy girls can stiffen "their moral fiber in the exercise of their freedom." He presents, it seems, a Pacific Coast adaptation of the old fallacy that in order to know wrong one must do wrong. Just how a girl who has gone through a series of affairs with a half dozen young men can emerge purer, stronger, and better is a mystery which this academic oracle neglects to solve.

### CHEAP — VULGAR — SORDID!

In this casual love-making the very cheapness of indiscriminate intimacies constitutes one of the most serious charges. When two young people who have enjoyed only a short acquaintance quickly drift into a situation where physical favors are freely asked and just as freely given, the inevitable consequence is the caricature of true companionship, the coarsening of ideals, the cheapening of high emotions.

Even the worldly-wise philosophy which is not moved by motives decisive for the Christian finds this wholesale love-making tawdry, offensive. A feature-writer noted for her sophistication tells the girls in her syndicated circle of readers: "If 'murmurous' is the most beautiful word in the English language, as has been decided by a London authority,... certainly the ugliest, cheapest, and most vulgar word is 'necking.' Doesn't the very sight of that word in print give you a nauseous feeling? If you are sensitive to words, it does: And so does the silly word 'petting.' That simply cannot be idealized, even by adding soft music and moonlight. It is cheerfully and meekly accepting the scraps from the table of a man's affections. It is admitting that you are delighted to be 'anybody's darling' for the evening or the weekend party. It is accepting a 'hand-out' instead of demanding an engraved invitation to the love-feast. It is giving yourself away like a premium or a tobacco coupon. It is not clever nor beautiful. It is just sloppy and childish — and cheap! It is just the sport of cheap sports!"

If even the sense of worldly propriety is outraged, there should be no indecision on the part of the Church. Because the happiness of any individual, the felicity of any family, and the moral progress of any nation depend upon a worthy appreciation of pure love, the clarion call of the Church must reach its youth with this high-souled appeal: God has endowed you with the bloom of youth and the nobility of love. Treasure this as your greatest human gift and for the sake of your own welfare never, especially not for the enjoyment of a momentary pleasure, permit yourself to become involved in any procedure which would tear the exalted emotions down to the sordid level of cheap, tawdry trifling. If you cannot always be popular, you can be right; and if you are right, you are with God; and if you are with God, all of life's intricate designs will be woven together into a sublime symmetry by the Master Weaver of souls.

It is sometimes said that protracted indulgence in familiarities may be detrimental to health; and we leave it to physicians to show how the continued concession to these impulses may work havoc with the nervous system. But even if these physical consequences are avoided, the seemingly insignificant start of lax relationships may lead to the ruthless fracture of the commandment of purity. It may appear harmless to many of elastic judgment that a girl permits a young man with whom she may have but a brief and superficial acquaintance to embrace her; yet in no aspect of present-day life does the old adage about the devil asking for a finger and taking the whole hand find more unmistakable application than in the innumerable instances where the refusal to withstand apparently innocent beginnings has ended in heart-breaking complications.

We may grant that the grace of divine guidance can intervene to avert this extreme; yet promiscuous familiarities often assume such overbalanced importance in the association with members of the other sex that they become an all-consuming obsession. There are essential activities in which normal interests should be absorbed - school, work, home, church, reading, recreation. When young people are not occupied with these varied and wholesome enterprises, a dangerous vacuum marks their lives. Young couples who can enjoy themselves only when they are alone and beyond the reach of restraint, who count their good times by the number and variety of their conquests, will learn by bitter experience how empty and disillusioning their misdirected lives are.

The voice of conscience will be heard. For the followers of Jesus Christ this inner monitor cannot be stifled without invoking regrettable results. Many a young man who thought it an accomplishment to oppose this relentless guide has rued his "achievements" when confronted by a clean, God-fearing young woman whose sterling character served only to emphasize his own inconsistencies. Many a girl has learned to lament the heyday of her indiscriminate popularity when, satisfied in her own small mind that she was chasing happiness, she ran on in this huggermugger way to a nightmare in later years.

Here is a letter, typical of many, that I have received showing the deep scar caused by concessions to impurity:

"I am a young man twenty-seven years old. Do you know what it is to be haunted? I can tell you. I have committed some filthy sins, which haunt me so that often I wish to die. Frequently I have an opportunity to tell other younger boys the proper way, but my past actions do not help any. My life has been a very slipshod affair, and as I get older, I suffer for it more and more. What I would like to know is this: Is it still possible for me to marry and be happy after such gross sins? Everywhere I see nice girls with whom I would like to associate, but I feel that I do not deserve them.... I have some fine Christian friends, but my past always looms before me when I am with them. This is a terrible life to lead. I often wonder why God allows a person to fall into such a terrible mess. And often I wonder, too, whether there is a God. I am the president of a young people's organization and a deacon in the church, but I cannot carry out the duties of these offices as I should because of the taunting thoughts that seep into my mind so often. Is there any peace in this world? Is there any hope that I can become useful in this world?"

No previous generation has ever thrown young men and young women together on such an open and wholesome basis as the present, when segregating barriers have been broken down in our young people's societies, in our new ideas of employment and education. With our unparalleled facilities of recreation, both public and private, and with hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually to provide the very best outdoor sport and play for America's youth; enriched by the far-reaching development of young people's work within and without the Church; surrounded by all the character-building programs and the pleasures of music, literature, art, and the higher forms of entertainment, our young men are not asked to lead the secluded life of the monks at Mount Athos nor are our young women directed to isolate themselves behind zenana walls. Our age has been guided by a healthy motivation in providing varied social interests for its young people. Would to God that these admirable arrangements were not neglected for sordid pleasures!

### "UNCLEAN! UNCLEAN!"

The reluctant discussion on the pages immediately following is offered only because there is a definite need of labeling a sordid complication with a screaming "Unclean, unclean!" We must utterly condemn the moral leprosy fostered by the outspoken approval of apostles of free love, who advocate the unbridled concession to animal desires.

One of the large, widely circulated magazines uses a full-page advertisement to focus the attention of its readers on the question, "How important is virtue among the girls of today?" Beneath this arresting head-line we read that Leila Darrow "has just returned from the country-club dance; she is troubled about her friend Constance, who is recklessly in love. Leila and her mother Helen have a confidential talk.

"'I believe in virtue,' says Helen Darrow. 'I have brought you up to believe in it. I don't understand –"

"'Can't you try to, Mother? Can't you realize that the girl of today does not think virtue so awfully important?'"

Does Leila Darrow represent the average attitude of the American girl today? More specifically, does she speak the language of the girls in the churches of Christ?

A symposium of opinions offered by seventeen newspaper women, representing as many sections of the country, showed a substantial agreement in the charge "that young women no longer cling tenaciously to premarital chastity." For instance, Miss Linda Helfant of the Springfield Republican staff believes: "Virginity used to be a virtue greatly desired and respected. Even the girls who had lost it pretended that it was still their most precious possession and would defend their reputation with their last breath. Fashions in morals change. Nowadays there are plenty of girls who freely admit the lack of it and some extremists who, silly as it may seem, are almost boastful on this point."

Even more sordid are these pessimistic pronouncements of another modern writer: "The young people of today do not believe in the sanctity of marriage any more than they believe in Santa Claus; and there is no use in pretending that they do." He claims that before marriage they have been involved in affairs "with half a dozen or half a hundred other people." "Like it or not," he insists, "these are the facts as I get them from all classes, ranks, and conditions of society." (Arthur Davison Ficke, in Calverton and Schmalhausen, I. c., 660.)

To bolster his revolt against the marriage order, Ben Lindsey drew this disheartening picture: "More than 40 per cent of the boys violate the moral code before they are past school age and at least 75 per cent of our girls do so." (The Companionate Marriage.)

We have all learned to suspect the claims advanced by those who operate with percentages so large that they become almost sweeping generalities. We are entitled to ask how these agitators arrived at such definite percentages when 200,000 clergymen throughout the land can denounce these claims. Mr. Lindsey is not the only youth counselor of the nation; and when one has had the privilege of working with large groups of young people throughout the land, as the writer has, he knows, from personal consultations, from wide contacts, that in church circles the young man or young woman who has had illicit relations belongs to a signifcantly small minority. Far from closing our eyes to the obtrusive evidence of immorality, we must condemn the brandishing of fictitious statistics, the manufacture of tendential evidence. These proportions of impurity may hold for Helga, Phyllis, the irresponsible Henri, the phantom-lover Millie, Hattie, "the home-breaker," and the other psychopathic cases that Lindsey cites anonymously in his book. But bring all the inconsistencies and moral lapses that may find expression in the life of true church-members, and still this total, as lamentable as it is, will be far removed from the impeachment of the Church's youth which brands at least three out of every four of our young women as immoral. It is worth mentioning that Kathleen Norris (Companionate Marriage, p. 4) likewise takes emphatic exception to Lindsey's sweeping claims. She writes: "I have my own channels of communication with America's youth, too. I have hundreds, thousands, of letters yearly from girls of fourteen and sixteen and eighteen. And from them I know that there is honor still among the youngsters in our factories and offices and high schools and that the girl who is too free with the boys, who is 'fast,' who gets into 'trouble,' is the exception still, as she was when I went to school and when my mother and grandmother went to school."

Ill-conceived and unfounded generalities that assail the morals of decent young men and women are often the desperate resort of irresponsible minds. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is preached today with the regenerative impulses that it has always exerted. The Holy Spirit still sanctifies and cleanses the hearts of twice-born children of God.

It is equally evident, however, that American young people have never stood face to face with an alliance of temptations as alluring as the reign of laxity and impurity in the modern decadence. Traffickers in licentiousness are not only accorded repeated opportunities to air their programs for moral chaos, but they are also applauded as they brazenly advocate innovations tantamount to the freest of free love. Youth hears destructionists who prate on the theme "Man is instinctively polygamous" and who would lead gullible disciples to follow these instincts. Youth listens to the twisted, crooked mentality of subversive teachers who insist that repression is unnatural, that biological urges must be obeyed if mental and physical equilibrium is to be preserved — a shallow alibi contradicted by the evidence of the most reputable physicians. Youth overhears the lectures of birth-control exponents, who have advertised their wares with such a despicable lure to lewdness that, according to the admission of radicals, the dissemination of birth-restriction literature has helped to sky-rocket the staggering figures of promiscuity. Youth surveys the whirl of life, and, beholding open immorality, sometimes wonders whether the Church's inhibitions may not be based on a pensioned philosophy.

That doubt expresses itself; and from a mass of similar material I choose lines like these, written me by a Nebraska young woman, a church-member: "In a situation where two normal young people are in love and intend to marry, aren't the marriage vows merely custom? Aren't two young people joined before God even before they speak the vows? ... Oh, I'm not a child; I'm nineteen years old, and that is old enough to know of what I speak!

This suspicion is sometimes supported by the erring counsel of its own elders. The Forum for July, 1936, offers under the title "Twentieth Century, Limited" a paganized exaltation of lust, submitted not by a radical, but by "a modern mother, a West-chester County (New York) matron." In her brazen code of free love this mother deliberately tells her daughter and today's young people that "some experience" in sex is "an essential part" of our "new system of sane sex education"; that unmarried lovers can break down all barriers as long as they have "a strict adherence to some reliable means of control"; that before marriage young people can go the limit in intimacies, provided they show "good taste in choosing their mates and a normal restraint in restricting the number of people with whom they become intimate."

There can be no well-founded doubt that large sections of American society, particularly in circles outside the Church, are described in significant sections of Psychological Factors in Marital Happiness, by Lewis M. Terman. This study, based on findings of a questionnaire answered by 760 husbands and 777 wives, seems to show that premarital chastity has lost much of its significance. The author declares that the majority of men and women born before 1880 were taught to believe that premarriage relations were the most shameful of all sins, especially for the woman. Dr. Terman contend that the swing to the opposite "is proceeding wish extraordinary rapidity." Among the husbands in the group, 50.6 per cent in the oldest section and only 13.6 per cent in the youngest had avoided all premarital experience. The corresponding drop for wives is from 86.5 per cent to 31.7 per cent. Now comes the startling conclusion, "If the drop should continue at the average rate shown for those born since 1890, virginity at marriage will be close to the vanishing-point for males born after 1930 and for females born after 1940." Calmly does the author observe, "It will be of no small interest to see how long the cultural ideal of virgin marriage will survive as a moral code after its observance has passed into history."

### THE SPOLIATIONS OF LUST

The Church's answer to this philosophy of applauded lust is based on more substantial ground than the mere consensus of civil morality. It impeaches free love, in the first count, on the charge of violating the code of purity established by divine Law. In the guide for human conduct given by God Himself the sins of impurity and fornication are condemned with emphatic severity and ominous repetition. Scripture recognizes no adjustment to the spirit of the times, no arbitration in this discussion of decency, no euphemistic masquerade. Its commands are sharp, final, sweep-ing: "Flee fornication" (1 Cor. 6:18). "Be not deceived; neither fornicators nor idolaters ... shall inherit the kingdom of God" (1 Cor. 6:9, 10). "This is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication" (1 Thess. 4:3). "Neither let us commit fornication" (1 Cor. 10:8). "Fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you" (Eph. 5:3). These and a score of other pointed passages label sex laxity with its right name: it is ugly, damning, soul-destroying. In the very face of those who seek to laugh away these lapses as the sowing of wild oats, the Scriptures with their immaculate standard of purity condemn even fleshly desires and brand lustful acts as heinous sins, for which the retribution of God has commensurate punishment.

As regularly and inexorably as darkness follows the day, the furies of avenging justice will track this sin to its lair. So relentless are God's laws of purity that their violation is often penalized by some of the most appalling punishments known to men. Impurity is frequently productive of unspeakable physical suffering, the cause of devastating social diseases, which rank "with cancer and tuberculosis as a chief cause of illness, death, and economic loss," according to a New York State Department of Health bulletin. If young people who have been surrounded by Christian influences cannot estimate the frightful terror of these repulsive diseases and are inclined to minimize their loathsomeness, let them visualize this picture which paints the repugnant consequences of sexual sin: "To recognize the full character and effect, you would have to compel the world to throw open the doors of all its hospitals and expose to view the moral lepers whose flesh and bones reek with rottenness and death, and as you pass from ward to ward, it would be necessary to require your attendant to call diseases by their real names and tell you the true relation of the many aches and ills to this one terrible disease of diseases which visits its judgments upon the children of its unhappy victims even unto the third and fourth generations; to throw open the doors of the insane asylums to show you the large number of their unhappy victims; to throw open the doors of the sepulcher and show you the bodies of the slain."

While the occurrence of these diseases has been grossly overestimated by propagandists (Margaret Sanger, birth-control advo-cate, claims that in New York City alone four out of five married men and three out of five married women have the most prevalent form of social infection and that 50 per cent of the adult population of the entire nation has similarly suffered, What Every Girl Should Know, p. 71 ff.), it has been shown by Albert G. Love and Charles B. Davenport in their Defects Found in Drafted Men (pp. 73 and 74) that among 2,510,791 men in the selective draft of the United States Army (1917—1918) 89,393, or about three and one third per cent, were victims of three loathsome diseases. If this ratio, established even with inadequate methods of diagnosis, held for the entire population, there may have been about a million and a half men in our country at that time who were similarly afflicted. When the number of infected women is added, it will be evident that impurity provokes the greatest disease epidemic in the country.

Sir William Osler calls one of these insidious maladies "the greatest killing disease among infections." A large life-insurance company describes it as "mankind's most dangerous enemy." A companion disease is called "the great sterilizer," because it is "responsible for many childless homes." Describing the ravages of one of these contagions, medical authorities tell us: "Every bone and tissue of the body is subject to its attack. It causes blindness, deafness, heart disease, and other serious disabilities, including mental disorders and crippled limbs. Especially cruel are its attacks upon unborn children."

Some forms of this contamination are curable; but others lead to idiocy, paralysis, blindness, locomotor ataxia, paresis, the disintegration of internal organs, and finally to horrible death. The Public Health Institute of Illinois, organized by public-spirited citizens as a "not-for-profit" corporation, declares that each year the two most frequent social diseases attack 1,555,000 Americans, 60 per cent more than pneumonia and 14 per cent more than cancer, tuberculosis, typhoid, and heart and kidney diseases combined! Dr. Thomas Parran, United States Surgeon-General, warns that the most frequent of these diseases "infects one adult in ten at some time in life." The United States Public Health Service is authority for the statement that "various conservative estimates attribute from 10 to 20 per cent of organic heart disease in middle age to this cause." Any physician can describe in harrowing details what the sage of the Old Testament means when he warns his son against impurity "lest thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed" (Prov. 5:11).

In a survey conducted for the Missouri Social Hygiene Association by H. C. Loeffler and printed as Costs of Venereal Disease to St. Louis, it was shown that the loss from these diseases consequent to impurity in metropolitan St. Louis ranges between a minimum of $2,071,000 and a maximum of $2,560,000 annually for a year like 1932. The report adds to this: "Many additional venereal-disease costs are not susceptible to financial analysis. During normal periods of business activity general economic loss would loom even larger than the above estimates." If this rate obtains for the rest of the United States, the national cost of venereal disease, as far as this may be computed, would range between $240,000,000 and $300,000,000. Several items in this appalling cost are presented by Dr. Parran, who estimates that every year more than $31,000,000 is spent for those who have become insane in consequence of one of these diseases and that another $10,000,000 is demanded for the care of those who have turned blind. Incomputable is the cost of the 40,000 who die every year from resultant heart conditions, likewise the expense of treating the 160,000 who suffer from heart disease and the half million new cases of this social disease that every year report for treatment. The loss to industry from various venereal diseases has been computed in a pamphlet published by the American Social Hygiene Association, Hidden Costs in Industry (Publication No. 751). Here we read: "A summary of available information indicates that among the general male population between the ages of 15 and 45, the number of days lost from work through venereal disease approximates at least 21,000,000 per annum. At an average rate of $4 per day this amounts to $84,000,000 in wages lost to the men themselves, to say nothing of the cost of employers in compensation, relief, and medical attention plus the difficulties of labor turnover and temporary substitute employees."

"Another example of waste through venereal disease," Hugh S. Cumming, until 1936 Surgeon-General of the U.S. Public Health Service, tells us in the American Social Hygiene Association Publication No. 789, "is the loss due to a shortened life-span. A man who eventually might earn $2,500 a year is estimated at the age of twenty to be potentially worth over $30,000, representing the excess of his earnings above living costs during a normal life time. His death earlier than that means the loss of part of this amount to his dependents."

Terrifying beyond words is this penalty which violated chastity demands; but even more appalling is the price this scourge exacts from the innocent. A clean, healthy girl who marries a tainted young man will probably become infected and may be doomed to sterility, serious operations, chronic invalidism, and broken health. The sex sins of the fathers (or of the mothers) are visited upon the children in no more tragic form than in the hereditary communication of these social maladies. It has been estimated that 80 per cent of the blindness in new-born infants is due to parental sin. Government authorities claim that two thirds of the cases of opthalmia neonatorum (baby's sore eyes) are of venereal origin. The Venereal Disease Manual, published by the United States Public Health Service (pp. 13, 14), tells us that babies born of diseased parents often look old and withered. We read: "A child so afflicted may apparently improve and appear healthy until the age of puberty, when the disease may break out afresh. Then a child of fifteen may have the appearance of a man of thirty, or the reverse may be true — a child of fifteen may resemble in facial expression a child of eight or nine."

"Recent studies in the United States show that an average of one out of every twelve expectant mothers coming to prenatal clinics for advice is infected." The American Social Hygiene Association informs us that this congenital contagion, "passed on to the child from the mother before birth, is the cause of thousands of mis-carriages, still-births, and early deaths. Of the infected infants who are born alive a large proportion die young. Wasted and deformed bodies, skin rashes, ugly sores, bad teeth, blindness, deafness, paralysis, mental defects, and other manifestations similar to those appearing in the adult forms of the disease may be their lot."

The most wide-spread of these venereal diseases has been called the Public Enemy Number 1 of American children, because it touches 60,000 infants every year. It is the largest single cause for still births and one of the major contributing causes to the death of infants in their first weeks. One third of the new-born babies affected in this way will become blind unless they have adequate treatment.

Besides the ravages of these diseases, which can be adequately described only by medical authorities, the sins of impurity are fraught with other serious perils. In spite of all contrary assertions an unwanted child and the curse of illegitimacy are ever present dangers. Society may permit the sinning father to escape without suffering any serious punitive measures, but its double standard will not grant the unmarried mother entrée into its homes. The scarlet letter is still the stigma of an outrage against propriety that even modern liberality has not learned to condone. The unnamed child, handicapped by the heaviest social burden that human selfishness can ever impose, is marked for life. Even a forced marriage, solem-nized in the effort to make the best of a deplorable situation, is often nothing more than a sentence to a lifelong loveless union, cursed by a rage of resentment.

To avoid parenthood, recourse is often taken to the illegal and criminal destruction of life. Writing in the Pictorial Review (January, 1937), Gretta Palmer claims that almost 700,000 babies are annually murdered in the United States through abortion. In these illegal operations more than 8,000 women annually lose their lives. What the others lose in sickness, sometimes in sterility, lifelong invalidism, and insanity cannot be computed. Yet, despite birth-control publicity, this heinous murder increases. The Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor gives a somewhat more conservative estimate but still asserts that in our country one abortion occurs every forty-five seconds. Dr. Frederick J. Taussig of Washington University, St. Louis, Mo., in his technical book on this subject, substantiates the higher figure and estimates that 681,600 abortions are performed annually in the United States, with about 10,000 resultant maternal deaths.

Suppose for a moment that by some miracle of grace all these calamitous consequences are avoided and uncleanness exultingly escapes any tangible requital. Even then lechery reaches out for revenge. Premarital unfaithfulness is often the prelude to post-marital infidelity. The rake who has spent the years of his youth in heedless sin will not be transformed overnight into a paragon of husbandly virtue when restricted by the ties of matrimony. The dissolute girl who marries to reform will find that her capacity for the pure and the beautiful has been destroyed. It is an exacting taskmaster, this scourging vice; and when the thongs of its lash have once become embedded in the flesh of its slave, it is only by superhuman energies that its hold can be broken.

One of the clearest proofs of this truth is experienced by those who transgress God's command. Here is a disheartening confession from my radio mail, which I quote because, far from being an isolated record of these experiences, it exposes a wide-spread danger against which the Church must work and warn:

"I met — at our church; we started 'going steady' and were deeply in love. He showed me a wonderful time. We were planning to be married last fall or this spring. He was a poor church attendant, and I got him to come every Sunday; he joined our societies. He used to tell me over and over again how strong his love was for me and that it would not end until death severed it. I got him so that he did not drink any more or go to dances. I was so proud of him and he of me! He was always showing me off! He told me and his relatives that he had found the one with whom he wanted to spend the rest of his life.... I hardly know how to tell you the next step, which has proved to be my downfall. We broke the Purity Commandment.

"I've asked God for His forgiveness on bended knees, but I've got to get the burden off my conscience. It's driving me mad. I'm getting so nervous and am losing weight. ... People are wondering what's the matter with me, and they ask me if it was a disappointment in love. Am I a condemned person for life? Will I ever be able to marry any one else? Sometimes I walk around in a daze and hardly know what I am doing."

From the South another young woman writes:

"Will you pray for me? I'm so wicked! Do you care to listen? For two years I've lived in sin. I knew all the time I was going wrong; at night I could not pray. It would not have ascended even out of my room. But I am so weak — and I love so desperately! In September I left — for — University here to study. I left home, also my love, but my sin goes with me. It is such a fight, and I cannot feel forgiven! It has gone so far that last night I was going to give up! How can I be among God's elect when I have such doubts? But if you will pray that I may be strong and feel that God has forgiven me, perhaps I can pick up the broken threads and carry on."

Besides the qualms of conscience there often follows the bitter realization that the person with whom the command of purity was broken discards the partner in sin. One of the two letters just cited explains:

"Now he is taking out a night-club girl. She is keeping him out until 4:30 Sunday morning, and then he cannot get up in time for church. It has torn my heart all to pieced!"

And another girl writes:

"Yesterday I received the news that this man, the one I loved, is engaged to my best friend. It is such a blow! I am crushed!"

The deepest woe of this spoliation by lust is the relentless tyranny by which it seeks to keep its victims shackled in sin and separated from God. Impurity, of all vices, is the quickest to choke off spirituality and stifle the voice of conscience. Deprived of the truest and best of this life, its victims will be judged by God in the next. "They which do such things will not inherit the kingdom of heaven" is the formal sentence pronounced by the Word of God (Gal. 5:21). It is repeated in substance not only in Prov. 5:22; Heb. 13:4; Eph. 5:5, where all unclean persons are denied any "inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God," but also in the incisive utterances of Rev. 22:15, on the last page of the Bible, in which carnal-minded "dogs" are doomed to exclusion from the glories of the New Jerusalem and its tree of life.

"Be not deceived, God is not mocked."

### PREMARRIAGE EXAMINATIONS

Because the ravages of these diseases are so horrifying and entail tremendous losses in money, mind, health, power, and hap-piness, many States have passed premarriage examination laws. Where these regulations are in force, the examination usually follows this course: Within fifteen days of the expected date of marriage the young couple has blood tests made. If the results are negative, the marriage clerk or recorder of deeds grants the license to marry.

It is claimed, perhaps with exaggeration, that this clean bill of health will be given to almost 98 per cent of applicants. The remaining 2 per cent must be treated and cured before the marriage license can be issued. Two per cent seems a negligible number. Yet the suffering and sorrow that can be removed and the check on the spread of this disease through the premarriage tests combine to make us endorse this legislation.

These laws are no complete safeguard, because it has been shown that thousands of couples skip over State borders to other communities in which these laws do not apply. It is also true that they can assure the absence of disease only at the time of marriage. Yet, even with such restrictions these regulations of prenuptial tests will of necessity reduce misery by curbing disease.

Whether or not the legislation of this health test is approved in all States of the Union, we suggest that all prospective husbands and wives make it their personal duty to subject themselves to this examination before marriage. Young people ought to banish all thoughts of embarrassment, rejecting particularly the suspicion that this visit to the physician might be regarded as showing a lack of mutual trust. Some of these diseases can be acquired in an innocent manner, and for a while the victim may not be aware of its presence. Therefore it is simply good common sense and the requirement of our plain duty to take all necessary precautions. Our age has abundant reason for thanking God that through medical advancement within this generation most of these diseases may be cured, if treated early enough and long enough.

### STRENGTH IN CHASTITY

Defenders of free love have not hesitated to brand the Christian emphasis on premarital chastity as "emotional bondage ad of Morals," in the Forum, July, 1928) pronounces this credo of lust: "Abstinence is nervously and mentally undesirable." A chorus of those who have championed the overthrow of restraint chants the same litany of lust; but it would be hard to find a group of reputable physicians who would subscribe their names to this statement.

On the other hand, qualified investigators unanimously maintain that loyalty to the Biblical standards of chastity before marriage is "not harmful but rather beneficial and that the idea that continence is a cause of nervous diseases is incorrect." The Modern Psychologist (August, 1936) printed a challenging summary of the best medical opinion, as this has been gathered by the careful statistical research of Dr. Jacobsohn, who corresponded with 200 recognized leaders among professors of physiology, hygiene, mental diseases, nervous diseases, and psychiatry. His symposium reveals decisive statements like these: "The conventional view that incontinence in men is a necessary condition of health must be corrected. Instead of the popular fallacy that a young man is physically the worse for a clean, moral life, the entire weight of evidence of the world's foremost medical scholars is unreservedly of the opinion that he is the better for it. It is recognized by the highest authorities that continence is entirely compatible with the most perfect health. Chastity, properly understood, is health: it never does any harm to mind or body."

De. Bruce of the University of Oklahoma, author of Health Science and Health Education, writes: "Abstinence and conformity are detrimental to no man's health."

Some time ago the International Brussels Congress issued a declaration to the effect that "a clean moral life for a man is not prejudicial to the health, but on the contrary is to be recommended from a purely hygienic standpoint. It is the consensus of most of the great medical thinkers." In this opinion it agreed with a similar pronouncement by the medical faculty of Christiania Uni-verity: "The assertion that a chaste life will be prejudicial to health rests, according to our unanimous experience, on no foun-dation. We have no knowledge of any harm resulting from a pure and moral life."

With these decisive verdicts does the best modern medical science endorse the Scriptural blessings of chastity and indict the reign of lust.
